Synthesis and in vitro cytostatic activity of new b D arabino furan[1 0 ,2 0 :4,5]oxazolo and arabino pyrimidinone derivatives a b s t r a c t A series of nucleoside derivatives was obtained via heteroatom annulation of the amino oxazoline of D (À) arabinose. Unequivocal proofs for the stereostructure of some new arabinosyl pyrimidinone derivatives were obtained by X ray structure analysis. These newly synthesized compounds were then evaluated for their cytostatic activity against murine leukemia (L1210), and human T lymphocytes (Molt 4/C8 and CEM). Of all the compounds in the series, the protected silylated tricyclic fused pyrimidinone 10 showed the most significant antitumor activity against murine leukemia L1210 (IC 50 ¼ 6 mM), and human T lymphocytes cells Molt 4/C8 (IC 50 ¼ 7.9 mM) and CEM/0 cell lines (IC 50 ¼ 7.5 mM). None of the compounds exhibited significant antiviral inhibitory activities."	0
1	The beginning of 2020 brought us information about the novel coronavirus emerging in China. 39 Rapid research resulted in the characterization of the pathogen, which appeared to be a member 40 of the SARS like cluster, commonly seen in bats. Despite the global and local efforts, the virus 41 escaped the healthcare measures and rapidly spread in China and later globally, officially 42 causing a pandemic and global crisis in March 2020. At present, different scenarios are being 43 written to contain the virus, but the development of novel anticoronavirals for all highly 44 pathogenic coronaviruses remains the major challenge. Here, we describe the antiviral activity 45 of previously developed by us HTCC compound (N (2 hydroxypropyl) 3 trimethylammonium 46 chitosan chloride), which may be used as potential inhibitor of currently circulating highly 47 pathogenic coronaviruses  SARS CoV 2 and MERS CoV. : bioRxiv preprint 65 pneumocytes in human airways, hijacking the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to 66 enter the cell, similarly as SARS CoV and HCoV NL63. 67 MERS CoV is related to SARS CoV 2, but together with some bat viruses forms 68 a separate Merbecovirus subgenus. Bats are believed to serve as an original reservoir also in 69 this case 10 , but camels were identified as the intermediate host 11 . The virus never fully crossed 70 the species border, as the human to human transmission is limited, and almost all the cases are 71 associated with animal to human transmission. The entry receptor for MERS CoV is the 72 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) 12,13 . In humans, MERS CoV causes a respiratory illness with 73 author/funder. All rights reserved.

8	"The detection of serum antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is emerging as a new tool for the coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis. Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56 ℃ prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS CoV 2 antibodies is still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS CoV 2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56 ℃ for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS CoV 2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID 19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non COVID 19 diseases group (n=9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cut off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false negative results of these samples. Our results indicate .

After the announcement of lockdown in Italy on 9 March 2020, situation was becoming stable since last days of March. In view of this, it is important to forecast the COVID 19 evaluation of Italy condition and the possible effects, if this lock down could continue for another 60 days. Methods: COVID 19 infected patient data has extracted from the Italian Health Ministry website includes registered and recovered cases from mid February to end March. Adoption of seasonal ARIMA forecasting package with R statistical model was done. Results: Predictions were done with 93.75% of accuracy for registered case models and 84.4% of accuracy for recovered case models. The forecasting of infected patients could be reach the value of 182,757, and recovered cases could be registered value of 81,635 at end of May.
Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of country lockdown and self isolation in control the disease transmissibility among Italian population through data driven model analysis. Our findings suggest that nearly 35% decrement possible."	0
10	"The fast spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) has become a global threat hitting the worldwide fragile health care system. In Italy, there is a continued COVID 19 growth of cases and deaths that requires control measures for the correct management of the epidemiological emergency. To contribute to increasing the overall knowledge of COVID 19, systematic tests in the general population are required.
Here, we describe the first Italian survey performed in 727 employees belonging to a Mother Child
Research hospital tested for both viral (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) and antibody presence. Individuals were divided into three risk categories (high, medium and low) according to their job activity. Only one subject was positive at the swab test while 17.2% of the cohort was positive for the presence of antibodies. Results highlighted that the presence of Positive antibodies is significantly associated with high and medium risk exposure occupation (p value=0.026) as well as cold and conjunctivitis symptoms (p value=0.016 and 0.042 respectively). Moreover, among healthcare professionals, the category of medical doctors showed a significant association with the presence of antibodies against SARS CoV 2 (p value=0.0127). Finally, we detected a rapid decrease in antibody intensity between two assessments performed within a very short period (p value=0.009). Overall, the present study increases our knowledge of the epidemiological data of COVID 19 infection in Italy, suggesting a high prevalence of immune individuals (i.e. at least among at risk categories) and outbreak."	0
11	Background: As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus. Methods: In this study, we developed a Bats Hosts Reservoir People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats Hosts Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS CoV 2. Results: The value of R 0 was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58. Conclusions: Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS CoV 2 was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe Korea.	0

13	A six year old neutered female albino ferret was presented with an acute episode of lethargy and anorexia. Clinical examination revealed marked cranial abdominal pain. A severe neutrophilic leukocytosis was present. Abdominal ultrasound was consistent with a diffuse peritonitis and severe bile duct inflammation. Cytology of the abdominal effusion revealed bile peritonitis. An exploratory laparotomy was performed and the gall bladder appeared inflamed with multiple perforations. A cholecystectomy was performed. The ferret recovered without complication. Bacteriological culture of the bile and gall bladder yielded a pure growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Histopathological analysis of the gall bladder and liver was consistent with a marked cholecystitis and cholangiohepatitis. On the basis of sensitivity testing, the ferret was treated with marbofloxacin for one month. No complications or reoccurrence were seen up to 1 year after the diagnosis. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report of bile peritonitis secondary to gall bladder rupture in a ferret.	0

15	"Aim: The Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak is a major threat to human beings.
Lung injury has been reported as the major outcome of COVID 19 infection. However, liver damage has also been considered to occur in severe cases. Current meta analysis of retrospective studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between liver injury and severity of COVID 19 infection.
Methods: Online databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched to detect relevant publications up to 1 April 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, a fixed or random effects model was used depending on the heterogeneity between studies. Furthermore, publication bias test and sensitivity analysis were also done.
Results: In total, 20 retrospective studies with 3,428 COVID 19 infected patients (severe cases = 1,455 and mild cases = 1,973), were included in this meta analysis. Higher serum levels of Aspartate aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 8.84 U/L, 95% CI = 5.97 to 11.71, P<0.001), Alanine aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 7.35 U/L, 95% CI = 4.77 to 9.93, P<0.001), total Bilirubin (weighted mean difference = 2.30 mmol/L, 95% CI = 1.24 to 3.36, P<0.001) and lower serum levels of Albumin (weighted mean difference =  4.24 g/L, 95% CI =  6.20 to  2.28, P<0.001), were associated with a significant increase in the severity of COVID 19 infection.
Conclusions: The incidence of liver injury seems to be higher in patients with severe COVID 19
infection. This finding could help physicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage."	0

20	COVID 19 has spread to most countries in the world. Puzzlingly, the impact of the disease is different in different countries. These differences are attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here we propose that national differences in COVID 19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID 19. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also found that BCG vaccination also reduced the number of reported COVID 19 cases in a country. The combination of reduced morbidity and mortality makes BCG vaccination a potential new tool in the fight against COVID 19.	0

24	The aim of our work was to better understand misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID 19 and to study the impact of these errors in epidemic curves. We examined publically available time series data of laboratory tests for SARS CoV 2 viral infection, the causal agent for COVID 19, to try to explore, using a Bayesian approach, about the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR based diagnostic test. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 3/28/2020) and city of Philadelphia, USA (available on 3/31/2020). Our analysis revealed that the data were compatible with near perfect specificity but it was challenging to gain information about sensitivity (prior and posterior largely overlapped). We applied these insights to uncertainty/bias analysis of epidemic curves into jurisdictions under the assumptions of both improving and degrading sensitivity. If the sensitivity improved from 60 to 95%, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within the 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in the shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60 70% range. In the extreme scenario, hundreds of undiagnosed cases, even among tested, are possible, potentially leading to further unchecked contagion should these cases not self isolate. The best way to better understand bias in the epidemic curves of COVID 19 due to errors in testing is to empirically evaluate misclassification of diagnosis in clinical settings and apply this knowledge to adjustment of epidemic curves, a task for which the Bayesian method we presented is well suited.	0
25	"Currently, COVID 19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has been widely spread around the world; nevertheless, so far there exist no specific antiviral drugs for treatment of the disease, which poses great challenge to control and contain the virus. Here, we reported a research finding that SARS CoV 2 invaded host cells via a novel route of CD147 spike protein (SP). SP bound to CD147, a receptor on the host cells, thereby mediating the viral invasion.
Our further research confirmed this finding. First, in vitro antiviral tests indicated Meplazumab, an anti CD147 humanized antibody, significantly inhibited the viruses from invading host cells, with an EC 50 of 24.86 μg/mL and IC 50 of 15.16 μg/mL. Second, we validated the interaction between CD147 and SP, with an affinity constant of 1.85×10  7 M. Co Immunoprecipitation and ELISA also confirmed the binding of the two proteins. Finally, the localization of CD147 and SP was observed in SARS CoV 2 infected Vero E6 cells by immuno electron microscope. Therefore, the discovery of the new route CD147 SP for SARS CoV 2 invading drugs."	0

27	Novel SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) has caused a pandemic condition world wide and has been declared as public health emergency of International concern by WHO in a very short span of time. The community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of China, Italy, Spain and USA among others. The prophylactic solution against SARS CoV 2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi epitope vaccine candidate against SARS CoV 2 with high antigenicity, safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non allergen and non toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID 19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi epitope vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS CoV 2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product. Thus, this present study provides an initial platform of the rapid generation of an efficacious protective vaccine for combating COVID 19.	0

31	The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) has triggered a global emergency, that demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent escalating health, social and economic impacts. The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells 1 . The S proteins from SARS CoV 1 and SARS CoV 2 are similar 2 , but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS CoV 1 specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS CoV 2 3 . Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS Cov2 with two completely conserved key functional features, an ion from COVID 2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.	0
32	This position paper discusses emerging behavioral, social, and economic dynamics related to the COVID 19 pandemic and puts particular emphasis on two emerging issues: First, delayed effects (or second strikes) of pandemics caused by dread risk effects are discussed whereby two factors which might influence the existence of such effects are identified, namely the accessibility of (mis )information and the effects of policy decisions on adaptive behavior. Second, the issue of individual preparedness to hazardous events is discussed. As events such as the COVID 19 pandemic unfolds complex behavioral patterns which are hard to predict, sophisticated models which account for behavioral, social, and economic dynamics are required to assess the effectivity and efficiency of decision making.	0

34	The COVID 19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2, has resulted in a global health and economic crisis of unprecedented scale. The high transmissibility of SARS CoV 2, combined with a lack of population immunity and prevalence of severe clinical outcomes, urges the rapid development of effective therapeutic countermeasures. Here, we report the generation of synthetic nanobodies, known as sybodies, against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS CoV 2. In an expeditious process taking only twelve working days, sybodies were selected entirely in vitro from three large combinatorial libraries, using ribosome and phage display. We obtained six strongly enriched sybody pools against the isolated RBD and identified 63 unique anti RBD sybodies which also interact in the context of the full length SARS CoV 2 spike protein. It is anticipated that compact binders such as these sybodies could feasibly be developed into an inhalable drug that can be used as a convenient prophylaxis against COVID 19. Moreover, generation of polyvalent antivirals, via fusion of anti RBD sybodies to additional small binders recognizing secondary epitopes, could enhance the therapeutic potential and guard against escape mutants. We present full sequence information and detailed protocols for the identified sybodies, as a freely accessible resource. This report will be updated as we further characterize the identified sybodies, in terms of affinities, scaled infections.	0
35	Wuhan coronavirus, called 2019 nCoV, is a newly emerged virus that infected more than 9692 people and leads to more than 213 fatalities by January 30, 2020. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. However, the viral protease of a coronavirus is well known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target. Fortunately, the sequence identity of the 2019 nCoV protease and that of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS CoV) is as high as 96.1%. We show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019 nCoV and SARS CoV are almost identical, which means all potential anti SARS CoV chemotherapies are also potential complex (GNC). The potential effectiveness of treating 2019 nCoV by using some existing HIV drugs is also analyzed.	1

37	COVID 19 elective orthopaedic surgery econonomics volume patient demand technology and innovation a b s t r a c t Background: The economic effects of the COVID 19 crisis are not like anything the U.S. health care system has ever experienced. Methods: As we begin to emerge from the peak of the COVID 19 pandemic, we need to plan the sustainable resumption of elective procedures. We must first ensure the safety of our patients and surgical staff. It must be a priority to monitor the availability of supplies for the continued care of patients suffering from COVID 19. As we resume elective orthopedic surgery and total joint arthroplasty, we must begin to reduce expenses by renegotiating vendor contracts, use ambulatory surgery centers and hospital outpatient departments in a safe and effective manner, adhere to strict evidence based and COVID 19eadjusted practices, and incorporate telemedicine and other technology platforms when feasible for health care systems and orthopedic groups to survive economically. Results: The return to normalcy will be slow and may be different than what we are accustomed to, but we must work together to plan a transition to a more sustainable health care reality which accommodates a COVID 19 world. Conclusion: Our goal should be using these lessons to achieve a healthy and successful 2021 fiscal year.	0

41	The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already occur. Aim: We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available. Methods: Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019 nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019 nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology. Results: The workflow reliably detects 2019 nCoV, and further discriminates 2019 nCoV from SARS CoV. Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses. Control material is made available through European Virus Archive  Global (EVAg), a European Union infrastructure project.

43	"The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China has rapidly propagated due to widespread person to person transmission and has resulted in over 1,133,758 cases in 197 countries with a total of 62,784 deaths as of April 5, 2020. Laboratory confirmation of SARS CoV 2 is performed with a virus specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) test. This test can take up to two days to complete, and, due to the possibility of false negatives, serial testing may be required to reliably exclude infection. A current supply shortage of RT PCR test kits compounds the shortcomings of entrusting diagnosis to the PCR test alone and underscores the urgent need to provide alternative methods for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS CoV 2 patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS CoV 2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value to fully exclude infection, because of the normal radiologic findings in some early disease patients. In this study, we use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history, and/or laboratory testing to more accurately and rapidly diagnose SARS CoV 2 ( ) patients. We included 905 RT PCR confirmed patients. 419 (46.2%) tested positive for SARS CoV 2 by laboratory confirmed realtime RT PCR assay and next generation sequencing, while 486 patients (53.8%) tested negative (confirmed by at least two additional negative RT PCR tests and clinical observation). The proposed AI system achieved an AUC of 0.92 and performed equally well in sensitivity compared to a senior thoracic radiologist on a testing set of 279 cases. The AI system also improved the detection of RT PCR positive SARS CoV 2 patients who presented with normal CTs, correctly identifying 17/25 (68%) patients, whereas all 25 RT PCR SARS CoV 2 positive CT normal patients were classified as SARS CoV 2 negative by radiologists.

44	We focused particularly on the epitopes in the S and N structural proteins due to their dominant and long lasting immune response previously reported against SARS CoV. For the identified T cell epitopes, we additionally incorporated the information about the associated MHC alleles to provide a list of epitopes that seek to maximize population coverage globally, as well as in China. To further expand the search and identify potentially effective T cell targets covering a higher percentage of the population, we next additionally considered the set of T cell epitopes that have been experimentally determined from positive MHC binding assays (Table 1), but, unlike the previous epitope set, their ability to induce a T cell response against SARS CoV was not experimentally determined. We also computed the population coverage of this specific set of epitopes in China, the country most affected by the COVID 19 outbreak, which was estimated to be slightly lower (88.11%), as certain MHC alleles (e.g., HLA A*02:01) associated with some 3).	0

52	Background: The discovery of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) during a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan city (China) has raised a global public health concern, as the city consists of around 11 million people and is considered a major transport and logistics hub. This deadly virus caused the world to be in high alert as the death toll and the number of confirmed cases is continuously rising since the first case was reported. The Chinese government warned that the transmission ability of the virus is increasing, and international efforts are needed to overcome this outbreak. The purpose of this review is to focus on the published articles about the new virus, which will give an insight into the current state of research and data available, as well as recommending future studies. Methods: For this narrative review, more than 20 relevant scientific articles and reports were considered from various databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct) using keywords such as Coronavirus Outbreak, COVID 19, Emerging Epidemics, Emerging Infections, and Novel Coronavirus. Results: The results from this review show that the situation is rapidly evolving, as human to human transmission is occurring, and the number of new cases and mortalities is increasing by the day and on a global level. There is still ambiguity about mutation risks and how the virus spreads as the source was not yet identified. Major gaps in knowledge about the origin of the virus, epidemiology and transmission impose a future.	0

By means of a monoclonal immunoradiometric assay for calcitonin precursors, we have measured serum concentrations of procalcitonin in patients with various bacterial and viral infections.
79 children (newborn to age 12 years) in hospital with suspected infections were investigated prospectively. 19 patients with severe bacterial infections had very high serum concentrations of procalcitonin at diagnosis (range 6 53 ng/mL) in comparison with 21 children found to have no signs of infection (baseline concentrations <0&middot;1 ng/mL). Serum procalcitonin values decreased rapidly during antibiotic therapy. 11 patients with peripheral bacterial colonisation or local infections without invasive sepsis and 18 (86%) of 21 patients with viral infections had concentrations within or slightly above the normal range (0&middot;1 1 & m i d d o t ; 5 ng/mL). Among 9 severely burned patients studied in an intensive care unit, the post traumatic course of procalcitonin concentrations (range 0&middot;1 120 ng/mL) was closely related to infectious complications and acute septic episodes. Concentrations of mature calcitonin were normal in all subjects, whatever procalcitonin concentrations were found.
Concentrations of a substance immunologically identical to procalcitonin are raised during septic conditions. Serum concentrations seem to be correlated with the severity of microbial invasion."	0
55	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is a newly emerged infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) and has been pandemic all over the world. This study described acute kidney injury (AKI) at early stage of COVID 19 and its clinical significance. Three hundred and fifty five COVID 19 patients with were recruited and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patient's prognosis was tracked and risk factors of AKI was analyzed. Of 355 COVID 19 patients, common, severe and critical ill cases accounted for 63.1%, 16.9% and 20.0%, respectively. On admission, 56 (15.8%) patients were with AKI. Although AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID 19, there was no significant association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID 19 patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among COVID 19 patients. Among 56 COVID 19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Fatality rate was obviously higher among COVID  19 patients with AKI than those without AKI (RR=7.08, P<0.001). In conclusion, male elderly COVID 19 patients with diabetes are more susceptible to AKI. AKI at early stage may be a negative prognostic indicator for COVID 19.	0

Objectives To query the international spinal cord medicine community's engagement with and response to the novel coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic and to assess pandemic specific information needs and patient concerns. Setting An international collaboration of authors and participants. Methods Two near identical surveys (one English and one Spanish language) were distributed via the internet. Responses from those questions shared between the surveys were pooled then analyzed; four questions' responses (those not shared) were analyzed separately. Results A total of 783 responses were submitted from six continents. Few participants (5.8%) had tested their outpatients with SCI/D for COVID 19; only 4.4% reported having a patient with SCI/D with the virus. Of respondents who worked at an inpatient facility, 53.3% reported that only individuals with symptoms were being screened and 29.9% said that no screening was occurring. Participants relayed several concerns offered by their patients with SCI/D, including vulnerability to infection (76.9%) and fragility of caretaker supply (42%), and those living in countries with guaranteed health care were more likely to report widespread availability of COVID 19 testing than were those living in countries without universal care, χ 2 (3, N = 625) = 46.259, p < 0.001. Conclusion There is substantial variability in the rehabilitation medicine community in COVID 19 screening practices and availability of screening kits. People living with SCI/D are expressing legitimate and real concerns about their vulnerability to COVID 19. More and rapid work is needed to address these concerns and to standardize best practice protocols throughout the rehabilitation community. 1234567890();,:

59	"AIM: To investigate the characteristics and clinical value of chest computed tomography (CT) images of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data and CT images of 80 cases of NCP were collected. The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results of the patients were analysed. The lesions in each lung segment of the patient's chest CT images were characterised. Lesions were scored according to length and diffusivity.
RESULTS: The main clinical manifestations were fever, dry cough, fatigue, a little white sputum, or diarrhoea. A total of 1,702 scored lesions were found in the first chest CT images of 80 patients. The lesions were located mainly in the subpleural area of the lungs (92.4%). Most of the lesions were ground glass opacity, and subsequent fusions could increase in range and spread mainly in the subpleural area. Pulmonary consolidation accounted for 44.1% of all of the lesions. Of the 80 cases, 76 patients (95%) had bilateral lung disease, four (5%) patients had unilateral lung disease, and eight (10%) patients had cord shadow.
CONCLUSION: The chest CT of NCP patients is characterised by the onset of bilateral groundglass lesions located in the subpleural area of the lung, and progressive lesions that result in consolidation with no migratory lesions. Pleural effusions and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are rare. As patients can have inflammatory changes in the lungs alongside a negative early nucleic acid test, chest CT, in combination with epidemiological and laboratory tests, is a useful examination to evaluate the disease and curative effect."	0

61	"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus named 2019 coronavirus (2019 nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan of China and spread to several countries worldwide within just one month.
Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in some patients with 2019 nCoV. In a short period of time, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), have been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019 nCoV, which is the same for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). To investigate the possible cause of kidney damage in 2019 nCoV patients, we used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and an independent unpublished kidney single cell RNA Seq data generated in house to evaluate ACE2 gene expressions in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders.
Our results showed the enriched expression of all subtypes of proximal tubule cells of kidney and low but detectable levels of expression in bladder epithelial cells. These results indicated the urinary system is a potential route for 2019 nCoV infection, along with the respiratory system and digestion system. Our findings suggested the kidney abnormalities of SARS and 2019 nCoV patients may be due to proximal tubule cells damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury.

62	"The coronavirus SARS CoV 2 uses an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for the replication of its genome and the transcription of its genes. Here we present the cryo electron microscopic structure of the SARS CoV 2 RdRp in its replicating form. The structure comprises the viral proteins nsp12, nsp8, and nsp7, and over two turns of RNA template product duplex. The active site cleft of nsp12 binds the first turn of RNA and mediates RdRp activity with conserved residues. Two copies of nsp8 bind to opposite sides of the cleft and position the RNA duplex as it exits. Long helical extensions in nsp8 protrude along exiting RNA, forming positively charged 'sliding poles' that may enable processive replication of the long coronavirus genome. Our results will allow for a detailed analysis of the inhibitory mechanisms used by antivirals such as remdesivir, which is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19).

64	The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV2). We have performed an integrated sequence based analysis of SARS CoV2 genomes from different geographical locations in order to identify its unique features absent in SARS CoV and other related coronavirus family genomes, conferring unique infection, facilitation of transmission, virulence and immunogenic features to the virus. The phylogeny of the genomes yields some interesting results. Systematic gene level mutational analysis of the genomes has enabled us to identify several unique features of the SARS CoV2 genome, which includes a unique mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein (A930V (24351C>T)) in the Indian SARS CoV2, absent in other strains studied here. We have also predicted the impact of the mutations in the spike glycoprotein function and stability, using computational approach. To gain further insights into host responses to viral infection, we predict that antiviral host miRNAs may be controlling the viral pathogenesis. Our analysis reveals nine host miRNAs which can potentially target SARS CoV2 genes. Interestingly, the nine miRNAs do not have targets in SARS and MERS genomes. Also, hsa miR 27b is the only unique miRNA which has a target gene in the Indian SARS CoV2 genome. We also predicted immune epitopes in the genomes	0

67	In this study, the problem of automatically classifying pulmonary diseases, including the recently emerged COVID 19, from X Ray images, is considered. While the spread of COVID 19 is increased, new, automatic, and reliable methods for accurate detection are essential to reduce the exposure of the medical experts to the outbreak. X Ray imaging, although limited to specific visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high dimensional features from medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state of the art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task. A large scale dataset of 3905 X Ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve remarkable results in related tasks. The results suggest that training CNNs from scratch may reveal vital biomarkers related but not limited to the COVID 19 disease, while an overall classification accuracy of the seven classes reaches 87.66%. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID 19.	0
68	Coronavirus (COVID 19) outbreak in late 2019 and 2020 comprises a serious and more likely a pandemic threat worldwide. Given that the disease has not approved vaccines or drugs up to now, any efforts for drug design and or clinical trails of old drugs based on their mechanism of action are worthy and creditable in such circumstances. Experienced docking experiments using the newly released coordinate structure for COVID 19 protease as a receptor and thoughtfully selected chemicals among antiviral and antibiotics drugs as ligands may be leading in this context. We selected nine drugs from HIV 1 protease inhibitors and twenty one candidates from anti bronchitis drugs based on their chemical structures and enrolled them in blind and active site directed dockings in different modes and in native like conditions of interactions. Our findings suggest the binding capacity and the inhibitory potency of candidates are as follows TipranavirIndinavirAtazanavirDarunavirRitonavirAmprenavir for HIV 1 protease inhibitors and CefditorenCefiximeErythromycinClarithromycin for anti bronchitis medicines. The drugs bioavailability, their hydrophobicity and the hydrophobic properties of their binding sites and also the rates of their metabolisms and deactivations in the human body are the next determinants for their overall effects on viral infections, the net results that should survey by clinical trials to assess their therapeutic usefulness for coronavirus infections.	0

Throughout the response to the COVID19 crisis, many healthcare institutions have increased their use of telecommunications. From medical schools to residency programs, from patient interactions at home to those in quarantine, virtual communication is providing a safe way to continue with our responsibilities during this pandemic. According to POTUS (17 March 2020), telemedicine, with lessened HIPAA regulations, is now an approved method of communication between physicians and patients for those with Medicare. 1 Telemedicine provides protection to both the physician and patient, preventing possible spread of COVID 19 while allowing for continued patient care. It is now vital to make practical, effective use of telecommunications to stabilize the healthcare system. Recently, medical schools have transferred their curriculum to continue online. With the AAMC recommending a ""temporary suspension of medical students' participation in any activities that involve patient(s)"" virtual education allows for continued development, while still adhering to social distancing. 2,3 Web conferencing has features such as audio video, screen sharing, large login capacities and chat functions, allowing students and educators to maintain their regular teaching schedule. 3 The use of telecommunications is indispensable to disseminate knowledge and scientific updates and to swiftly overcome the disruptions in scientific conferences and meetings. Telecommunication and virtual learning can provide medical education and training for those with adjusted or challenging schedules due to the demands of the pandemic. 3,4 Virtual learning not only can be but should be utilized for morning report, sign out, M&M, and communicating with staff in high risk areas without fear of increasing risk of COVID 19 exposure. Social distancing does not need to be at the expense of effective communication, which itself is fundamental to address this crisis efficiently and effectively.

70	"After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections. Recently, a new emerged HCoV isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). This virus causes acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as ""coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID 19). The emergence of SARS CoV 2 and of SARS CoV caused widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security. There are some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses. The goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms."	1
71	"Background It has been reported that several cases recovered from COVID 19 tested positive for SARS CoV 2 after discharge (re detectable positive, RP), however the clinical characteristics, significance and potential cause of RP patients remained elusive.
Methods A total of 262 COVID 19 patients were discharged from January 23 to February 25, 2020, and were enrolled for analysis of their clinical parameters. The RP and non RP (NRP) patients were grouped according to the disease severity during their hospitalization period. The clinical characterization at re admission to the hospital was analyzed. SARS CoV 2 RNA and plasma antibody levels were detected using high sensitive detection methods.
Findings Up to March 10, 2020, all of patients were followed up for at least 14 days, and 38/262 of RP patients (14.5%) were present. The RP patients were characterized by being less than 14 years old and having mild and moderate conditions as compared to NRP patients, while no severe patients became RP.
Retrospectively, the RP patients displayed fewer symptoms, more sustained remission of CT imaging and earlier RNA negative conversion but similar plasma antibody levels during their hospitalization period as compared to those NRP patients. When re admitted to the hospital, these RP patients showed no obvious clinical symptoms or disease progression indicated by normal or improving CT imaging and inflammatory cytokine levels. All 21 close contacts of RP patients were tested negative for SARS CoV 2 RNA, and no suspicious clinical symptoms were reported. However, 18/24 of RNA negative samples detected by the commercial kit were tested to be positive for virus RNA using a hyper sensitive method, suggesting the carrier status of virus possibly existed in patients recovered from COVID 19.
Interpretation Our results showed that young and mild COVID 19 patients seem to be RP patients after discharge, who show no obviously clinical symptoms and disease progression upon re admission.

72	"While lymphocytopenia is a common characteristic of patients infected by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2), the mechanisms responsible for this depletion are unclear. Through careful inspection of the spleens and lymph nodes (LNs) from six cases with postmortem examinations, we observed that SARS CoV 2 could directly infect secondary lymphoid organs to induce cell death. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), the potential receptor of SARS CoV 2, expresses on tissue resident CD169   macrophages in spleens and LNs. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) can be found in ACE2   cells, CD169   macrophages, but not in CD3   T cells or B220   B cells in spleens and LNs. SARS CoV 2 infection induces severe tissue damage including lymph follicle depletion, splenic nodule atrophy, histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reductions.
Moreover, in situ TUNEL staining illustrated that viral infection leads to severe lymphocyte apoptosis, which might be mediated by viral antigens inducing Fas upregulation. Furthermore, SARS CoV 2 also triggers macrophages to produce IL 6, a proinflammatory cytokine that directly promotes lymphocyte necrosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SARS CoV 2 directly neutralizes human spleens and LNs through infecting tissue resident CD169   macrophages."	0
73	Diagnosis of 2019 nCoV was determined according to the following three methods: isolation of 2019 nCoV or at least two positive results by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) assay for 2019 nCoV or a genetic sequence that matches 2019 nCoV. Finally, a total of 118 consecutive laboratory confirmed 2019 nCoV patients (60 females, 58 males; mean age, 44.06 years ± 13.62 [SD]; median age, 42.5 years; age range, 2 75 years), who underwent serial CT scans, were included.	1
74	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is a positive single stranded RNA virus that causes a highly contagious Corona Virus Disease (COVID19). Entry of SARS CoV 2 in human cells depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptor Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and on S protein priming by host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. Recently COVID19 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization yet high differences in disease outcomes across countries have been seen. We provide evidences based on analyses of existing public datasets and by using various insilico approaches to explain some of these as factors that may explain population level differences. One of the key factors might be entry of virus in host cells due to differential interaction of viral proteins with host cell proteins due to different genetic backgrounds. Based on our findings, we conclude that higher expression of ACE2 facilitated by natural variations, acting as Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and with different frequencies in different populations, results in ACE2 homo dimerization which is disadvantageous for TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2 and becomes more difficult in presence of broad neutral amino acid transporter, B0AT1 (coded by SLC6A19), that usually does not express in Lungs. We also propose that the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS CoV 2 S Protein vis a vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, eQTLs in TMPRSS2 and natural structural variations in the gene may also result in differential outcomes towards priming of viral S protein, a critical step for entry of Virus in host cells. In addition, we suggest some other potential key host genes like ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA, BTF3 and some other proteases as Cathepsins, that might have a critical role. Understanding these population specific differences may help in developing appropriate management strategies.	0

76	"The newly identified SARS CoV 2 has now been reported from around 183 countries with more than a million confirmed human cases including more than 68000 deaths. The genomes of SARS COV 2 strains isolated from different parts of the world are now available and the unique features of constituent genes and proteins have gotten substantial attention recently.
Spike glycoprotein is widely considered as a possible target to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. We analyzed 320 whole genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of SARS CoV 2 using multiple sequence alignment tools. In this study, 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes including 25 nonsynonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike protein of SARS CoV 2. Among the 26 variations detected, 12 variations were located at the N terminal domain and 6 variations at the receptor binding domain (RBD) which might alter the interaction with receptor molecules. In addition, 22 amino acid insertions were identified in the spike protein of SARS CoV 2 in comparison with that of SARS CoV. Phylogenetic analyses of spike protein revealed that Bat coronavirus have a close evolutionary relationship with circulating SARS CoV 2. The genetic variation analysis data presented in this study can help a better understanding of SARS CoV 2 pathogenesis. Based on our findings, potential inhibitors can be designed and tested targeting these proposed sites of variation."	0
77	"Contact tracing apps are one of the primary technology facilitated COVID responses currently proposed. In the majority of Western nations there is the expectation that citizens will have the autonomy to decide whether or not to install a COVID related app. Yet, the more users who install a COVID app, the greater the impact on public health.

Specifically, we enumerate user tradeoffs related to data collection, data quality, identifier/data encryption, privacy invasion, mobile costs, user agency, benefits from app use, and app transparency. We break down which tradeoffs are relevant for which contact tracing implementations (centralized vs. decentralized, location vs. proximity based).

79	The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the COVID 19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human to human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019 nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409e7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128e1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588e13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th e 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.	0

Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood based method (ML), exponential growth rate based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible Infected Removed dynamic model based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers.
Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days.
The controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most regions of China, but is still larger than one in Hubei Province. Sustained efforts are needed to further reduce epidemic."	0

83	Introduction: Several antiretroviral drugs are being considered for the treatment of COVID 19, the disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus, (SARS CoV 2). We systematically reviewed the clinical outcomes of using antiretroviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of coronaviruses and planned clinical trials. Methods: Three databases were screened from inception to 30 March 2020 for studies reporting clinical outcomes of patients with SARS, MERS or COVID 19 treated with antiretrovirals. Results: From an initial screen of 433 titles, two randomized trials and 24 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of antiretroviral drugs; most studies reported outcomes using LPV/r as treatment. Of the 21 observational studies reporting treatment outcomes, there were three studies among patients with SARS, six studies among patients with MERS and 12 studies among patients with COVID 19. In one randomized trial 99 patients with severe COVID 19 illness were randomized to receive LPV/r (400/100 mg twice a day) and 100 patients to standard of care for 14 days: LPV/r was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement, although LPV/r given within 12 days of symptoms was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement; 28 day mortality was numerically lower in the LPV/r group (14/99) compared to the control group (25/100), but this difference was not statistically significant. The second trial found no benefit. The certainty of the evidence for the randomized trials was low. In the observational studies 3 out of 361 patients who received LPV/r died; the certainty of evidence was very low. Three studies reported a possible protective effect of LPV/r as post exposure prophylaxis. Again, the certainty of the evidence was very low due to uncertainty due to limited sample size. Conclusions: On the basis of the available evidence it is uncertain whether LPV/r and other antiretrovirals improve clinical outcomes or prevent infection among patients at high risk of acquiring COVID 19.	0

Some of these proteins, such as the RNA dependent RNA polymers, helicase and main protease, are well conserved between SARS CoV 2 and the original SARS virus, but several others are not. This study examines one of the most novel proteins encoded by SARS CoV 2, a macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). Although 26% of the amino acids in this SARS CoV 2 macrodomain differ from those seen in other coronaviruses, the protein retains the ability to bind ADP ribose, which is an important characteristic of beta coronaviruses, and potential therapeutic target.

88	"Background: Since December 2019, an outbreak of the Corona Virus disease 2019 (COVID 19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV 2)
in Wuhan, China, has become a public health emergency of international concern. The high fatality of aged cases caused by SARS CoV 2 was a need to explore the possible age related phenomena with non human primate models.
Methods: Three 3 5 years old and two 15 years old rhesus macaques were intratracheally infected with SARS CoV 2, and then analyzed by clinical signs, viral replication, chest X ray, histopathological changes and immune response.
Results: Viral replication of nasopharyngeal swabs, anal swabs and lung in old monkeys was more active than that in young monkeys for 14 days after SARS CoV 2 challenge. Monkeys developed typical interstitial pneumonia characterized by thickened alveolar septum accompanied with inflammation and edema, notably, old monkeys exhibited diffuse severe interstitial pneumonia. Viral antigens were detected mainly in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages.
Conclusion: SARS CoV 2 caused more severe interstitial pneumonia in old monkeys than 2"	0
89	This study explores the divergence pattern of SARS CoV 2 using whole genome sequences of the isolates from various COVID 19 affected countries. The phylogenomic analysis indicates the presence of at least four distinct groups of the SARS CoV 2 genomes. The emergent groups have been found to be associated with signature structural changes in specific proteins. Also, this study reveals the differential levels of divergence patterns for the protein coding regions. Moreover, we have predicted the impact of structural changes on a couple of important viral proteins via structural modelling techniques. understanding of SARS CoV 2 pathogenesis enabling better mitigation of this pandemic situation.	1
90	"The known: COVID 19 has been diagnosed in over 4,000 Australians. Up until mid March, most were from international travel, but now we are seeing a rise in locally acquired cases.
This study uses a simple transmission dynamic model to demonstrate the difference between moderate changes to the reproduction number and forcing the reproduction number below one.
Background: Around the world there are examples of both effective control (e.g., South Korea, Japan) and less successful control (e.g., Italy, Spain, United States) of COVID 19 with dramatic differences in the consequent epidemic curves. Models agree that flattening the curve without controlling the epidemic completely is insufficient and will lead to an overwhelmed health service. A recent model, calibrated for the UK and US, demonstrated this starkly.
Methods: We used a simple compartmental deterministic model of COVID 19 transmission in Australia, to illustrate the dynamics resulting from shifting or flattening the curve versus completely squashing it.
Results: We find that when the reproduction number is close to one, a small decrease in transmission leads to a large reduction in burden (i.e., cases, deaths and hospitalisations), but achieving this early in the epidemic through social immunity."	0
91	Coronavirus is an enveloped virus with positive sense single stranded RNA. Coronavirus infection in humans mainly affects the upper respiratory tract and to a lesser extent the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical symptoms of coronavirus infections can range from relatively mild (similar to the common cold) to severe (bronchitis, pneumonia, and renal involvement). The disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) was called Covid 19 by the World Health Organization in February 2020. Face to face communication and consistent exposure to body fluids such as blood and saliva predispose dental care workers at serious risk for 2019 nCoV infection. As demonstrated by the recent coronavirus outbreak, information is not enough. During dental practice, blood and saliva can be scattered. Accordingly, dental practice can be a potential risk for dental staff, and there is a high risk of cross infection. This article addresses all information collected to date on the virus, in accordance with the guidelines of international health care institutions, and provides a comprehensive protocol coronavirus.	0

Purpose: Published literature regarding calf nutrition was reviewed to create an information base for the implementation of proper nutritional management to maximize health and productivity.
Sources: The main source of data and information for this review was peer reviewed literature.
Synthesis: Feeding a sufficient volume of colostrum during the first hours of life is crucial to calf health and survival; however, less is known about transition milk feeding and the potential benefits of the myriad of bioactive compounds it contains. After feeding colostrum and transition milk, calves are susceptible to diarrhea when moved onto high amounts of milk, and antibiotic use is often necessary to decrease disease. Feeding an elevated plane of milk nutrition results in increased ADG and, in some studies, increased future milk production. Thus, this nutritional strategy is recommended; however, weaning calves from high volumes of milk represents massive changes in the structure and microbiology of the gastrointestinal tract.
Conclusions and Applications: Colostrum and transition milk contain an abundance of bioactive molecules that can positively affect gut development and microbiota. There is significant potential for the use of novel feeding strategies and microbial based products as alternatives to antibiotics. Calves fed an elevated plane of nutrition in the first month of life have greater productivity and growth. However, weaning should take place later in life. Moreover, applying a proper step down feeding protocol is recommended, as it allows calves to intake weaning."	0

95	"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is a rapidly escalating epidemic caused by SARS CoV 2. Identification of a simple and effective indicator to assess disease severity and prognosis is urgently needed.
Dynamic changes of blood lymphocyte percentage (LYM%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of COVID 19 patients were retrospectively analyzed. A Time LYM% model (TLM) was established according to the descriptive studies and was validated in 92 hospitalized cases.
Results from death and severe cases showed that LYM% in blood tests were inversely associated with the severity and prognosis of COVID 19. LYM% in moderate type of patients with COVID 19 remained higher than 20% 10 12 days after symptom onset. In contrast, LYM% was lower than 20% in severe cases. However, LYM% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17 19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. Accordingly, we established a Time LYM% model (TLM), which was validated as an independent criterion of disease classification in another 92 hospitalized patients with COVID 19.
Lymphopenia can be used as an indicator of disease severity and prognosis of COVID 19 patients. TLM is worth of application in the clinical practice."	0

The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 25, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infection periods and the fatality rate.
First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infected human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (April 19, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day : medRxiv preprint R 0 = 3 initially, 1.38 at day 22 and 0.64 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is almost 14000 casualties, with 2.4 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of
casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic. We plan to perform again these calculations and publish a short note when the epidemic is over and the complete and precise data is available.
Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, the importance to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the isolation."	0

99	Background: Corona Virus Disease 2019 due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We aimed to compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for patients with COVID 19 with LPV/r only. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (age ≥18years) with laboratory confirmed COVID 19 without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020. Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group for 5 21 days. The primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID 19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day7). Results: We analyzed 16 patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group, and both initiated after diagnosis. Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups. The SARS CoV 2 could not be detected for 12(75%) of 16 patients' nasopharyngeal specimens in the combination group after seven days, compared with 6 (35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group ( p < 0 ·05). After 14 days, 15 (94%) of 16 and 9 (52 ·9%) of 17, respectively, SARS CoV 2 could not be detected ( p < 0 ·05). The chest CT scans were improving for 11(69%) of 16 patients in the combination group after seven days, compared with 5(29%) of 17 in the monotherapy group ( p < 0 ·05). Conclusion: In patients with COVID 19, the apparent favorable clinical response with arbidol and LPV/r supports further LPV/r only.	0
100	"Background: COVID 19 is still becoming an increasing global threat to public health. More detailed and specific characteristics of COVID 19 are needed to better understand this disease. Additionally, durations of COVID 19, e.g., the average time from exposure to recovery, which is of great value in understanding this disease, has not been reported so far.
Aims: To give the information on clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID 19 and to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration.
In this retrospective study, we enrolled 77 patients (mean age: 52±20 years; 44.2% males) with laboratory confirmed COVID 19 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital during 21 st Jan and 8 th February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data on admission were collected; complications and outcomes were followed up until 29 th February 2020. The study's endpoint was the discharge within two weeks. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify risk factors for longer hospitalization duration.
Of 77 patients, there are 34 (44.2%) males, 24 (31.2%) with comorbidities, 22 (28.6%) lymphopenia, 20 (26.0%) categorized as severe patients, and 28 (36.4%) occurred complications. By the end of follow up, 64 (83.1%) patients were discharged home after being tested negative for SARS CoV 2 infections, 8 remained in hospital and 5 died. 36 (46.8%) patients were discharged within 14 days and thus reached the study endpoint, including 34 (59.6%) of 57 non severe patients and 2 (10%) of 20 severe patients. The overall cumulative probability of the endpoint was 48.3%. Hospital length of stay and duration of exposure to discharge for 64 discharged patients were 13 (10 16.5) and 23 (18 24.5) days, respectively. Multivariable stepwise Cox regression model showed bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter time from the illness onset to admission, severity of disease and lymphopenia were independently associated with longer hospitalized duration.
Conclusions: COVID 19 has significantly shorter duration of disease and hospital length of stay than SARS. Bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter period of illness onset to admission, lymphopenia, severity of disease are the risk factors for longer hospitalization duration of COVID 19."	0
101	"Respiratory infections may spread through droplets, airborne particles, and aerosols from infected individuals through coughing, sneezing, and speaking. In the case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19), droplet spread can occur from symptomatic as well as presymptomatic and asymptomatic persons. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has therefore recently recommended home made cloth face coverings for use by the general public in areas of significant community based transmission. Because medical masks and N95 respirators are in short supply, these are to be reserved for healthcare workers. There is, however, little information on the effectiveness of home made face coverings in reducing droplet dissemination. Here, we ascertained the performance of ten different fabrics, ranging from cotton to silk, in blocking high velocity droplets, using a 3 layered commercial medical mask as a benchmark material. We also assessed their breathability and ability to soak water. We reason that the materials should be as breathable as possible, without compromising blocking efficiency, to reduce air flow through the sides of the mask since such flow would defeat the purpose of the mask. We found that most home fabrics substantially block droplets, even as a single layer. With two layers, blocking performance can reach that of surgical mask without significantly compromising breathability. Furthermore, we observed that home fabrics are hydrophilic to varying degrees, and hence soak water. In contrast, medical masks are hydrophobic, and tend to repel water. Incoming droplets are thus soaked and ""held back"" by home fabrics, which might offer an as of yet untapped and understudied advantage of homemade cloth masks. Overall, our study suggests that most double layered cloth face coverings may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections.

102	As the outbreak reached its peak on February 29, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) had encouraged the people to practice social distancing, and although the number of new cases decreased sharply afterward, smaller outbreaks of mass infections continued, and the KCDC accordingly announced a more aggressive social distancing campaign from March 22 [2]. While two online surveys of 1,000 South Koreans in late February and late March released by the KCDC revealed that 75.4% and 88.7% of respondents, respectively, refrained from using public transport, it is not clear whether such high levels of risk perception are representative of the extent to which the general public actually practiced social distancing [4].	1

We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government' public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. Except for slightly lower compliance among young adults, all subgroups we studied understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS Cov 2 virus. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government , or think the government has been untruthful about the crisis believe the messaging and claim to be acting in accordance.

Among them, many service operations, which require customers to travel and visit a place indoor, become almost infeasible to run in a crowded city like Hong Kong. Motivated by a recent reported real case on an innovative service operation in Hong Kong, we build analytical models to explore how logistics and technologies together can transform the ""static service operations"" to become the ""bring service near your home"" mobile service operations. We also highlight how the government may provide the subsidy to support the above mentioned mobile service operation (MSO) to make it financially viable. We specifically show that the government may adopt the fixed costsubsidy (FCS) scheme, operations cost subsidy (OCS) scheme or safety technology support (STS) scheme to help. We further uncover that the OCS scheme would bring a larger consumer surplus than the FCS scheme and is hence more preferable. In the extended models, we first study the case when service fee cannot be changed because of corona virus outbreak (CVO). We then explore the feasibility of adopting MSO in the long run as a financially self sustainable service operation and derive the analytical conditions under which MSO is a win win business model for both the service provider and consumers. Finally, we study the optimal safety technology investment problem.

Therefore, it seems that new policies are still needed to overcome mistrust in Iran at times of emergency. Developing a policy on donation management was the first step, and there are several factors that could have contributed to the perception of the mistrust and failure in emergency missions.

116	Infectious diseases are acknowledged as one of the most critical threats to global public health today. Climate change, unprecedented population growth with accelerated rates of antimicrobial resistance, have resulted in both the emergence of novel pathogenic organisms and the re emergence of infections that were once controlled. The consequences have led to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases globally. The ability to rapidly monitor the spread of diseases is key for prevention, intervention and control, however several limitations exist for current surveillance systems and the capacity to cope with the rapid population growth and environmental changes. Wastewater Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a new epidemiology tool that has potential to act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. WBE postulates that through the analysis of population pooled wastewater, infectious disease and resistance spread, the emergence of new disease outbreak to the community level can be monitored comprehensively and in real time. This manuscript provides critical overview of current infectious disease surveillance status, as well as it introduces WBE and its recent advancements. It also provides recommendations for further development required for WBE application as an effective tool for infectious disease surveillance.	0
117	"Objective. Countries presently apply different strategies to control the COVID 19 outbreak. Differences in population structures, decision making, health systems and numerous other factors result in various trajectories in terms of mortality at country scale. Our objective in this manuscript is to disentangle the future of second line European countries (i.e. countries that present, today, a moderate death rate) with respect to the current COVID 19 wave.
Method. We propose a data driven approach, grounded on a mixture model, to forecast the dynamics of the number of deaths from COVID 19 in a given focal country using data from countries that are ahead in time in terms of COVID 19 induced mortality. In this approach, the mortality curves of ahead in time countries are used to build predictors, which are then used as the components of the mixture model. This approach was applied to eight second line European countries (
In general, the second line European countries tend to follow relatively mild mortality curves (typically, those of Switzerland and Hubei) rather than fast and severe ones (typically, those of Spain, Italy, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom). From a methodological viewpoint, the performance of our forecasting approach is about 80% up to 8 days in the future, as soon as the focal country has accumulated at least two hundreds of deaths.
Discussion. Our results suggest that the continuation of the current COVID 19 wave across Europe will likely be mitigated, and not as strong as it was in most of the front line countries first impacted by the wave."	0

São Paulo is the epicenter of the epidemic in Brazil. Brazilian university hospitals  centers for professional training and qualification, as well as knowledge production  have a major role in combating this epidemic.
Coronaviruses belong to a large family of viruses and, for 60 years, have been a known cause of respiratory infection in humans and animals. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as responsible for the flu syndrome and severe pulmonary complications, the COVID 19. Its origin, still uncertain, is probably related to a mutation in the coronavirus that infects bats, breaking the genetic barrier to adapt to a new species. The original site of transmission was a seafood and live animal market in the city of Wuhan, China. The first cases were linked to individuals who frequented this market. Later, the virus infected family members and, in geometrical progression, nearby provinces, expanding to several countries in all continents. 1,2
The virus is highly contagious through droplets and contact. Estimates indicate that an infected person can transmit the virus to two to four people. 1 The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), found in the lower respiratory tract of humans, has been identified as a cellular receptor for SARS CoV 2 and plays an important role in the pathogenesis and spread of the virus. The S glycoprotein on the surface of the coronavirus can bind to the ACE2 receptor on the surface of cells, especially lung cells, rich in ACE2 receptors. The ribonucleic acid (RNA) of the viral genome is released inside the cell, starting the encoding of structural and accessory proteins, with subsequent release of new viruses. This process results in the release of cytokines with intense inflammatory response, leading to respiratory failure, shock, and thromboembolic phenomena related to disseminated intravascular coagulation. 3, 4 Children probably develop milder and oligosymptomatic clinical presentations because the maturity and binding ability of ACE2 might be lower in this population than in adults. This is concerning from an epidemiological perspective, since children can be important reservoirs, becoming sources of infection. 4 The incubation period is, on average, five days, ranging from two to 14 days. Most adults or children infected with SARS CoV 2 present flu syndrome (90%) with mild symptoms, but some individuals, especially older adults and those with comorbidities, such as cardiovascular or lung diseases, diabetes, and hypertension, might progress to severe conditions: respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, and death. The fatality rate is 2 to 5%. 2 Although children can acquire the infection, they usually have a good prognosis and rarely present complications. 4 No country is prepared to face the COVID 19 epidemic, which imposes substantial negative impacts on the economy, medical care, and mental health of the society as a whole. Brazil, particularly São Paulo, which declared a state of emergency, has implemented adequate preventive measures in accordance with the epidemiological scenario. 5 Rigorous social distancing of the population is crucial, in addition to educational campaigns for hygiene and the proper use of masks. Social distancing measures should be constantly evaluated because if they are lifted before the appropriate moment, that is, before the end of community transmission, we will have a new wave and growth in cases of infection.

121	"Amid the COVID 19 pandemic, a nationwide lockdown is imposed in India initially for three weeks from 24 th March to 14 th April, 2020 and extended up to 3 rd May, 2020. Due to the forced restrictions, pollution level in cities across the country drastically slowed down just within few days which magnetize discussions regarding lockdown to be the effectual alternative measures to be implemented for controlling air pollution. The present article eventually worked on this direction to look upon the air quality scenario amidst the lockdown period scientifically with special reference to the megacity Delhi. With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant parameters (PM 10 , PM 2.5 , SO 2 , NO 2 , CO, O 3 and NH 3 ) for 34 monitoring stations spread over the megacity we have employed National Air Quality Index (NAQI) to show the spatial pattern of air quality in pre and during lockdown phases. The results demonstrated that during lockdown air quality is significantly improved. Among the selected pollutants, concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2.5 have witnessed maximum reduction (>50%) in compare to the pre lockdown phase. In compare to the last year (i.e. 2019) during the said time period the reduction of PM 10 and PM 2.5 is as high as about 60% and 39% respectively. Among other pollutants, NO 2 ( 52.68%) and CO ( Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 2 30.35%) level have also reduced during lockdown phase. About 40% to 50% improvement in air quality is identified just after four days of commencing lockdown. About 54%, 49%, 43%, 37% and 31% reduction in NAQI have been observed in Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern parts of the megacity. Overall, the study is thought to be a useful supplement to the regulatory bodies since it showed the pollution source control can attenuate the air quality.

124	In view of the shortage of current FFP 2 respirator masks, and therefore the lack of personal protective equipment for clinical staff, we aimed to explore ways of bottom up solutions to allow hospitals to fabricate respirator masks that (i) fulfill FFP 2 criteria, (ii) are rapid and easy to produce to enable sufficient local production, and (iii) are constructed from materials that are routinely available in hospitals worldwide. In our investigation, particular surgical isolation and wrapping material fulfilled these criteria. With 3 layers of this material, a filter efficiency of 94% for 0.3 µm particles, 99% for 0.5 µm particles, and 100% for 3.0 µm particles was obtained. After sterilization the filter efficiency allowed re use as a FFP 1 respirator mask. This knowledge can contribute to global health, in any country and/or hospital that may not have access to otherwise commercial solutions.	1
125	A new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID 19 virus is the etiological agent responsible 31 for the 2019 2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan 1 4 . Currently there 32 is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to 33 rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined 34 structure assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high throughput screening to 35 identify new drug leads that target the COVID 19 virus main protease (M pro ). M pro is a key 36 CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, 37 making it an attractive drug target for this virus 5,6 . Here, we identified a mechanism based 38 inhibitor, N3, by computer aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal 39 structure of COVID 19 virus M pro in complex with this compound. Next, through a 40 combination of structure based virtual and high throughput screening, we assayed over 41 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other 42 pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of M pro . Six of these inhibit M pro with 43 IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 μM. Ebselen also exhibited promising antiviral 44 activity in cell based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, 45 which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to 46 new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available. 47 48 author/funder.

The COVID 19 virus genome is comprised of ~30,000 51 nucleotides; its replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, 52 required for viral replication and transcription 3,4 . The functional polypeptides are released 53 from the polyproteins by extensive proteolytic processing, predominantly by a 33.8 kDa 54 main protease (M pro ), also referred to as the 3C like protease. M pro digests the polyprotein 55 at no less than 11 conserved sites, starting with the autolytic cleavage of this enzyme itself 56 from pp1a and pp1ab 8 . The functional importance of M pro in the viral life cycle, together 57 with the absence of closely related homologues in humans, identify the M pro as an attractive 58 target for antiviral drug design 9 . 59 To facilitate the rapid discovery of antiviral compounds with clinical potential, we 60 developed a strategy combining structure assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and 61 high throughput screening to repurpose existing drugs to target COVID 19 virus M pro . 62 Establishing a high throughput activity assay 63 Recombinant COVID 19 virus M pro with native N and C termini was expressed in 64 Escherichia coli and subsequently purified (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). The molecular 65 weight of COVID 19 virus M pro as determined by mass spectroscopy is 33797.0 Da, 66 consistent with its theoretical molecular weight 33796.8 Da. In order to characterize its 67 enzymatic activity and to carry out high throughput screening of inhibitors, we developed 68 a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay.

126	Objectifs : La pandémie de la maladie à coronavirus (COVID 19) a provoqué une crise sanitaire majeure et mis en quarantaine la moitié de la population planétaire. En France, elle a provoqué une réorganisation en urgence de l'offre de soins mobilisant les soignants dans un climat d'incertitude. L'objectif du présent article est de faire le point sur les risques associés à l'exposition des soignants au COVID 19 pour leur santé mentale. Méthodes : Les auteurs ont conduit une revue de la littérature internationale tenant compte des données des précédentes épidémies (SARS CoV 1, H1N1) et des données plus récentes concernant le COVID 19. Résultats : Les caractéristiques de cette pandémie (rapidité de diffusion, connaissances incertaines, sévérité, morts de soignants) ont installé un climat anxiogène. Des facteurs organisationnels peuvent être source de stress : déficit d'équipement de protection individuel, réaffectation de postes, manque de communication, manque de matériels de soins, bouleversement de la vie quotidienne familiale et sociale. D'autres facteurs de risque sont identifiés comme l'absence de soutien, la crainte de contaminer un proche, l'isolement ou la stigmatisation sociale, le haut niveau de stress au travail, ou les patterns d'attachement insécure. Les soignants ont ainsi un risque augmenté d'anxiété, de dépression, d'épuisement, d'addiction et de trouble de stress post traumatique. Conclusions : Cette crise sanitaire devrait nous aider à mieux comprendre la vulnérabilité des soignants à la souffrance psychologique afin de renforcer les stratégies de prévention primaire et la formation aux enjeux psychologiques des soins, de la relation, et de la gestion des situations de crises sanitaires.	0
127	"The damage of the novel Coronavirus disease is reaching unprecedented scales. There are numerous classical epidemiology models trying to quantify epidemiology metrics. Usually, to forecast the epidemics, these classical approaches need parameter estimations, such as the contagion rate or the basic reproduction number. Here, we propose a data driven, parameter free approach to access the fragility and systemic risk of epidemic networks by studying the Forman Ricci curvature. Network curvature has been used successfully to forecast risk in financial networks and we suggest that those results can be translated for COVID 19 epidemic time series as well. We first show that our hypothesis is true in a toy model of epidemic time series with delays, which generates epidemic networks. By doing so, we are able to verify that the Forman Ricci curvature can be a parameter free estimate for the fragility and risk of the network at each stage of the simulated pandemic. On this basis, we then compute the Forman Ricci curvature for real epidemic networks built from epidemic time series available from the World Health Organization (WHO). The Forman Ricci curvature allow us to detect early warning signs of the emergence of the pandemic. The advantage of the method lies in providing an early geometrical data marker for epidemics, without the need of parameter estimation and stochastic modeling. The strategy above, together with other data driven tools for investigating epidemic network dynamics, can be readily implemented on a daily basis to quickly estimate the growth, risk and fragility of real COVID 19 epidemic networks at different scales. * f.nobregasantos@amsterdamumc.nl

128	"Background Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19). Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID 19.
We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID 19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.
Findings Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R 0 of 1·5, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R 0 was 2·5 or 3·5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R 0 of 1·5 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R 0 of 2·5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R 0 of 3·5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R 0 was 1·5. For R 0 values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.
Interpretation In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID 19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts."	0
129	Early detection of infection with SARS CoV 2 is key to managing the current global pandemic, as evidence shows the virus is most contagious on or before symptom onset 1,2 . Here, we introduce a low cost, high throughput method for diagnosis of SARS CoV 2 infection, dubbed Pathogen Oriented Low Cost Assembly & Re Sequencing (POLAR), that enhances sensitivity by aiming to amplify the entire SARS CoV 2 genome rather than targeting particular viral loci, as in typical RT PCR assays. To achieve this goal, we combine a SARS CoV 2 enrichment method developed by the ARTIC Network (https://artic.network/) with short read DNA sequencing and de novo genome assembly. We are able to reliably (>95% accuracy) detect SARS CoV 2 at concentrations of 84 genome equivalents per milliliter, better than the reported limits of detection of almost all diagnostic methods currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. At higher concentrations, we are able to reliably assemble the SARS CoV 2 genome in the sample, often with no gaps and perfect accuracy. Such genome assemblies enable the spread of the disease to be analyzed much more effectively than would be possible with an ordinary yes/no diagnostic, and can help identify vaccine and drug targets. Using POLAR, a single person can process 192 samples over the course of an 8 hour experiment, at a cost of ~$30/patient, enabling a 24 hour turnaround with sequencing and data analysis time included.	1

132	"During the past three months, a new coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) epidemic has been growing exponentially, affecting over 100 thousand people worldwide, and causing enormous distress to economies and societies of affected countries. A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published, in scientific journals as well as through non peer reviewed channels, to investigate SARS CoV 2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination. We examined all full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies. Our analysis clearly shows severe limitations in the present data, in light of which any finding should be considered, at the very best, preliminary and hypothesis generating. Hence the need for avoiding stigmatization based on partial information, and for continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of the sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.

133	"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is spreading all over the world. Medical imaging such as X ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID 19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID 19. For example, AI empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delination of infections in X ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID 19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow up.
We particularly focus on the integration of AI with X ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the frontline hospitals, in order to depict 19."	0

The daily confirmed cases of COVID 19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval.
We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4 1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub exponential growth dynamics of COVID 19.

148	The novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) has been declared to be a new international health emergence and no specific drug has been yet identified. Several methods are currently being evaluated such as protease and glycosylated spike (S) protein inhibitors, that outlines the main fusion site among coronavirus and host cells. Notwithstanding, the Heptad Repeat 1 (HR1) domain on the glycosylated spike (S) protein is the region with less mutability and then the most encouraging target for new inhibitors drugs. The novelty of the proposed approach, compared to others, lies in a precise training of a deep neural network toward the 2019 nCoV virus. Where a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) has been trained to distingue the whole 2019 nCoV protein sequence amongst two different viruses family such as HIV 1 and Ebola. In this way, the present deep learning system has precise knowledge of peptide linkage among 2019 nCoV protein structure and differently, of other works, is not trivially trained on public datasets that have not been provided any ligand peptide information for 2019 nCoV. Suddenly, the SNN shows a sensitivity of 83% of peptide affinity classification, where 3027 peptides on SATPdb bank have been tested towards the specific region HR1 of 2019 nCoV exhibiting an affinity of 93% for the peptidylprolyl cis trans isomerase (PPIase) peptide. This affinity between PPIase and HR1 can open new horizons of research since several scientific papers have already shown that CsA immunosuppression drug, a main inhibitor of PPIase, suppress the reproduction of different CoV virus included SARS CoV and MERS CoV.

151	Background The COVID 19 pandemia due to the SARS CoV 2 coronavirus, in its first 4 months since its outbreak, has to date reached more than 200 countries worldwide with more than 2 million confirmed cases (probably a much higher number of infected), and almost 200,000 deaths. Amplification of viral RNA by (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT PCR) is the current gold standard test for confirmation of infection, although it presents known shortcomings: long turnaround times (3 4 hours to generate results), potential shortage of reagents, false negative rates as large as 15 20%, the need for certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained personnel. Thus there is a need for alternative, faster, less expensive and more accessible tests. Material and methods We developed two machine learning classification models using hematochemical values from routine blood exams (namely: white blood cells counts, and the platelets, CRP, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, LDH plasma levels) drawn from 279 patients who, after being admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) emergency room with COVID available a Web based tool for clinical reference and evaluation 1 .	0

154	"One of the reasons for the fast spread of SARS CoV 2 is the lack of accuracy in detection tools in the clinical field. Molecular techniques, such as quantitative real time RT PCR and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. For this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. In addition, SARS CoV 2 is remarkably similar to other Coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. To tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. The proposed approach employs a state of the art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus.
Experiments on data from the Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) show that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify SARS CoV 2, distinguishing it from other coronavirus strains, such as MERS CoV, HCoV NL63, HCoV OC43, HCoV 229E, HCoV HKU1, and SARS CoV regardless of missing information and errors in sequencing (noise). From a dataset of 553 complete genome non repeated sequences that vary from 1,260 to 31,029 bps in length, the proposed approach classifies the different coronaviruses with an average ac : bioRxiv preprint curacy of 98.75% in a 10 fold cross validation, identifying SARS CoV 2 with an AUC of 98%, specificity of 0.9939 and sensitivity of 1.00 in a binary classification. Then, using the same basis, we classify SARS CoV 2 from 384 complete viral genome sequences with human host, that contain the gene ORF1ab from the NCBI with a 10 fold accuracy of 98.17% , a specificity of 0.9797 and sensitivity of 1.00. Furthermore, an in depth analysis of the results allow us to identify base pairs sequences that are unique to SARS CoV 2 and do not appear in other virus strains, that could then be used as a base for designing new primers and examined by experts to extract further insights. These preliminary results seem encouraging enough to identify deep learning as a promising research venue to develop assisted detection tests for SARS CoV 2. At this end the interaction between viromics and deep learning, will hopefully help to solve global infection problems. In addition, we offer our code and processed data to be used for diagnostic purposes by medical doctors, virologists and scientists involved in solving the SARS CoV 2 pandemic. As more data become available we will update our system."	0

157	The pace of algorithm development for discovering epitopes and designing vaccines has recently accelerated, due to renewed interest in epitope based vaccines generated by the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors to the field of oncology (1) and the emergence of new pathogens such as nCOV 2019 (SARS CoV 2). In other iVAX toolkit advances, to be described here, we explored the HLA restricted or “personal” nature of immune response to novel antigens and developed specific tools to address these types of evaluations, called iTEM (individualized T cell epitope measure) and EpiCC (epitope content comparison), respectively. Additional tools that have been integrated into the website since 2015 include JanusMatrix, a specially tailored homology analysis tool that examines pathogen/host sequence similarity at the MHC:TCR interface for any given peptide, and predicts potentially cross conserved epitopes, allowing candidate sequences with potential host cross conservation (at the TCR face) to be preferentially excluded from vaccine constructs, and iTEM, which enables the analysis of an individual's immune responses to vaccine antigens according to their HLA haplotype. Taken collectively, the nine HLA Class II supertype alleles, along with their respective family members, cover well over 95% of most HLA types present in human population groups (20), and the six supertype alleles, along with their respective family members, cover over 98% of the human population groups including East Asian populations (21). In retrospective studies, we determined that peptide epitopes that have homologs in the human proteome that have compatible, but not exactly matched, MHC binding anchors and exactly matched TCR that have enhanced immunogenicity at an accelerated pace are possible and encouraged.	0

160	"infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) with multiple organ injuries. The aim of this study was to analyze SARS CoV 2 induced acute liver injury (ALI), its association with death risk and prognosis after discharge.
Methods: Three hundred and fifty five COVID 19 patients were recruited. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. ALI was evaluated and its prognosis was tracked. The association between ALI and death risk was analyzed.
Results: Of 355 COVID 19 patients, 211 were common, 88 severe, and 51 critical ill cases, respectively. On admission, 223 (62.8%) patients were with hypoproteinemia, 151(42.5%) with cholestasis, and 101 (28.5%) with hepatocellular injury. As expected, ALI was more common in critical ill patients. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and lymphocyte reduction were three important independent risk factors predicting ALI among COVID 19 patients. Death risk analysis shows that fatality rate was higher among patients with hypoproteinemia than those without hypoproteinemia (RR=9.471, P<0.001). Moreover, fatality rate was higher among patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (RR=2.182, P<0.05).
Follow up observation found that more than one hepatic functional indexes of two third patients remained abnormal 14 days after discharge.
Conclusions: ALI at early stage elevates death risk of COVID 19 patients.
SARS CoV 2 induced ALI has not recovered completely 14 days after discharge."	0
161	"Since its emergence in December 2019, COVID 19 has rapidly developed into a pandemic with many countries declaring emergency conditions to contain its spread. The impact of the disease, while has been relatively low in the Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) so far, is expected to be devastating given the less developed and fragmented health care system in the continent. In addition, most emergency measures such as border closings, cancellations of inbound flights, social distancing, and promotion of hand hygiene may not be as effective due to the clustered way people live in large as well as smaller population centers. As SSA waits for the start of large epidemics as seem in other regions, there exist acute need for estimates of the potential impacts of the disease once it gets strong hold in the region. To address this need, we developed a mathematical model with key parameters obtained from recent studies, to estimate the number of infections with in the first 90 days of the transmission under 54 scenarios of population sizes, initial number of cases, and coverage of contact tracing and isolation. Our results show that if implemented early, 80% contact tracing may ""flattens the curve"" of local epidemics, brings the pandemic to a manageable level for all population sizes we assessed.

The healthcare impact of the epidemic in India was studied using a stochastic mathematical model. Methods: A compartmental SEIR model was developed, in which the flow of individuals through compartments is modeled using a set of differential equations. Different scenarios were modeled with 1000 runs of Monte Carlo simulation each using MATLAB. Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) requirements, and deaths were modeled on SimVoi software. The impact of nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) including social distancing and lockdown on checking the epidemic was estimated. Results: Uninterrupted epidemic in India would have resulted in more than 364 million cases and 1.56 million deaths with peak by mid July. As per the model, at current growth rate of 1.15, India is likely to reach approximately 3 million cases by 25 May, implying 125,455 (±18,034) hospitalizations, 26,130 (±3298) ICU admissions, and 13,447 (±1819) deaths. This would overwhelm India's healthcare system. The model shows that with immediate institution of NPIs, the epidemic might still be checked by mid April 2020. It would then result in 241,974 (±33,735) total infections, 10,214 (±1649) hospitalizations, 2121 (±334) ICU admissions, and 1081 (±169) deaths.
Conclusion: At the current growth rate of epidemic, India's healthcare resources will be overwhelmed by the end of May. With the immediate institution of NPIs, total cases, hospitalizations, ICU requirements, and deaths can be reduced by almost 90%."	0

165	This technical report describes a dynamic causal model of the spread of coronavirus through a population. The model is based upon ensemble or population dynamics that generate outcomes, like new cases and deaths over time. The purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends predictions of relevant outcomes. By assuming suitable conditional dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social distancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages state of the art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological populations to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the model per se can be optimised given timeseries data. Although the purpose of this paper is to describe a modelling protocol, the results illustrate some interesting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear effects of herd immunity that speak to a self organised mitigation process.	0

167	Quarantine conditions arising as a result of the coronavirus (COVID 19) have had a significant impact on global production rates and supply chains. This has coincided with increased demands for medical and personal protective equipment such as face shields. Shortages have been particularly prevalent in western countries which typically rely upon global supply chains to obtain these types of device from low cost economies. National calls for the repurposing of domestic mass production facilities have the potential to meet medical requirements in coming weeks, however the immediate demand associated with the virus has led to the mobilisation of a diverse distributed workforce. Selection of appropriate manufacturing processes and underused supply chains is paramount to the success of these operations. A simplified medical face shield design is presented which repurposes an assortment of existing alternative supply chains. The device is easy to produce with minimal equipment and training. It is hoped that the methodology and approach presented is of use to the wider community at this critical time.	0

173	"As the current SARS CoV 2 pandemic spreads, the need for more diagnostic capabilities is great. In order to address this need, we have developed a highly sensitive RT LAMP assay compatible with current reagents, that utilizes a colorimetric readout in as little as 30 minutes. In addition to this, we have developed an inexpensive pipeline to further increase sensitivity without requiring highly specialized equipment. A rapid inactivation protocol capable of inactivating virions, as well as endogenous nucleases, was also developed to increase sensitivity and sample stability. This protocol, combined with our RT LAMP assay, has a sensitivity of at least 50 viral RNA copies per microliter in a sample. To further increase the sensitivity, a purification protocol compatible with this inactivation method was developed. The inactivation and purification protocol, combined with our RT LAMP assay, brings the sensitivity to at least 1 viral RNA copy per microliter in a sample. We hope that this inactivation and purification pipeline, which costs approximately $0.07 per sample and which uses readily available reagents, will increase the availability of SARS CoV 2 testing, as well as expand the settings in which this testing can be performed.
The current SARS CoV 2 pandemic has had and will continue to have an enormous impact on society worldwide, threatening the lives and livelihoods of many. As the disease spreads, the need for rapid point of care diagnostic tools has become immense. Many efforts are currently underway to develop such an assay that can be easily used in a variety of settings 1 . The ideal assay would require no specialized equipment and would have a rapid and easily read result. To that end, we have developed an assay based upon the reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT LAMP) technique. To boost sensitivity, we also developed a novel sample preparation method that can be used as the first step for many different types of downstream assays. The protocol is simple, inexpensive, and rapid. It utilizes reagents that are readily prepared in large quantities.
LAMP is a method of isothermal DNA replication that utilizes, in an accelerated format, six DNA oligos that hybridize with eight different regions of a target molecule 2 . Utilizing a strand displacing polymerase and loops formed during this reaction, a fast amplification reaction can occur upon proper oligo binding to the desired target. Such reactions are capable of generating microgram quantities of DNA in a very short period of time at a single reaction temperature. Furthermore, although the stranddisplacing polymerase has reverse transcriptase activity, a reverse transcriptase can be included to improve sensitivity within the reaction when detecting an RNA target (RT LAMP), such as the SARS CoV 2 RNA. LAMP assays have a variety of readouts due to the large amount of DNA generated, including fluorescence using an intercalating DNA dye, turbidity, or by a drop in the pH if the reaction is minimally buffered 1, 3, 4 . This change in pH, sufficient to cause a pH indicator dye to visibly change color, is the most applicable method for a point of care LAMP based diagnostic."	0

175	Die anhaltende COVID 19 Pandemie wird sich voraussichtlich zu einem beispiellosen Stresstest für Gesundheitssysteme weltweit entwickeln. Vor dem Hintergrund des sich entwickelnden Ausbruchsgeschehens in der Schweiz schildern wir exemplarisch in diesem Bericht, welche Herausforderungen und Maßnahmen wir in unserer radioonkologischen Klinik identifiziert haben, um Risiken zu mindern, den weiteren Betrieb während des Ausbruchs mit gleich hoher Effektivität sicherzustellen und eine Belastung anderer Ressourcen im Gesundheitssystem zu vermeiden. Ende Dezember 2019 wurde in China ein neuartiges Corona virus (SARSCoV2, vormals als 2019nCoV bezeichnet) als Ursache für atypische Pneumonien mit potenziell letalem Ver lauf identifiziert, die als CoronavirusKrankheit 2019 (CO VID19) bezeichnet werden [1]. Nach der raschen weltweiten Verbreitung wurde der Virusausbruch am 11. März 2020 von der Welt gesundheitsorganisation (WHO) als Pandemie einge stuft, die betroffene Gesundheitssysteme belastet und mögli cherweise zu deren Zusammenbruch bei unkontrollierter und rasanter Verbreitung führen kann. Bedeutung der Pandemie für Krebspatienten und die Radioonkologie Auf den ersten Blick scheint die Radioonkologie keine Diszi plin zu sein, die von einem Virusausbruch stark betroffen wäre. Viel mehr besteht die Gefahr, dass die internistischen Disziplinen, vor allem die Intensivmedizin und die Notfallaufnahmen, von einer großen Anzahl von Patienten überfordert werden. Bei genauerer Betrachtung der Arbeitsabläufe in der Radioonkolo gie sind jedoch potenzielle Schwachstellen erkennbar, die einen kritischen Einfluss auf die Funktionsfähigkeit einer Abteilung in einer Krisensituation haben können, wie dies bereits beim Ausbruch des schweren akuten respiratorischen Syndroms (SARS) im Jahr 2003 zu beobachten war [2]. Es ist zu berück sichtigen, dass Patientinnen und Patienten sowie Behandelnde vor, während und nach einer radioonkologischen Therapie gleich mit mehreren Dilemmata konfrontiert sind: ▶ Zum einen ist es dringend erforderlich, dass eine der klini schen Situation angemessene Strahlendosis in sinnvoller Zeit appliziert wird  gemeint ist also eine ausreichend hohe bio logisch wirksame Dosis bei kurativen wie palliativen Konzep ten mit dauerhafter Tumor oder Symptomkontrolle ohne nennenswerte Zunahme der langanhaltenden Toxizität; zum anderen soll eine Kontaminationsgefahr  und damit Kon takte  so gering wie möglich gehalten werden. ▶ Darüber hinaus müssen noch sorgfältiger als sonst denkbare therapeutische Alternativen überdacht werden, die jedoch zu keiner erhöhten Belastung des in die Pandemie direkt ein gebundenen Personals führen: aufwendige Operationen mit Nachbeatmungen und längerer Belegung von Intensivplätzen kommen daher als Alternative einer mehrwöchigen Strahlen therapie (RT) mit vergleichbaren onkologischen Ergebnissen schwerlich in Frage.	0

Objective: To describe clinical, and imaging findings including the evolution pattern in COVID 19 pneumonia complicated by pulmonary embolism (PE).
Eleven of 1453 patients with a probable diagnosis of COVID 19 pneumonia were retrospectively selected for the presence of PE. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded. All cross sectional CT imaging was qualitatively scored for the first 28 days after onset of symptoms.
Of 24 patients underwent CTA PE, 11 were confirmed with PE. All 11 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The pulmonary emboli were most common in segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries. We observed an evolution pattern of predominant findings with ground glass opacities (GGO) to GGO with crazy paving in 3 patients, then to consolidation with linear densities, or to reticulation in 9 patients. Lung cysts or traction bronchiectasis could be seen from day 5 to 9 after symptoms and reticulation, subpleural curvilinear lines were more common from day 20.

Sera were obtained near the onset of RI and 3 to 4 weeks later as part of a prospective study of 200 subjects evaluated for RI from 2009 to 2013. Antibodies against common HCoV strains were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization assay comparing older adults with cardiopulmonary diseases (99 subjects) to younger, healthy adults (101 subjects). Virus shedding was detected in respiratory secretions by polymerase chain reaction. Of 43
HCoV associated illnesses, 15 (35%) occurred in 14 older adults (aged ≥60 years) and 28 (65%) in 28 younger adults (aged 21 40 years). Binding and neutralizing antibodies were higher in older adults. Only 16 (35.7%) of RI with increases in binding antibodies also had increases in neutralizing antibodies to HCoV. Increases in binding antibodies with RI were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and virus shedding, and more frequent in younger compared to older adults. Functional neutralizing antibodies were not stimulated as often as binding antibodies, explaining in part a susceptibility to reinfection with HCoV. Monitoring binding antibodies may be more sensitive for the serologic detection of HCoV infections.

181	"Background: The degree of myocardial injury, reflected by troponin elevation, and associated outcomes among hospitalized patients with Coronavirus Disease in the US are unknown.
Objectives: To describe the degree of myocardial injury and associated outcomes in a large hospitalized cohort with laboratory confirmed COVID 19.
Patients with COVID 19 admitted to one of five Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York City between February 27th and April 12th, 2020 with troponin I (normal value <0.03ng/mL) measured within 24 hours of admission were included (n=2,736). Demographics, medical history, admission labs, and outcomes were captured from the hospitals' EHR.
The median age was 66.4 years, with 59.6% men. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, was more prevalent in patients with higher troponin concentrations, as were hypertension and diabetes. A total of 506 (18.5%) patients died during hospitalization. Even small amounts of myocardial injury (e.g. troponin I 0.03 0.09ng/mL, n=455, 16.6%) were associated with death (adjusted HR: 1.77, 95% CI 1.39 2.26; P<0.001) while greater amounts (e.g. troponin I>0.09 ng/dL, n=530, 19.4%) were associated with more pronounced risk (adjusted HR 3.23, 95% CI 2.59 4.02).
Conclusions: Myocardial injury is prevalent among patients hospitalized with COVID 19, and is associated with higher risk of mortality. Patients with CVD are more likely to have myocardial injury than patients without CVD. Troponin elevation likely reflects non ischemic or secondary myocardial injury.
Unstructured Abstract (100/100 words): Myocardial injury reflected as elevated troponin in Coronavirus Disease (COVID 19) is not well characterized among patients in the United States. We describe the prevalence and impact of myocardial injury among hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID 19 and troponin I measurements within 24 hours of admission (N=2,736). Elevated troponin concentrations (normal <0.03ng/mL) were commonly observed in patients hospitalized with COVID 19, most often present at low levels, and associated with increased risk of death. Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or risk factors for CVD were more likely to have myocardial injury. Troponin elevation likely reflects non ischemic or secondary myocardial injury."	0

184	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is the cause of coronavirus disease that has resulted in a global pandemic. It is a highly contagious positive strand RNA virus and its clinical presentation includes severe to critical respiratory disease that appears to be fatal in ~3 5% of the cases. The viral spike (S) coat protein engages the human angiotensin converting enzyme2 (ACE2) cell surface protein to invade the host cell. The SARS CoV 2 S protein has acquired mutations that increase its affinity to human ACE2 by ~10 15 fold compared to SARS CoV S protein, making it highly infectious. In this study, we assessed if ACE2 polymorphisms might alter host susceptibility to SARS CoV 2 by affecting the ACE2 Sprotein interaction. Our comprehensive analysis of several large genomic datasets that included over 290,000 samples representing >400 population groups identified multiple ACE2 protein altering variants, some of which mapped to the S protein interacting ACE2 surface. Using recently reported structural data and a recent S proteininteracting synthetic mutant map of ACE2, we have identified natural ACE2 variants that are predicted to alter the virus host interaction and thereby potentially alter host susceptibility. In particular, human ACE2 variants S19P, I21V, E23K, K26R, T27A, N64K, T92I, Q102P and H378R are predicted to increase susceptibility. The T92I variant, part of a consensus NxS/T N glycosylation motif, confirmed the role of N90 glycosylation in immunity from non human CoVs. Other ACE2 variants K31R, N33I, H34R, E35K, E37K, D38V, Y50F, N51S, M62V, K68E, F72V, Y83H, G326E, G352V, D355N, Q388L and D509Y are putative protective variants predicted to show decreased binding to SARS CoV 2 S protein. Overall, ACE2 variants are rare, consistent with the lack of selection pressure given the recent history of SARS CoV epidemics, however, are likely to play an important role in altering susceptibility to CoVs.

185	In the last few months, the novel COVID 19 pandemic has spread all over the world. Due to its easy transmission, developing techniques to accurately and easily identify the presence of COVID 19 and distinguish it from other forms of flus and pneumonia is crucial. Recent research has shown that the chest X rays of patients suffering from COVID 19 depicts certain abnormalities in the radiography. However, those approaches are closed source and not made available to the research community for re producibility and gaining a deeper insight. The goal of this work is to build open source and open access datasets and present an accurate Convolutional Neural Network framework for differentiating COVID 19 cases from other pneumonia cases. Our work utilizes state of the art training techniques including progressive resizing, cyclical learning rate finding and discriminative learning rates to training fast and accurate residual neural networks. Using these techniques, we showed state of the art results on the open access COVID 19 dataset. This work presents a 3 step technique to fine tune a pre trained ResNet 50 architecture to improve model performance and reduce training timewe call it COVID ResNet. This is achieved through progressively resizing of input images to 128x128x3, 224x224x3, and 229x229x3 pixels and fine tuning the network at each stage. This approach along with the automatic learning rate selection enabled us to achieve state of the accuracy of 96.23% (on all the classes) on the COVIDx dataset with only 41 epochs. This work presented a computationally efficient and highly accurate model for multi class classification of three different infection types from along with Normal individuals. This model can help in early screening of COVID 19 cases and help reduce burden on healthcare systems.	0

188	Prepping is a practice of anticipating and adaptating to impending conditions of calamity, ranging from lowlevel crises to extinction level events. The 2020 COVID 19 pandemic, which preppers consider a 'mid level' event, and which many of them were well prepared for, makes clear that scholarly attention to prepper's motivations and methods is both timely and valuable. Drawing from a three year ethnographic research project with preppers, this paper traces the activity of a single bunker builder who has constructed a technically sophisticated private underground community. Supplemented by additional fieldwork, the paper argues that the boltholes preppers are building in closed communities built to survive the collapse of society, order, and even the environment itself, refract the seemingly irresolvable problems we are failing to address as a species. In the prepper ideology, faith in adaptation has supplanted hope of mitigation, making contemporary bunkers more speculative than reactionary and more temporal than spatial. The bunkers preppers build are an ark to cross through a likely (but often unspecified) catastrophe; they are a chrysalis from which to be reborn  7185/	0

190	The global spread of the 2019 nCoV is continuing and is fast moving, as indicated by the WHO raising the risk assessment to high. In this article, we provide a preliminary phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis of this new virus. A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using the 29 available whole genome sequences of 2019 nCoV and two whole genome sequences that are highly similar sequences from Bat SARS like Coronavirus available in GeneBank. We are able to clarify the mechanism of transmission among the countries which have provided the 2019 nCoV sequence isolates from their patients. The Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that the 2019 2020 nCoV most probably originated from the Bat SARS like Coronavirus circulating in the Rhinolophus bat family. In agreement with epidemiological observations, the most likely geographic origin of the new outbreak was the city of Wuhan, China, where 2019 nCoV time of the most recent common ancestor emerged, according to molecular clock analysis, around November 25 th , 2019. These results, together with previously recorded epidemics, suggest a recurring pattern of periodical epizootic outbreaks due to Betacoronavirus.

192	However, further studies later revealed that there were no widespread infections found in wild or farmed civets and clinical symptoms of SARS were only shown to be overt in the civets sold at the markets [9,10], suggesting that civets were highly unlikely to have been the primary/natural reservoir host. The lower number of female patients, as observed in this particular group of patients, could potentially be attributed to their natural immune system protection from X chromosomes and sex hormones (see Figure 5A) [13], which are known to play a key role in innate and adaptive immunity [24] and thus less susceptible to various infections. However, according to structural analysis of the spike (S) protein in SARS CoV 2, the S protein shows that it can only form weak bonds to the ACE2 receptors in human cells, suggesting that the virus may not transmit readily between human hosts, reducing its contagiousness and reproduction number [28].	1
193	The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 started in China and devastated a vast majority of countries. In India, COVID 19 cases are steadily increasing since January 30, 2020, and the government imposed lockdown across the country to curtail community transmission. COVID 19 forecasts have played an important role in capturing the probability of infection and the basic reproduction rate. In this study, we predicted some trajectories of trajectories associated with COVID 19 in the coming days in India using an Autoregression integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and Richard's model. By the end of April 2020, the incidence of new cases is predicted to be 5200 (95% CI: 4650 to 6002) through the ARIMA model versus be 6378 (95% CI: 4904 to 7851) Richard model. We estimated that there would be a total of 197 (95% CI: 118 to 277) deaths and drop down in the recovery rates will reach around 501 (95% CI: 245 to 758) by the end of April 2020. These estimates can help to strengthen the implementation of strategies to increase the health system capacity and enactment of social distancing measures all over India.	0
194	We leveraged the largely untapped resource of electronic health record data to address critical clinical and epidemiological questions about Coronavirus Disease 2019 . To do this, we formed an international consortium (4CE) of 96 hospitals across 5 countries (www.covidclinical.net). Contributors utilized the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) or Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) platforms to map to a common data model. The group focused on comorbidities and temporal changes in key laboratory test values. Harmonized data were analyzed locally and converted to a shared aggregate form for rapid analysis and visualization of regional differences and global commonalities. Data covered 27,584 COVID 19 cases with 187,802 laboratory tests. Case counts and laboratory trajectories were concordant with existing literature. Laboratory tests at the time of diagnosis showed hospital level differences equivalent to country level variation across the consortium partners. Despite the limitations of decentralized data generation, we established a framework to capture the interventions.	0

Question: Are men more susceptible to getting and dying from Findings: In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women. In the public data set, the percentage of men were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group, although age was comparable between men and women.
Meaning: Male gender is a risk factor for worse outcome in patients with COVID independent of age and susceptibility.
Importance: The recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) Disease has put the world on alert, that is reminiscent of the SARS outbreak seventeen years ago.
Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID 19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID 19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID 19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (≥65 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID 19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P<0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs.
4.9, P<0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID 19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID 19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015).

This study examined the impact of health education on healthcare seeking behavior of migrant workers in China and explored the differences in different health education methods. This paper used the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS) to analyze the relationship between health education and healthcare seeking behavior. Our results indicated that health education could significantly improve the healthcare seeking behavior of migrant workers, but there was still ample space for improvement. From the perspective of different health education methods, lectures, public consultation, and online education were positively correlated to healthcare seeking behavior, while publicity materials and bulletin boards were not. Although the effects of publicity materials and bulletins were limited, these two health education methods were still the most widely used. Our results emphasized the necessity of increasing investment in lectures, public consultation, online education, and other similar health education methods. This change in health education methods can play an effective role in the spread of health education to improve the healthcare seeking behavior of migrant workers."	0

(which was not certified by peer review) and underwent LU, a short clinical assessment by 2 emergency physicians blinded to each other's and a CT . LU consisted of scoring lesions in 8 chest zones from 0 to 3, defining a severity global score (GS) ranging from 0 to 24. CT severity score ranged from 0 to 3 according to the extent of interstitial pneumonia signs. 48 patients underwent LU by both an expert and a newly trained physician.
Findings : The GS showed good performance to predict CT severity assessment of COVID 19 as normal versus pathologic: AUC=0.93, maximal Youden index 1 with 95% sensitivity, and 83% specificity. Similar performance was found for CT assessment as normal or minimal versus moderate or severe (n=90): AUC 0.89, maximal Youden index 7 with 86% sensitivity, and 78% specificity.
Good agreement was found for zone scoring assessed by new trainee (30mn theory   30mn practice) and expert (n=14,14*8 checkpoints), weighted kappa 0.85 1; moderate agreement was found for new trainee (n=48, 30mn theory) and expert, kappa 0.62 0.81.
Interpretation : GS score is a simple tool to assess lung damage severity in patients with suspected or diagnosed COVID 19. Comparing the performance of new trainees and expert physicians opens a path for adoption beyond the scope of experts. LU is a good candidate for patients triage, especially in case of CT availability issues."	0

One possibility is that certain N acyl amino acid bioactivities require interactions within the cell (e.g., binding to mitochondria to stimulate respiratory uncoupling) whereas others involve extracellular interactions (e.g., engaging cell surface receptors), suggesting that certain compartmentalized pools of N acyl amino acids might be more relevant for specific bioactivities.	0

207	In the context of the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic, several reports and studies have attempted to model and predict the spread of the disease. There is also intense debate about policies for limiting the damage, both to health and to the economy.

On the other hand, we cannot ignore the potential for long term economic damage caused by strict nation wide lockdowns. In this working paper, we present a quantitative way to compute lockdown decisions for individual cities or regions, while balancing health and economic considerations. Furthermore, these policies are learnt automatically by the proposed algorithm, as a function of disease parameters (infectiousness, gestation period, duration	1

210	Hypertension is a diverse illness interlinked with cerebral, cardiovascular (CVS) and renal abnormalities. Presently, the malady is being treated by focusing on Renin angiotensin system (RAS), voltage gated calcium channels, peripheral vasodilators, renal and sympathetic nervous systems. Cardiovascular and renal abnormalities are associated with the overactivation of RAS, which can be constrained by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II (Ang II)  AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. The latter is a new player in the old system. The renin catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I (Ang I). This can be overcome by inhibiting renin, a preliminary step, eventually hinders the occurrence of the cascade of events in the RAS. Various peptidomimetics, the first generation renin inhibitors developed six decades ago have limited drug like properties as they suffered from poor intestinal absorption, high liver first pass metabolism and low oral bioavailability. The development of chemically diverse molecules from peptides to nonpeptides expanded the horizon to achieving direct renin inhibition. Aliskiren, a blockbuster drug that emerged as a clinical candidate and got approved by the US FDA in 2007 was developed by molecular modeling studies. Aliskiren indicated superior to average efficacy and with minor adverse effects relative to other RAS inhibitors. However, its therapeutic use is limited by poor oral bioavailability of less than 2% that is similar to first generation peptidic compounds. In this review, we present the development of direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) from peptidic to nonpeptidics that lead to the birth of aliskiren, its place in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and its limitations.	0

212	"Objective The aim of the study is to analyze the latent class of basic reproduction number (R 0 ) trend of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in major endemic areas of China.
The provinces that reported more than 500 cases of COVID 19 till February 18, 2020 were selected as the major endemic area. The Verhulst model was used to fit the growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases. The R 0 of COVID 19 was calculated using the parameters of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID 19, respectively. The latent class of R 0 was analyzed using a latent profile analysis model. Results The median R 0 calculated from SARS and COVID 19 parameters were 1.84  3.18 and 1.74  2.91, respectively. The R 0 calculated from the SARS parameters was greater than that of calculated from the COVID 19 parameters (Z =  4.782   4.623, P < 0.01). Both R 0 can be divided into three latent classes. The initial value of R 0 in class 1 (Shandong Province, Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality) was relatively low and decreases slowly. The initial value of R 0 in class 2 (Anhui Province, Hunan Province, Jiangxi Province, Henan Province, Zhejiang Province, Guangdong Province and Jiangsu Province) was relatively high and decreases rapidly. Moreover, the initial value of R 0 of class 3 (Hubei Province) was between that of class 1 and class 2, but the higher level of R 0 lasts longer and decreases slowly. Conclusion The results indicated that overall trend of R 0 has been falling with the strengthening of China's comprehensive prevention and control measures for COVID 19, however,"	0

Shear force and dilution affect the concentration of bioaerosol emissions. PCD is promising to control bioaerosols because of few secondary pollutants.
Bioaerosols have widely been a concern due to their potential harm to human health caused by the carrying and spreading of harmful microorganisms. Biofiltration has been generally used as a green and effective technology for processing VOCs. However, bioaerosols can be emitted into the atmosphere as secondary pollutants from the biofiltration process. This review presents an overview of bioaerosol emissions from gas bioreactors. The mechanism of bioaerosols production and the effect of biofiltration on bioaerosol emissions were analyzed. The results showed that the bioaerosol emission concentrations were generally exceeded 10 4 CFU m À3 , which would damage to human health. Biomass, inlet gas velocity, moisture content, temperature, and some other factors have significant influences on bioaerosol emissions. Moreover, as a result of the analysis done herein, different inactivation technologies and microbial immobilization of bioaerosols were proposed and evaluated as a potential solution for reducing bioaerosols emissions. The purpose of this paper is to make more people realize the importance of controlling the emissions of bioaerosols in the biofiltration process and to make the treatment of VOCs by biotechnology more environmentally friendly. Additionally, the present work intends to increase people's awareness in regards to the control of bioaerosols, including microbial fragment present in bioaerosols."	0
214	"The goal of this study is to establish a general framework for predicting the so called critical ""Turning Period"" in an infectious disease epidemic such as the COVID 19 outbreak in China early this year. This framework enabled a timely prediction of the turning period when applied to Wuhan COVID 19 epidemic and informed the relevant authority for taking appropriate and timely actions to control the epidemic. It is expected to provide insightful information on turning period for the world's current battle against the COVID 19 pandemic.
The underlying mathematical model in our framework is the individual Susceptible Exposed Infective Removed (iSEIR) model, which is a set of differential equations extending the classic SEIR model. We used the observed daily cases of COVID 19 in Wuhan from February 6 to 10, 2020 as the input to the iSEIR model and were able to generate the trajectory of COVID 19 cases dynamics for the following days at midnight of February 10 based on the updated model, from which we predicted that the turning period of CIVID 19 outbreak in Wuhan would arrive within one week after February 14. This prediction turned to be timely and accurate, providing adequate time for the government, hospitals, essential industry sectors and services to meet peak demands and to prepare aftermath planning.
Our study also supports the observed effectiveness on flatting the epidemic curve by decisively imposing the ""Lockdown and Isolation Control Program"" in Wuhan since January 23, 2020. The Wuhan experience provides an 19."	0

Using mathematical modeling and time transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak. Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 1.1e7). Our findings suggest that R t decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control. Most recent estimates of R t reached values largely below the epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.	1

220	COVID 19 is a novel coronavirus with an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and then pandemic. Based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures the COVID 19 belongs to genera Betacoronavirus. Human Betacoronaviruses (SARS CoV 2, SARS CoV, and MERS CoV) have many similarities, but also have differences in their genomic and phenotypic structure that can influence their pathogenesis. COVID 19 is containing singlestranded (positive sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs. Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one third of the genome near the 3 0  terminus. The genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID 19 in pathogenesis is important. This Betacoronaviruses.	0

(2017) . The goal of this study is to demonstrate the antiviral activity of LH against the novel SARS CoV 2 virus and its potential effect in regulating host immune response. Methods: The antiviral activity of LH against SARS CoV 2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells using CPE and plaque reduction assay. The effect of LH on virion morphology was visualized under transmission electron microscope. Pro inflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS CoV 2 infection in Huh 7 cells were measured by realtime quantitative PCR assays. Results: LH significantly inhibited SARS CoV 2 replication in Vero E6 cells and markedly reduced pro inflammatory cytokines (TNF α, IL 6, CCL 2/MCP 1 and CXCL 10/IP 10) production at the mRNA levels. Furthermore, LH treatment resulted in abnormal particle morphology of virion in cells. Conclusions: LH significantly inhibits the SARS COV 2 replication, affects virus morphology and exerts antiinflammatory activity in vitro. These findings indicate that LH protects against the virus attack, disease.	0

225	We consider and compare various exit strategy building blocks and key measures to mitigate the current SARS CoV 2 pandemic, some already proposed as well as improvements we suggest. Our comparison is based on a computerized simulation integrating accumulated SARS CoV 2 epidemiological knowledge. Our results stress the importance of immediate on symptom isolation of suspected cases and household members, and the beneficial effects of prompt testing capacity. Our findings expose significant epidemic suppression differences among strategies with seemingly similar economic cost stressing the importance of not just the portion of population and business that is released, but also the pattern. The most effective building blocks are the ones that integrate several base strategies  they allow to release large portions of the population while still achieving diminishing viral spread. However, it may come with a price on somewhat more complex schemes. For example, our simulations indicate that dividing the population into two groups completely released except for taking turns on a long weekend (Fri Tue) self isolation once every two weeks, while protecting the 5% most sensitive population would reduce R below 1 even if ten percent of the population does not follow it. We further simulate the contrasting approach of a stratified population release in a hope to achieve herd immunity, which for the time being seems inferior to other suggested building blocks. Knowing the tradeoff between building blocks could help optimize exit strategies to be more effective and suitable for a particular area or country, while maximizing human life as well as economic value. Given our results, we believe that pandemic can be controlled within a reasonable amount of time and at a reasonable socio economic burden.	0

230	The three unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus (HCoV) infections at the beginning of the twentyfirst century have highlighted the necessity for readily available, accurate and fast diagnostic testing methods. The laboratory diagnostic methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially, with the development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests for emerging ones. Newer laboratory methods are fast, highly sensitive and specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) outbreak going on in Wuhan. Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some infections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of the SARS CoV 2 being present in the nasopharynx increases. Several integrated, random access, point of care molecular devices are currently under development for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS CoV 2 infections. These assays are simple, fast and safe and can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients.	0

Vascular Complement deposition in the placentas was not abnormal, and staining for viral RNA and viral spike protein was negative. While all cases resulted in healthy, term deliveries, these findings indicate the systemic nature of COVID 19 infection. The finding of vascular thrombosis without complement deposition may reflect the systemic nature of COVID 19's procoagulant effects unrelated to systemic complement activation.

242	"Background: The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 30 2 (SARS COV 2) has caused more than 2.5 million cases of Corona Virus Disease 31 in the world so far, with that number continuing to grow. To control the 32 spread of the disease, screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate 33 quarantine and treatment is a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is the gold 34 standard but is time consuming with significant false negative results. Therefore, 35 alternative diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based 36 on COVID 19 radiographical changes in CT images, we hypothesized that Artificial 37 Intelligence's deep learning methods might be able to extract COVID 19's specific 38 graphical features and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus 39 saving critical time for disease control.
40 Methods and Findings: We collected 1,065 CT images of pathogen confirmed 41 COVID 19 cases (325 images) along with those previously diagnosed with typical 42 viral pneumonia (740 images). We modified the Inception transfer learning model to 43 establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. The internal 44 validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity 45 of 0.87. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 79.3% with 46 specificity of 0.83 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID 19 images that 47 first two nucleic acid test results were negative, 46 were predicted as COVID 19 48 positive by the algorithm, with the accuracy of 85.2%. : medRxiv preprint 65 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID 19 images that first two nucleic 66 acid test results were negative, 46 were predicted as COVID 19 positive by the 67 algorithm, with the accuracy of 85.2%. Our study represents the first study to apply 68 artificial intelligence to CT images for effectively screening for COVID 19.

243	The current reference for COVID 19 diagnosis is based on the detection of SARS CoV 2 on RNA extracts using one step retrotranscription and quantitative PCR (RT qPCR). Based on the urgent need for high throughput COVID 19 screening, we tested the performance of three alternative, simple and affordable protocols to rapidly detect SARS CoV 2, overcoming the long and tedious RNA extraction step. Although with an average increase of 6.1 (± 1.6) cycles compared to standard tests with RNA extracts, we show that RT qPCR yielded consistent results in nasopharyngeal swab samples that were subject to a direct 70 o C incubation for 10 min. Our findings provide viable options to overcome any supply chain issue and help to increase the throughput of diagnostic tests by using any qPCR device, thereby complementing standard COVID 19 testing.	1

Unexpectedly, the 2109 nCoV RNA was readily detected in the blood (6 of 57 patients) and the anal swabs (11 of 28 patients). Importantly, all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation of serum viral RNA with the disease severity (p value = 0.0001). Meanwhile, 8 of the 11 patients with annal swab virus positive was in severe clinical stage. However, the concentration of viral RNA in the anal swab (Ct value = 24   39) was higher than in the blood (Ct value = 34   39) from patient 2, suggesting that the virus might replicate in the digestive tract. Altogether, our results confirmed the presence of virus RNA in extra pulmonary sites.

252	The novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 (2019 nCoV) is a member of the family coronaviridae and contains a single stranded RNA genome with positive polarity. To reveal the evolution mechanism of SARS CoV 2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly sequenced SARS CoV 2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains. Among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS CoV 2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS CoV 2 WIV04 and Bat SARSr CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29  4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS CoV 2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3' to 5' exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similar between SARS CoV 2 and other strains in beta coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS CoV 2 WIV04 with Bat SARSr CoV RaTG13, the ratios of non synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS CoV 2 under stringent selective pressure. Moreover, some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection. Therefore, our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral pathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts.	0

255	Background: The safety of performing spinal anaesthesia for both patients and anaesthetists alike in the presence of active infection with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is unclear. Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID 19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. Methods: Forty nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID 19 for Caesarean section or lower limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID 19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID 19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results: Forty nine patients with COVID 19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]). Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively. No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia. Of 44 anaesthetists, 37 (84.1%) provided spinal anaesthesia using Level 3 PPE. Coronavirus disease 2019 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in 5/44 (11.4%) anaesthetists. One (2.7%) of 37 anaesthetists who wore Level 3 PPE developed PCR confirmed COVID 19 compared with 4/7 (57.1%) anaesthetists who had Level 1 protection in the operating theatre (relative risk reduction: 95.3% [95% confidence intervals: 63.7e99.4]; P<0.01). Conclusions: Spinal anaesthesia was delivered safely in patients with active COVID 19 infection, the majority of whom had Caesarean sections. Level 3 PPE appears to reduce the risk of transmission to anaesthetists who are exposed to mildly symptomatic surgical patients.	0
256	The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID 19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS CoV 2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS CoV. By screening the experimentally determined SARS CoV derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS CoV 2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS CoV 2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS CoV 2. : bioRxiv preprint B cell responses in recovered study.	0
257	This study assessed knowledge and perceptions about COVID 19 among the general public in Nigeria during the initial week of the pandemic lockdown in the country. From March 28 to April 4, 2020, this cross sectional survey used an anonymous online questionnaire to collect data from respondents within Nigeria. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to recruit 1357 respondents, aged 15 70 years, from 180 cities and towns within Nigeria. Study data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Approximately more than half (57.02%) of the respondents were male with high level of education (48.86% bachelor's degree or higher). Approximately half of the respondents (46.94%) opined that COVID 19 was  a biological weapon designed by the Chinese government.‖ About 94% of the respondents identified  contact with airborne droplets via breathing, sneezing, or coughing‖ as the most common mode of transmission; most respondents associated COVID 19 with coughing (81.13%), shortness of breath (73.47%) and fever (62.79%).  Regular hand washing and social distancing‖ was selected by most respondents (94.25%) as a way of preventing infection whereas 11.86% reported  consuming gins, garlic, ginger, herbal mixtures and African foods/soups‖ as preventive measures against COVID 19. Majority of the respondents (91.73%) thought COVID 19 is deadly; and most respondents (84.3%) got 4 or more answers correctly. It was also observed that the traditional media (TV/Radio) are the most common source of health information about COVID 19 (93.5%). Findings revealed that Nigerians have relatively high knowledge, mostly derived from traditional media, about COVID 19. Their perceptions of COVID 19 bear implications across public health initiatives, compliance with precautionary behavior as well as bilateral relations with foreign nations. Evidence based campaign should be intensified to remove misconceptions and promote precautionary measures.	0
258	"Introduction: As of early December 2019, COVID 19, a disease induced by SARS COV 2, has started spreading, originated in Wuhan, China, and now on, have infected more than 2 million individuals throughout the world.
Purpose: This study aimed to nowcast the COVID 19 outbreak throughout Iran and to forecast the trends of the disease spreading in the upcoming month.
The cumulative incidence and fatality data were extracted from official reports of the National Ministry of Health and Medical Educations of Iran. To formulate the outbreak dynamics, six phenomenological models, as well as a modified mechanistic Susciptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model, were implemented. The models were calibrated with the integrated data, and trends of the epidemic in Iran was then forecasted for the next month.
The final outbreak size calculated by the best fitted phenomenological models was estimated to be in the range of 68,486 to 118,923 cases; however, the calibrated SEIR model estimated that the outbreak would rage again, starting from April 26. Moreover, projected by the mechanistic model, approximately half of the infections have undergone undetected.
Although the advanced phenomenological models perfectly fitted the data, they are incapable of applying behavioral aspects of the outbreak and hence, are not reliable enough for authorities' decision adoptions. In contrast, the mechanistic SEIR model alarms that the COVID 19 outbreak in Iran may peak for the second time, consequent to lifting the control measures. This implies that the government may implement a more granular decision making to control the outbreak. *"	0

260	"become a global crisis. The replication of SARS CoV 2 requires the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a direct target of the antiviral drug, Remdesivir. Here we report the structure of the SARS CoV 2 RdRp either in the apo form or in complex with a 50base template primer RNA and Remdesivir at a resolution range of 2.5 2.8 Å. The complex structure reveals that the partial double stranded RNA template is inserted into the central channel of the RdRp where Remdesivir is incorporated into the first replicated base pair and terminates the chain elongation. Our structures provide critical insights into the working mechanism of viral RNA replication and a rational template for drug design to combat the viral infection.
The pandemic of COVID 19 caused by infection of SARS CoV 2 has become a humanitarian crisis, with over 1.5 million infections and 87,000 death as reported on April 8 th of 2020(1, 2).
SARS CoV 2 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) and several members from the beta coronavirus family, including bat and pangolin coronaviruses(3 5). Possibly due to the stronger binding affinity of the virus spike protein with the host receptor(6 10), SARS CoV 2 appears to have much higher incidence of human to human transmission, resulting in much faster pace of infection worldwide. Tremendous challenges remain with ongoing battles against this notorious viral infection in many countries and finding an effective cure is an urgent need. SARS CoV 2 is a positive strand RNA virus, whose replication is mediated by a multi subunit replication/transcription complex of viral non structural proteins (nsp)(11). The core component of this complex is the catalytic subunit (nsp12) of an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (12, 13) . The nsp12 by itself has little activity and its functions require accessary factors including nsp7 and nsp8 (14, 15) , which increase the RdRp activity in template binding and processivity. The RdRp is also proposed to be the target of nucleotide class of antiviral drugs, including Remdesivir(16 18), which is a prodrug that is converted to the active drug in the triphosphate form (RTP) within cells (19) . As such, RdRp has been a subject of intensive efforts of structural biology. The structures of nsp7, nsp8, and the complex of nsp12 nsp7 nsp8 have been determined (15, (20) (21) (22) (23) , providing an overall architecture of the RdRp complex assembly."	0
261	In the present study, we employed state‐of‐the‐art methods to investigate the time origin and potential rapid expansion of 2019‐nCoV with known sampling date (24 December 2019 and 13 January 2020) and geographic location (Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and Bangkok, Thailand).	1
262	The COVID 19 pandemic has posed a unique challenge for the world to find solutions, ranging from research agenda towards more comprehensive and effective privacy aware contact tracing solutions.	1
263	A new coronavirus, called COVID 19, appeared in the Chinese region of Wuhan at the end of last year; since then the virus spread to other countries, including most of Europe. We propose a differential equation governing the evolution of the COVID 19. This dynamic equation also describes the evolution of the number of infected people for 13 common respiratory viruses (including the COVID 19). We validate our theoretical predictions with experimental data for Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg, and compare them with the predictions of the logistic model. We find that our predictions are in good agreement with the real world since the beginning of the appearance of the COVID 19; this is not the case for the logistic model that only applies to the first days. The second part of the work is devoted to modelling the descending phase, i.e. the decrease of the number of people tested positive for COVID 19. Also in this case, we propose a new set of dynamic differential equations that we solved numerically. We use our differential equations parametrised with experimental data to make several predictions, such as the date when Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg will reach a peak number of COVID 19 infected people. We shall see that the descending curves provide valuable information such as the duration of the COVID 19 epidemic in a given Country (and therefore when it will be possible to return to normal life) measures.	0

267	"Protection of healthcare workforce is of paramount relevance for the care of infected and non infected patients in the setting of a pandemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 . Healthcare workers are at increased risk to become infected because of contact to infected patients, infected co workers and their community outside the hospital. The ideal organisational strategy to protect the healthcare workforce in a situation in which social distancing cannot be maintained at the workplace remains to be determined. In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. Therefore, deterministic models were extended to account for stochastic influences potentially occurring in rather small populations. The models were also designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivity depending on the infection rate, the presence of reinfection and the efficiency of home office. As an application example, we apply our theory to the case of coronavirus disease 2019 . The results of the models reveal that a desynchronization strategy in which two medical teams work alternating for 7 days reduces the infection rate of the healthcare workforce.
During the spread of worldwide pandemics, protecting and supporting caregivers to maintain the workforce in hospitals is a crucial and challenging task. Under such extraordinary situations, the efficiency of healthcare workforce is threatened by several factors including: 1) infected patients, 2) infected co workers and 3) infected persons outside the hospital. This is of high importance in the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 given that the virus may be transmitted by asymptomatic persons based on the long incubation period averaging at 5 days (1, 2). Unlike for most other professions, social distancing is typically not possible in medical teams where healthcare workers are required to work in close contact with patients and coworkers.
Currently, little is known about which work organizational strategies in the hospital are most suitable protect the healthcare workforce. Potential strategies may include prolonging duty hours and thereby limiting interactions between coworkers or complete desynchronization of the workforce in which teams are dichotomized and each half of the team works for one week alternatively.

Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co expressed the MERS CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV TP obtained here with a steady state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogs. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i ؉ 3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3 5 exonuclease activity. Together, these results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell based assays.	0

274	The basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a naïve, uninfected population. It is well known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019 nCoV need to be revised. By using time dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th , 2020 and re estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.	0
275	"Rationale and Objectives: To retrospectively analyze the chest imaging findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) on thin section CT.
Materials and Methods: Fifty three patients with confirmed COVID 19 infection underwent thin section CT examination. Two chest radiologists independently evaluated the imaging in terms of distribution, ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, air bronchogram, stripe, enlarged mediastinal lymph node, and pleural effusion.
Results: Fourty seven cases (88.7%) had findings of COVID 19 infection, and the other six (11.3%) were normal. Among the 47 cases, 78.7% involved both lungs, and 93.6% had peripheral infiltrates distributed along the subpleural area. All cases showed GGO, 59.6% of which were round and 40.4% patchy. Other imaging features included ""crazy paving pattern"" (89.4%), consolidation (63.8%), and air bronchogram (76.6%). Air bronchograms were observed within GGO (61.7%) and consolidation (70.3%). Neither enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes nor pleural effusion were present. Thirty three patients (62.3%) were followed an average interval of 6.2 § 2.9 days. The lesions increased in 75.8% and resorbed in 24.2% of patients.
Conclusion: COVID 19 showed the pulmonary lesions in patients infected with COVID 19 were predominantly distributed peripherally in the subpleural area."	0

277	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has recently caused a pandemic that has involved Italy as the second worldwide nation in terms of infected patients and deaths. The clinical manifestation of Covid 19 ranges from asymptomatic carrier status to severe pneumonia. Asymptomatic individuals in Covid 19 are those who are carriers of the virus but do not show clinical symptoms and are able to transmit the disease in the same degree as symptomatic carriers. In order to contain contagions is of supreme importance to identify asymptomatic patients because this subpopulation is one of the main factors contributing to the spread of this disease. We report on six Italian patients with COVID 19 who presented sudden hyposmia as the only or most prominent disease manifestation, without upper or lower respiratory tract involvement or other major features of the disease. A supra threshold olfaction test confirmed the hyposmia in all patients.	0

279	"Main point: Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine at inhibiting SARS CoV 2 in vitro. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg given twice daily for 1 day, followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4 more days is recommended to treat SARS CoV 2 infection.
Abstract Background. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS CoV 2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late phase in critically ill SARS CoV 2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS CoV 2 infection.
Methods. The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS CoV 2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug's safety profile.
Results. Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 μM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 μM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS CoV 2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.
Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to 4 / 25 inhibit SARS CoV 2 in vitro."	0

283	We present a robust data driven machine learning analysis of the COVID 19 pandemic from its early infection dynamics, specifically infection counts over time. The goal is to extract actionable public health insights. These insights include the infectious force, the rate of a mild infection becoming serious, estimates for asymtomatic infections and predictions of new infections over time. We focus on USA data starting from the first confirmed infection on January 20 2020. Our methods reveal significant asymptomatic (hidden) infection, a lag of about 10 days, and we quantitatively confirm that the infectious force is strong with about a 0.14% transition from mild to serious infection. Our methods are efficient, robust and general, being agnostic to the specific virus and applicable to different populations or cohorts.	1

Purpose: To identify differences in CT imaging and clinical features between COVID 19 and influenza pneumonia in the early stage, and to identify the most valuable features in the differential diagnosis.
A consecutive cohort of 73 COVID 19 and 48 influenza pneumonia patients were retrospectively recruited from five independent institutions. The courses of both diseases were confirmed to be in the early stages (2.66 ± 2.62 days for COVID 19 and 2.19 ± 2.10 days for influenza pneumonia after onset). The chi square test, student's t test, and Kruskal Wallis H test were performed to compare CT imaging and clinical features between the two groups. Spearman or Kendall correlation tests between feature metrics and diagnosis outcomes were also assessed. The diagnostic performance of each feature in differentiating COVID 19 from influenza pneumonia was evaluated with univariate analysis. The corresponding area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and threshold were reported."	0
287	"Background As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID 19 from news media and social networks.
In this population level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health care oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID 19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID 19 and daily province level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID 19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID 19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time.
Findings We collected data for 507 patients with COVID 19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35 60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0·0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5·2%) of 9826 patients with COVID 19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020.
Interpretation News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID 19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID 19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions."	0

289	Since Dec 2019, the COVID 19 epidemic has spread over the globe creating one of the greatest pandemics ever witnessed. This epidemic wave will only begin to roll back once a critical proportion of the population is immunised, either by mounting natural immunity following infection, or by vaccination. The latter option can minimise the cost in terms of human lives but it requires to wait until a safe and efficient vaccine is developed, a period estimated to last at least 18 months. In this work, we use optimal control theory to explore the best strategy to implement while waiting for the vaccine. We seek a solution minimizing deaths and costs due to the implementation of the control strategy itself. We find that such a solution leads to an increasing level of control with a maximum reached near the fourth month of the epidemics and a steady decrease until vaccine deployment. This strategy strongly outperforms others with constant or cycling allocations of the same amount of resources to control the outbreak. This work opens new perspectives to mitigate the effects of the ongoing COVID 19 pandemics, and be used as a proof of concept in using mathematical modelling techniques to enlighten decision making and public health management in the early times of an outbreak.	0

291	"Background: Countries vary in their response to the COVID 19 pandemic. Some emphasise social distancing, while others focus on other interventions. Evidence on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of these interventions is urgently needed to guide public health policy and avoid unnecessary damage to the economy and other harms. We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence on epidemic control, with a focus on cost effectiveness. were searched using a range of terms related to epidemic control. Reviews, randomized trials, observational studies, and modelling studies were included. Articles reporting on the effectiveness or cost effectiveness of at least one intervention were included and grouped into higher quality (randomized trials) and lower quality evidence (other study designs).
We found 1,653 papers; 34 were included. Higher quality evidence was only available to support the effectiveness of hand washing and face masks. Modelling studies suggested that these measures are highly cost effective. For other interventions, only evidence from observational and modelling studies was available. A cautious interpretation of this body of lower quality evidence suggests that: (1) the most cost effective interventions are swift contact tracing and case isolation, surveillance networks, protective equipment for healthcare workers, and early vaccination (when available); (2) home quarantines and stockpiling antivirals are less cost All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. effective; (3) social distancing measures like workplace and school closures are effective but costly, making them the least cost effective options; (4) combinations are more cost effective than single interventions; (5) interventions are more cost effective when adopted early and for severe viruses like SARS CoV 2. For H1N1 influenza, contact tracing was estimated to be 4,363 times more cost effective than school closures ($2,260 vs. $9,860,000 per death prevented).
A cautious interpretation of this body of evidence suggests that for COVID 19: (1) social distancing is effective but costly, especially when adopted late and (2) adopting as early as possible a combination of interventions that includes hand washing, face masks, swift contact tracing and case isolation, and protective equipment for healthcare workers is likely to be the most cost effective strategy.

WHO officially named this coronavirus as COVID 19. Since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12, 2019, China has reported a total of 78,824 confirmed CONID 19 cases and 2,788 deaths as of February 28, 2020. Wuhan's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths accounted for 61.1% and 76.5% of the whole China mainland , making it the priority center for epidemic prevention and control. Meanwhile, 51 countries and regions outside China have reported 4,879 confirmed cases and 79 deaths as of February 28, 2020. COVID 19 epidemic does great harm to people's daily life and country's economic development. This paper adopts three kinds of mathematical models, i.e., Logistic model, Bertalanffy model and Gompertz model. The epidemic trends of SARS were first fitted and analyzed in order to prove the validity of the existing mathematical models. The results were then used to fit and analyze the situation of COVID 19. The prediction results of three different mathematical models are different for different parameters and in different regions. In general, the fitting effect of Logistic model may be the best among the three models studied in this paper, while the fitting effect of Gompertz model may be better than Bertalanffy model. According to the current trend, based on the three models, the total number of people expected to be infected is 49852 57447 in Wuhan,12972 13405 in non Hubei areas and 80261 85140 Wuhan,"	0

In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 31 pregnant women and 35 non pregnant women from Jan 28 to Feb 28, 2020 to evaluate the effects of SARS CoV 2 infection during pregnancy.
Inflammatory indices were used to assess the severity of COVID 19. Evidence of vertical transmission was determined by laboratory confirmation of SARS CoV 2 in amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples.
Findings Compared with non pregnant women, pregnant women had a significantly lower proportion of fever (54·8% vs. 87·5%, p= 0.006), a shorter average interval from onset to hospitalization (7·80 ±7·0d vs. 13·2 ± 8·2d, p= 0.005), and a higher proportion of severe or critical COVID 19 (32·3% vs.
11·4%, p=0.039). Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systematic immune inflammation based prognostic index (SII) were significantly higher on admission in severe/critical pneumonia group than moderate pneumonia group. We could not detect the presence of SARS CoV 2 by RT PCR in amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples.
The clinical symptoms of COVID 19 in pregnant women were insidious and atypical, compared with those in non pregnant patients. SII and NLR could be a useful marker to evaluate the severity of COVID 19. There was no evidence of vertical transmission during pregnancy with SARS CoV 2 infection."	0

Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnostics of SARS CoV 2. However, the positive rate of RT qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30~60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach.
METHODS：We established a reverse transcription digital PCR (RT dPCR) protocol to detect SARS CoV 2 on 194 clinical pharyngeal swab samples, including 103 suspected patients, 75 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents.
The limit of blanks (LoBs) of the RT dPCR assays were ~1.6, ~1.6 and ~0.8 copies/reaction for ORF 1ab, N and E genes, respectively. The limit of detection (LoD) was 2 copies/reaction. For the 103 fever suspected patients, the sensitivity of SARS CoV 2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT qPCR to 87.4% by RT dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21% down to 1%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT dPCR were 90%, 100% and 93 %, respectively. In addition, quantification of the viral load for convalescents by RT dPCR showed that a longer observation period was needed in the hospital for elderly patients.

305	Detection of pathogenic sequences or variants in DNA and RNA through a point of care diagnostic approach is valuable for rapid clinical prognosis. In recent times, CRISPR based detection of nucleic acids has provided an economical and quicker alternative to sequencing based platforms which are often difficult to implement in the field. Here, we present FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) that employs a highly accurate enzymatic readout for detecting nucleotide sequences, identifying nucleobase identity and inferring zygosity with precision. We demonstrate that FELUDA output can be adapted to multiple signal detection platforms and can be quickly designed and deployed for versatile applications including rapid diagnosis during infectious disease outbreaks like COVID 19. : bioRxiv preprint optimization for every variant and Cas13 requires conversion to an RNA template prior to detection, both of which increases the complexity and thus the time taken for diagnosis. Taken together, development of a detection pipeline based on a highly specific CRISPR protein with a direct binding or cleavage based readout can significantly increase the sensitivity of detection and reduce the time and cost of CRISPR based diagnostics (CRISPRDx), This is especially crucial for point of care (POC) applications where complex experimentation or setup of reaction components are not feasible.	0
306	At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, 2019 nCoV, caused an outbreak of pneumonia spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China, which has posed great threats to public health and attracted enormous attention around the world. To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these human coronavirus infections. Intensive research on the novel emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate their route of transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential drug targets, which would promote the development of effective preventive and therapeutic countermeasures. Herein, we describe the epidemic and etiological characteristics of 2019 nCoV, discuss its essential biological features, including tropism and receptor usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention and treatment, and speculate on the transmission route of 2019 nCoV.	1

310	"The ongoing new coronavirus (2019 nCoV) pneumonia outbreak is spreading in China and has not reached its peak. Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak.
The officially reported cases of 2019 nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020.
Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number.
The 2019 nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number.

Based on the susceptible exposed infected removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019 nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real time reports on the number of 2019 nCoV infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues.
The early transmission ability of 2019 nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS.
It is a controllable disease with moderate to high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are needed to prevent the further transmissions.

Several reports observed a reduction of lymphocytes among COVID 19 patients. However, clinical significance of lymphocyte reduction in COVID 19 patients remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze the association between lymphocyte reduction at early stage and the prognosis of COVID 19 patients.
All 192 hospitalized patients with COVID 19 were enrolled. Electronic medical records, including demographic data, clinical characteristics, comorbidities and exposure history, were collected. Biochemical indexes on admission and chest computed tomography (CT) were detected. Patient's prognosis was followed up.
Results: On admission, 84 (43.8%) patients suffered from lymphocyte reduction among COVID 19 patients. The count and percentage of lymphocytes on admission were lower among more than seventy year old patients than those of younger patients.
Multivariate logistic regression revealed that older age was a risk factor of lymphocyte reduction. Of interest, chest CT score, a key marker of lung injury, was increased among COVID 19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. By contrast, PaCO2, SpO2 and oxygenation index, several respiratory function markers, were decreased in COVID 19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Moreover, TBIL and DBIL, two markers of hepatic injury, creatinine and urea nitrogen, two indices of renal function, and creatine kinase, AST and LDH, three myocardial enzymes, were elevated in COVID 19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Among 84 COVID 19 patients with lymphocyte reduction, 32.1% died. Fatality rate was obviously higher in COVID 19"	0
326	Since December 2019, multiple cases of 2019 coronavirus disease have been reported in Wuhan in China's Hubei Province, a disease which has subsequently spread rapidly across the entire country. Highly infectious, COVID 19 has numerous transmission channels and humans are highly susceptible to infection. The main clinical symptoms of COVID 19 are fever, fatigue, and a dry cough. Laboratory examination in the early stage of the disease shows a normal or decreased white blood cell count, and a decreased lymphocyte count. While CT examination serves as the screening and diagnostic basis for COVID 19, its accuracy is limited. The nucleic acid testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID 19, but has a low sensitivity is low. There is clearly a divide between the two means of examination.

329	"BACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD 19 in the UK has now been confirmed. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID  19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID 19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID 19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission.
CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID 19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID 19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised. There has been no evidence of vertical transmission to date. The RCOG and RCPCH have provided interim guidance to help maternity and neonatal services plan their response to COVID 19.

After triple washes in CSB, cells were cultured with antibodies in a total 50 μL CSD for 30 min in RT, triple washed in CSB and incubated with 0.125 μm intercalator in fix and perm buffer (Fluidigm) at 4 ℃ overnight.
After cultured with intercalator, cells were washed three times with ice cold PBS and three times with deionized water. Prior to acquisition, samples were resuspended in deionized water containing 10% EQ 4 Element Beads (Fluidigm) and cell concentrations were adjusted to 1×10 6 cell/ml. Data acquisition was performed on a Helios mass cytometer (Fluidigm). The original FCS data were normalized and .fcs files for everyone were collected.
All .fcs files were uploaded into Cytobank, data cleaning and populations of single living cells were exported as .fcs files for further analysis. Files were loaded into R (http://www.rstudio.com), arcsinh transform was performed to signal intensities of all channels. PhenoGraph analysis was performed."	0

Abdominal auscultation is particularly useful for assessing the motility of the large intestine. Progressive motility of the small intestine, conversely, is difficult to distinguish by auscultation from nonprogressive motility. The distinct character of the borborygmi produced during propulsive contractions of the cecum and ascending colon allow evaluation of the frequency and strength of retropulsion and propulsion. Propulsive contractions of the cecum and ventral colon occur every 3 to 4 minutes and give rise to prolonged rushing sounds heard over long segments of intestine. Retropulsive sounds presumably are similar to propulsive sounds, but they occur less frequently. The distinction of propulsion from retropulsion is not important clinically because both types of contractions signify normal motility. Inter and intrahaustral mixing contractions produce nonspecific sounds of fluid and ingesta movement that are difficult to distinguish from other borborygmi, such as small intestinal contractions or spasmodic contractions. 1 Auscultation over the right flank and proceeding along the caudal edge of the costal margin toward the xiphoid allows evaluation of the cecal borborygmi. Auscultation over a similar area on the left side allows evaluation of the pelvic flexure and ascending colon. Typical progressive borborygmi heard every 3 to 4 minutes on both sides of the abdomen indicate normal motility of the cecum and ascending colon. Less frequent progressive sounds may indicate a pathologic condition of the large intestine or may result from anorexia, nervousness (sympathetic tone), or pharmacologic inhibition of

334	Proteins are dynamic molecules that constitute the molecular machinery of living cells. Single particle cryo EM excels as an imaging technique to solve static structures of proteins, but existing computational 3D reconstruction methods for cryo EM data have not been effective in practice for solving structures or modelling motion of flexible proteins. We introduce 3D variability analysis (3DVA), an algorithm that models the conformational landscape of a molecule as a linear subspace, and is able to fit the model to experimental cryo EM data at high resolution. 3DVA makes it possible, for the first time, to resolve and visualize detailed molecular motions of both large and small proteins. Through extensive experimental results on cryo EM data, we demonstrate the ability of 3DVA to resolve multiple flexible motions of α helices in the sub 50 kDa transmembrane domain of a GPCR complex, bending modes of a sodium ion channel, five types of symmetric and symmetry breaking flexibility in a proteasome, and large motions in a spliceosome complex. We also show that 3DVA can uncover discrete conformational states of heterogenous mixtures of ribosome particles from a single sample. The results demonstrate that 3DVA enables new biological insight to be extracted from single particle cryo EM data. 3DVA is implemented in the cryoSPARC software package, and has already been used successfully in several notable structural studies.	0
335	According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic is putting even the best healthcare systems across the world under tremendous pressure. The early detection of this type of virus will help in relieving the pressure of the healthcare systems. Chest X rays has been playing a crucial role in the diagnosis of diseases like Pneumonia. As COVID 19 is a type of influenza, it is possible to diagnose using this imaging technique. With rapid development in the area of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep learning, there had been intelligent systems to classify between Pneumonia and Normal patients. This paper proposes the machine learning based classification of the extracted deep feature using ResNet152 with COVID 19 and Pneumonia patients on chest X ray images. SMOTE is used for balancing the imbalanced data points of COVID 19 and Normal patients. This non invasive and early prediction of novel coronavirus (COVID 19) by analyzing chest X rays can further be used to predict the spread of the virus in asymptomatic patients. The model is achieving an accuracy of 0.973 on Random Forest and 0.977 using XGBoost predictive classifiers. The establishment of such an approach will be useful to predict effectively.	0
336	Although initial reports were of very limited human to human spread, the recent increase in cases, including 15 health care workers, reports of super spreaders and the spread of the virus to other Chinese cities and various Asian countries have evidenced that there is indeed human to human transmission.

338	The main purpose of the study is to introduce the wavelength models developed to measure the size of outbreaks based on the COVID 19 example. In this way, the wavelengths of the outbreaks can be calculated, ensuring that the outbreaks are valid, reliable and easy to follow at the national and international level. Wavelength models consist of approved case, death, recovered case and net wavelength models. Thus, the size of the outbreak can be measured both individually and as a whole. COVID 19 cases of 181 countries were used to demonstrate the application of the models. The prominent findings in the applied wavelength models are as follows: the countries with the highest case wavelength are USA, Italy, Spain and Germany, respectively. However, Italy ranks first in the death wavelength, followed by Spain, the USA and France. On the other hand, China has taken the first place in the recovered case wavelength. This country was followed by Spain and Germany and Italy, respectively. Based on all these wavelength models mentioned, net wavelength lengths are calculated. According to the findings of net wavelengths obtained, Canada ranked first, followed by United Kingdom, USA and Italy, respectively.	0

Abstract: The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID 19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS CoV 2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS CoV. By screening the experimentally determined SARS CoV derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS CoV 2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS CoV 2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help 2."	0

Preexisting chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and asthma were thought to predict risk of progression to severe infections.
We aimed to quantify the frequency of chronic comorbidities in flavivirus diseases to provide an estimate for their prevalence in severe and non severe infections and examine whether chronic diseases contribute to the increased risk of severe viral expression.
We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase and Embase Classic and grey literature databases to identify studies reporting prevalence estimates of comorbidities in flavivirus diseases. Study quality was assessed with the risk of bias tool. Age adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for severe infection in the presence of chronic comorbidities.
We identified 65 studies as eligible for inclusion for DENV (47 studies) and WNV (18 studies). Obesity and overweight (i.e., BMI> 25 kg/m 2 , prevalence: 24.5%, 95% CI: 18.6 31.6%), hypertension (17.1%, 13.3 21.8%) and diabetes (13.3%, 9.3 18.8%) were the most prevalent comorbidities in DENV.

Specifically, our method is able to produce stable and accurate forecasts 2 days ahead of current time, and uses as inputs (a) official health reports from Chinese Center Disease for Control and Prevention (China CDC), (b) COVID 19 related internet search activity from Baidu, (c) news media activity reported by Media Cloud, and (d) daily forecasts of COVID 19 activity from GLEAM, an agent based mechanistic model. Our machine learning methodology uses a clustering technique that enables the exploitation of geo spatial synchronicities of COVID 19 activity across Chinese provinces, and a data augmentation technique to deal with the small number of historical disease activity observations, characteristic of emerging outbreaks. Our model's predictive power outperforms a collection of baseline models 1 arXiv:2004.04019v1 [stat.OT] 8 Apr 2020 in 27 out of the 32 Chinese provinces, and could be easily extended to other makers.	0

Here, the infectious ability of patients during the latent period is slightly less than that of the infected patients was assumed. We established a new SEIR propagation dynamics model, that considered the weak transmission ability of the incubation period, the variation of the incubation period length, and the government intervention measures to track and isolate comprehensively. Based on the raw epidemic data of China from January 23, 2020 to February 10, 2020, the dynamic parameters of the new present SEIR model are fitted. Through the Euler integration algorithm to solve the model, the effect of infectious ability of incubation patients on the theoretical estimation of the present SEIR model was analyzed, and the occurrence time of peak number in China was predicted.

Methods In this retrospective, single centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019 nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real time RT PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.
patients showed multiple mottling and ground glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneu mothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.
Interpretation The 2019 nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019 nCoV infection."	0

The sudden outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 increased the diagnostic burden of radiologists. In the time of an epidemic crisis, we hoped artificial intelligence (AI) to help reduce physician workload in regions with the outbreak, and improve the diagnosis accuracy for physicians before they could acquire enough experience with the new disease. Here, we present our experience in building and deploying an AI system that automatically analyzes CT images to detect COVID 19 pneumonia features. Different from conventional medical AI, we were dealing with an epidemic crisis. Working in an interdisciplinary team of over 30 people with medical and / or AI background, geographically distributed in Beijing and Wuhan, we were able to overcome a series of challenges in this particular situation and deploy the system in four weeks. Using 1,136 training cases (723 positives for COVID 19) from five hospitals, we were able to achieve a sensitivity of 0.974 and specificity of 0.922 on the test dataset, which included a variety of pulmonary diseases. Besides, the system automatically highlighted all lesion regions for faster examination. As of today, we have deployed the system 2 All rights reserved.

357	"Rapid spread of SARS CoV 2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen and elsewhere in China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control.
The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS CoV 2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk.
Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 21 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days.
Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS CoV 2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control."	0
358	As the COVID 19 pandemic continues its march around the world, an unprecedented amount of open data is being generated for genetics and epidemiological research. The unparalleled rate at which many research groups around the world are releasing data and publications on the ongoing pandemic is allowing other scientists to learn from local experiences and data generated in the front lines of the COVID 19 pandemic. However, there is a need to integrate additional data sources that map and measure the role of social dynamics of such a unique world wide event into biomedical, biological, and epidemiological analyses. For this purpose, we present a large scale curated dataset of over 152 million tweets, growing daily, related to COVID 19 chatter generated from January 1st to April 4th at the time of writing. This open dataset will allow researchers to conduct a number of research projects relating to the emotional and mental responses to social distancing measures, the identification of sources of misinformation, and the stratified measurement of sentiment towards the pandemic in near real time.	0
359	"There is an urgent need to project how transmission of the novel betacoronavirus SARS CoV 2 will unfold in coming years. These dynamics will depend on seasonality, the duration of immunity, and the strength of cross immunity to/from the other human coronaviruses. Using data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS CoV 2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS CoV 2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to SARS CoV 2.
Main text. The ongoing SARS CoV 2 epidemic has caused nearly 80,000 detected cases of COVID 19 illness and claimed over 2,500 lives as of 24 Feb 2020 (1). With sustained transmission reported in China, Japan, Iran, Italy, and South Korea (1), the outbreak is on the verge of becoming a pandemic. The required intensity, duration, and urgency of public health responses will depend on how the initial pandemic wave unfolds and on the subsequent transmission dynamics of SARS CoV 2. One possibility is that SARS CoV 2 will follow its closest genetic relative, SARS CoV, and be eradicated by intensive public health measures after causing a brief but intense epidemic (2). Increasingly, public health authorities consider this scenario unlikely (3). Alternatively, the transmission of SARS CoV 2 could resemble that of pandemic influenza by circulating seasonally after causing an initial global wave of infection (4).
Such a scenario could reflect the previous emergence of known human coronaviruses from zoonotic origins e.g. human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 (5). This paper identifies viral, environmental, and immunologic factors which in combination will determine which scenarios in fact play out, and identifies key data needed to distinguish between them.
The transmission dynamics of the SARS CoV 2 epidemic will depend on factors including the degree of seasonal variation in transmission strength, the duration of immunity, and the degree of cross immunity between SARS CoV 2 and other coronaviruses. SARS CoV 2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus, which includes the SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, and two other human coronaviruses, HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1. The SARS and MERS coronaviruses cause severe illness with case fatality rates of 9 and 36% respectively, but the transmission of both has remained limited (6). HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1 infections may be asymptomatic or associated with mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness; these HCoVs are considered the second most common cause of the common cold (6). While investigations into the spectrum of illness caused by SARS CoV 2 are ongoing, recent evidence indicates the majority of cases experience mild illness with more limited occurrence of severe lower respiratory infection (7). Current COVID 19 case fatality rates in China are estimated at 2.9% within Hubei province, and 0.4% outside (8), suggesting lower severity than SARS and MERS but higher severity than HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1. In terms of transmission, the ability of SARS CoV 2 to cause widespread infection is more reflective of HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1 than of its more clinically severe relatives. HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1 cause annual wintertime outbreaks of respiratory illness in temperate regions (9, 10), suggesting that wintertime climate and host behaviors may facilitate transmission, as is true for influenza (11) (12) (13) . Immunity to HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1 appears to wane appreciably within one year (14), while SARS infection can induce longer lasting immunity (15). The .

Cyclothymic (OR: 1.17; p=0.008) and depressive (OR: 1.32; p=0.003) temperaments resulted as risk factors in subjects with moderate to severe psychological distress compared to mild distress, while the ASQ ""Confidence"" (OR: 0.92; p=0.039) and ""Discomfort with closeness"" (OR: 0.94; p=0.023) were protective.
Our data indicated that a relevant rate of individuals may have experienced psychological distress following the COVID 19 outbreak. Specific affective temperament and attachment features predict the extent of mental health burden.

361	The global spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) is overwhelming many health care systems. As a result, epidemiological models are being used to inform policy on how to effectively deal with this pandemic. We note that the majority of existing models do not take into account differences in the amount of interactions between individuals (i.e. the underlying human interaction network). Using network science we demonstrate how this network of interactions can be used to predict the spread of the virus and to inform policy on the most successful mitigation and suppression strategies. Although applicable to disease modelling in general, our results emphasize how network science can improve the predictive power of current COVID 19 epidemiological models. We provide commented source code for all our analyses so that they can easily be integrated into current and future epidemiological models.	0

Un nouveau paramyxovirus, le métapneumovirus humain, a été récemment isolé. Nous rapportons les premiers cas pédiatriques français d'infection respiratoire à ce virus, détectés entre 2000 et 2002. Matériel et méthodes.  Les prélèvements ont été obtenus par aspirations nasales chez des enfants hospitalisés pour infections respiratoires dans les services de pédiatrie du centre hospitalier universitaire de Caen et de l'hôpital de Flers. La recherche du métapneumovirus humain a été effectuée par polymerase chain reaction sur les prélèvements négatifs pour les virus respiratoire syncytial, virus influenza A et B, virus para influenza (1, 2 et 3), adénovirus, entérovirus, coronavirus et rhinovirus. La comparaison de la morbidité des infections à métapneumovirus et virus respiratoire syncytial a été effectuée après appariement des sexe, âge et mois d'infection.
Résultats.  Vingt six cas d'infection à métapneumovirus humain ont été identifiés. L'étude comparative avec une cohorte appariée de nourrissons infectés par le virus respiratoire syncytial n'a retrouvé aucune différence significative en ce qui concerne les motifs d'hospitalisation, les signes cliniques et la prise en charge thérapeutique.
Conclusion.  Le métapneumovirus humain est responsable d'un tableau typique de bronchiolite aiguë du nourrisson.

Background The worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is associated with a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS associated coronavirus (SARS CoV). We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS.
Methods We tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARS CoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens. We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.
Findings SARS CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically. SARS CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS. The four SARS CoV infected macaques excreted SARS CoV from required to prove that SARS CoV is the primary cause of SARS."	0

367	"Background: GenBank contains over 3 million viral sequences. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) previously made available a tool for validating and annotating influenza virus sequences that is used to check submissions to GenBank. Before this project, there was no analogous tool in use for non influenza viral sequence submissions. Results: We developed a system called VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) that validates and annotates viral sequences in GenBank submissions. The annotation system is based on the analysis of the input nucleotide sequence using models built from curated RefSeqs. Hidden Markov models are used to classify sequences by determining the RefSeq they are most similar to, and feature annotation from the RefSeq is mapped based on a nucleotide alignment of the full sequence to a covariance model. Predicted proteins encoded by the sequence are validated with nucleotide to protein alignments using BLAST. The system identifies 43 types of ""alerts"" that (unlike the previous BLAST based system) provide deterministic and rigorous feedback to researchers who submit sequences with unexpected characteristics"	0
368	"Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV 2 or COVID 19 coronavirus started in China in December 2019, there is increasing evidence that those with existing comorbidities, older age or a compromised immune system are at higher risk of developing severe and even fatal respiratory diseases [1]. One laboratory study which treated porcine respiratory coronavirus infected pigs with dexamethasone suggested that one or two doses of the corticosteroid in the acute phase of infection may effectively alleviate early pro inflammatory response, but prolonged administration may play a role in enhancing viral replication [18].

374	In December 2019, several patients with pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan, China. On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus, later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV). Genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019 nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus. As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in China and 77 patients in other countries. It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019 nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact. This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread. The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose. Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible or the virus may cause a serious pandemic. Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus. In this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019 nCoV related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and China.	0

Based on immunologic studies of YFV vaccine recipients, neutralizing antibody generally peaks 4 6 weeks after infection but high titers of neutralizing antibodies persist for more than 10 years and provide complete protection against disease on reexposure to the virus. No documented case of a second clinical YFV infection has ever been reported. Although initial antibody response to infection is YFV antigen specific, with affinity maturation, specificity declines and cross reactions with other flaviviruses develop during the subsequent several week of the immune response. Persons with prior heterologous flavivirus immunity develop broadly cross reactive antibody responses during YFV infections. Previous infection with flaviviruses, such as Zika, dengue, or Wesselsbron viruses, provides partial cross protection against YFV and may ameliorate the clinical severity of YF.
Domestic control of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes remains important but is difficult to sustain. Currently, the most effective approach to control of YF is by immunizing persons living in or traveling to endemic areas. 17D vaccine is the only strain currently used for human immunization against YFV. It is a live, attenuated vaccine produced in embryonated chicken eggs. 17D vaccines are not biologically cloned and are heterogeneous mixtures of multiple virion subpopulations ('genetic swarms'); differences in plaque size, oligonucleotide fingerprints, and nucleotide sequences have been found but do not appear to affect safety or efficacy. Currently, manufacturers in seven countries market YFV 17D vaccine. Three manufacturers in Brazil, France, and Senegal produce large amounts of vaccine for the Expanded Programme of Immunization and for mass vaccination campaigns. As of 2006, annual global vaccine production was approximately 60 million doses.
Monath et al. thoroughly review the development, immune response, and efficacy of the 17D vaccine strain.
As of 2006, over 400 million persons have been immunized with YFV vaccines. Over roughly 70 years of use, 17D vaccines have been acknowledged as one of the safest and most effective live vaccines in use. Recently, however, close scrutiny has been brought to bear as clinical and histopathological evidence has emerged linking 17D vaccines to severe and previously unrecognized adverse events, including viscerotropic disease closely resembling that caused by wild type YFV. Although rare mutational events in 17D vaccine virus during replication in the host can alter pathogenicity, these recently reported serious adverse events were not associated with either mutations that change virulence or tropism of the virus or selection of virulent variants in vivo. Investigations suggest that host susceptibility, rather than a change in the virus, is responsible for these serious, adverse events. Advanced age and thymic disease appear to be risk factors for development of vaccine associated viscerotropic disease. The incidence of this complication, which carries a case fatality rate of approximately 50%, is believed to be 1:400 000."	0

387	COVID 19 started in Hubei province in China and has spread to 210 countries within 3 months. The statistic of COVID 19 across the world is reported daily, providing a dynamic perspective for each country. We tested the hypothesis that the vaccination against tuberculosis with BCG correlates with better outcomes for COVID 19 patients. To this end, we combined the information on demography, economy, major chronic diseases, and immunization policies with the COVID 19 outcomes. We filtered out at a fixed date all countries that were below a predetermined value for population size and number of COVID 19 deaths per million (DPM). Altogether, 55 countries, covering 62.9% of the world population, met our criteria and were analyzed. To allow a reliable comparison between countries, each was aligned to a critical alignment threshold date (0.5 DPM). We found that the years of BCG admission are negatively correlated with DPM at varying times post alignment. Results from multivariable regression tests with 22 quantitative properties of each country and its population substantiate the dominant contribution of BCG admission years to the COVID 19 outcomes. Analyzing countries according to an age group partition across several time points, reveals that the strongest correlation is attributed to the coverage in BCG vaccination of the young population (<25 years), to a lesser degree the middle age group (25 64 years), while BCG coverage status of the elderly (>65 years) was insignificant. More specifically, the signal is attributed to recent immunizations (last 15 years) rather than past policies. We propose that BCG immunization coverage, especially among the most recently vaccinated, may contribute to attenuation of the COVID 19 spread and severity.	0

Methods: The infusion management group optimized the intravenous infusion workflow based on Hamer's Process Reengineering Theory and applied it to the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. The work efficiency, patients' satisfaction and economic indicators before and after optimization were compared. Results: After the infusion workflow was optimized, average times for preparation drugs and intravenous admixture, and patients' waiting time decreased from 4.84 min, 4.03 min, and 34.33 min to 3.50 min, 2.60 min, and 30.87 min, respectively, patients' satisfaction increased from 66.7% to 93.3%, and the cost of personal protective equipment (PPE) decreased from 46.67 sets and 186.6 CNY per day to 36.17 sets and 144.6 CNY, with statistical significance. Conclusion: The optimization of the intravenous infusion workflow can effectively decrease the satisfaction.	0
389	"Emerging and re emerging RNA viruses occasionally cause epidemics and pandemics worldwide, such as the on going outbreak of coronavirus SARS CoV 2. Existing direct acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2.
Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knocking out cells. We also proposed the drug combination of DAA and HTA was a promising strategy for anti virus treatment and proved that S312 showed more advantageous than Oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals. Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an EC50 of 17nM and SI value >5882 in SARS CoV 2 infected cells so far. This work demonstrates that both our self designed candidates and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno repression may have clinical potentials not only to influenza but also to"	0
390	The peak of the daily new infections in COVID 19 remained qualitative in description and elusive in arrival. Because of the lack of clarity in what to expect from the peak, apart from the hope that one day the peak will be reached, there has been no metric to describe the success of the implemented strategies. We propose a way of predicting the number of infections that can be expected after a lockdown, assuming they come from the asymptomatic cases prior to the lockdown and using linear response theory. These predictions for several western countries faithfully follow the observed weeks after the lockdown, suggesting universalities in the recovery pattern of several countries. At the same time, the gap between the quantitative predictions of the recovery patterns for New York and Milan and the observations is striking. These gaps which arise even while emulating the recovery patterns of other western countries raise the possibility of an audit of the success of the implemented strategies, and the potential newer sources of infection.	1

392	"Background: As the novel coronavirus triggering COVID 19 has broken out in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly worldwide, it threatens the lives of thousands of people and poses a global threat on the economies of the entire world. However, infection with COVID 19 is currently rare in children. Objective: To discuss the latest findings and research focus on the basis of characteristics of children confirmed with COVID 19, and provide an insight into the future treatment and research direction. Methods: We searched the terms ""COVID 19 OR coronavirus OR SARS CoV 2"" AND ""Pediatric OR children"" on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, NIH, CDC, and CNKI. The authors also reviewed the guidelines published on Chinese CDC and Chinese NHC. Results: We included 25 published literature references related to the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, accessary examination, treatment, and prognosis of pediatric patients with COVID 19. Conclusion: The numbers of children with COVID 19 pneumonia infection are small, and most of them come from family aggregation. Symptoms are mainly mild or even asymptomatic, which allow children to be a risk factor for transmission. Thus, strict epidemiological history screening is needed for early diagnosis and segregation. This holds especially for infants, who are more susceptible to infection than other age groups in pediatric age, but have most likely subtle and unspecific symptoms. They need to be paid more attention to.

Therefore, early chest CT examination combined with pathogenic detection is a recommended clinical diagnosis scheme in children. The risk factors which may suggest severe or critical progress for children are: Fast respiratory rate and/or; lethargy and drowsiness mental state and/or; lactate progressively increasing and/or; imaging showed bilateral or multi lobed infiltration, pleural effusion or rapidly expending of lesions in a short period of time and/or; less than 3 months old or those who underly diseases. For those critical pediatric patients with positive SARS CoV 2 diagnosis, polypnea may be the most common symptom. For treatment, the elevated PCT seen in children in contrast to adults suggests that the underlying coinfection/secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients and appropriate antibacterial treatment should be considered. Once cytokine storm is found in these patients, anti autoimmune or blood purifying therapy should be given in time. Furthermore, effective isolation measures and appropriate psychological comfort need to be provided timely."	0

395	"Background Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 aims to ""ensure healthy lives and promote well being for all at all ages"". While a substantial effort has been made to quantify progress towards SDG3, less research has focused on tracking spending towards this goal. We used spending estimates to measure progress in financing the priority areas of SDG3, examine the association between outcomes and financing, and identify where resource gains are most needed to achieve the SDG3 indicators for which data are available.
We estimated domestic health spending, disaggregated by source (government, out of pocket, and prepaid private) from 1995 to 2017 for 195 countries and territories. For disease specific health spending, we estimated spending for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis for 135 low income and middle income countries, and malaria in 106 malaria endemic countries, from 2000 to 2017. We also estimated development assistance for health (DAH) from 1990 to 2019, by source, disbursing development agency, recipient, and health focus area, including DAH for pandemic preparedness. Finally, we estimated future health spending for 195 countries and territories from 2018 until 2030. We report all spending estimates in inflation adjusted 2019 US$, unless otherwise stated.
been the health focus area to receive the highest contribution since 2004. In 2019, $374 million of DAH was provided for pandemic preparedness, less than 1% of DAH. Although spending has increased across HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria since 2015, spending has not increased in all countries, and outcomes in terms of prevalence, incidence, and per capita spending have been mixed. The proportion of health spending from pooled sources is expected to increase from 81·6% (81·6 81·7) in 2015 to 83·1% (82·8 83·3) in 2030.
Interpretation Health spending on SDG3 priority areas has increased, but not in all countries, and progress towards meeting the SDG3 targets has been mixed and has varied by country and by target. The evidence on the scale up of spending and improvements in health outcomes suggest a nuanced relationship, such that increases in spending do not always results in improvements in outcomes. Although countries will probably need more resources to achieve SDG3, other constraints in the broader health system such as inefficient allocation of resources across interventions and populations, weak governance systems, human resource shortages, and drug shortages, will also need to be addressed."	0

397	"COVID 19, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID 19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID 19 severity.
This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5 th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID 19 infection or ICU admission.
Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID 19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04).
Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83  7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICUadmitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2. 44  16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56  48.2).

Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64  7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22  5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity.
Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high risk of severe illness with COVID 19."	0
398	Initial projections from the first generation of COVID 19 models focused public attention on worst case scenarios in the absence of decisive policy action. These underscored the imperative for strong and immediate measures to slow the spread of infection. In the coming weeks, however, as policymakers continue enlisting models to inform decisions on COVID 19, answers to the most difficult and pressing policy questions will be much more sensitive to underlying uncertainties. In this study, we demonstrate a model based approach to assessing the potential value of reducing critical uncertainties most salient to COVID 19 decision making and discuss priorities for acquiring new data to reduce these uncertainties. We demonstrate how information about the impact of non pharmaceutical interventions could narrow prediction intervals around hospitalizations over the next few weeks, cases could narrow prediction intervals around the timing and height of the peak of the epidemic.	1
399	We propose a Gauss model (GM), a map from time to the bell shaped Gauss function to model the deaths per day and country, as a quick and simple model to make predictions on the coronavirus epidemic. Justified by the sigmoidal nature of a pandemic, i.e. initial exponential spread to eventual saturation, we apply the GM to existing data, as of April 2, 2020, from 25 countries during first corona pandemic wave and study the model's predictions. We find that logarithmic daily fatalities caused by Covid 19 are well described by a quadratic function in time. By fitting the data to second order polynomials from a statistical χ 2  fit with 95% confidence, we are able to obtain the characteristic parameters of the GM, i.e. a width, peak height and time of peak, for each country separately, with which we extrapolate to future times to make predictions. We provide evidence that this supposedly oversimplifying model might still have predictive power and use it to forecast the further course of the fatalities caused by Covid 19 per country, including peak number of deaths per day, date of peak, and duration within most deaths occur. While our main goal is to present the general idea of the simple modeling process using GMs, we also describe possible estimates for the number of required respiratory machines and the duration left until the number of infected will be significantly reduced. * Corresponding author † Electronic address: rsch@tp4.ruhr uni bochum.de ‡ Electronic address: mk@mat.ethz.ch § We submitted the first version to medRxiv.org (MEDRXIV/2020/055830) on April 5, 2020.

400	"No, they cant. Exponentially growing dynamics are intrinsically unpredictable. The time at which the number of infected individuals starts decreasing cannot be reliably calculated before it is actually attained. A standard SIR model with confinement shows that infection spread is inhibited only above a threshold. Confinement induces a slow down in the expansion phase that does not guarantee an eventual control of the epidemic. A Bayesian fit to the on going COVID 19 pandemic in Spain shows that we can infer neither its peaking time nor whether there is a peak at all. The dispersion of possible trajectories grows extremely fast, yielding a short horizon for reliable prediction. As unpredictability is intrinsic, not due to incomplete or wrong data, our study advocates for a scenario of probabilistic forecasting.

404	Coronaviruses are a famous family of viruses that causes illness in human or animals. The new type of coronavirus COVID 19 disease was firstly discovered in Wuhan China. However, recently, the virus has been widely spread in most of the world countries and is reported as a pandemic. Further, nowadays, all the world countries are striving to control the coronavirus disease COVID 19. There are many mechanisms to detect the coronavirus disease COVID 19 including clinical analysis of chest CT scan images and blood test results. The confirmed COVID 19 patient manifests as fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Particularly, several techniques can be used to detect the initial results of the virus such as medical detection Kits. However, such devices are incurring huge cost and it takes time to install them and use. Therefore, in this paper, a new framework is proposed to detect coronavirus disease COVID 19 using onboard smartphone sensors. The proposal provides a low cost solution, since most of the radiologists have already held smartphones for different daily purposes. People can use the framework on their smartphones for the virus detection purpose. Today's smartphones are powerful with existing computationrich processors, memory space, and large number of sensors including cameras, microphone, temperature sensor, inertial sensors, proximity, colour sensor, humidity sensor, and wireless chipsets/sensors. The designed Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled framework reads the smartphone sensors' signal measurements to predict the grade of severity disease.	0

Lesions were multifocal, frequently centered on terminal bronchioles, and consisted of minimal to marked, interstitial pneumonia, characterized by thickening of alveolar septae by edema fluid and fibrin and small to moderate numbers of macrophages and fewer neutrophils. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIH and carried out by certified staff in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International accredited facility, according to the institution’s guidelines for animal use, and followed the guidelines and basic principles in the United States Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. In the first experiment, the efficacy of prophylactic remdesivir treatment was tested in one group of six rhesus macaques (all males; female rhesus macaques were not available from the supplier at the time of this study) treated with 5 mg/kg remdesivir in vehicle solution (5 mg/mL 12% sulfobutylether β cyclodextrin in water and hydrochloric acid, pH3.5) and three control rhesus macaques (all males) who received the same volume (1 mL/kg) of vehicle solution.	0
407	"Although the SARS CoV 2 viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used for novel coronavirus disease diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum SARS CoV 2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the COVID 19 patients. However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients.
This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID 19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Dia gnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL 6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real time RT PCR Ct value.
The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL 6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10 folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL 6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID 19 patients (R=  0.682).
Serum SARS CoV 2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID 19 patients.
Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL 6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response. All rights reserved.

414	200 22 Main (MAX): 2,584 23 24 15 Abstract 25 Background: In Korea, a total of 8,799 confirmed cases of COVID 19 including 102 deaths have been 26 recorded as of Mar 21, 2020. The time delay adjusted case fatality risk of COVID 19 in Korea is yet to be 27 estimated. 28 29 Methods: We obtained the daily series of confirmed cases and deaths in Korea reported prior to March 21, 30 2020. Using statistical methods, we estimated the time delay adjusted risk for death from COVID 19 in the 31 city of Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk do, other regions in Korea, as well as for the entire country. 32 33 Results: Our model based crude CFR fitted the observed data well throughout the course of the epidemic 34 except for the very early stage in Gyeongsangbuk do, partially due to the reporting delay. Our estimates of 35 the risk for death in Gyeongsangbuk do reached 2.4% (95% CrI: 1.6 3.4%), 1.3% (95% CrI: 1.0 1.6%) in 36 Daegu and 0.7% (95% CrI: 0.3 1.4%) in other regions, whereas the national estimate of the risk for death 37 was estimated at 1.4% (95% CrI: 1.2 1.7%) in Korea. 38 39 Conclusions: The relatively low CFRs are associated with the early implementation of public health 40 interventions including widespread testing, social distancing, and delayed school openings in Korea. 41 Geographic differences 43	0
415	"Objective Since December 2019, coronavirus disease (COVID 19) emerged in Wuhan. However, the characteristics and risk factors associated with disease severity, unimprovement and mortality are unclear.
Methods All consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID 19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11 to February 6, 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study.
Results A total of 663 COVID 19 patients were included in this study. Among those, 247 (37.3%) had at least one kind of chronic disease. A total of 0.5% (n=3) of patients were diagnosed with mild COVID 19, while 37.8% (251/663), 47.5% (315/663), and 14.2% (94/663) were in moderate, severe, and critical condition, respectively. In our hospital during follow up, 251 of 663 (37.9%) patients were improved and 25 patients died, leading to a mortality rate of 3.77%. Older patients (>60 years old) and those with chronic diseases were prone to have severe and critical COVID 19 conditions, show unimprovement, and die (P < 0.001, < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified being male (OR = 0.486, 95% CI 0.311 0.758; P = 0.001), having severe COVID 19 conditions (OR = 0.129, 95% CI 0.082 0.201; P < 0.001), expectoration (OR = 1.796, 95% CI 1.062 3.036; P = 0.029), muscle ache (OR = 0.309, 95% CI 0.153 0.626; P = 0.001), and decreased albumin (OR = 1.929, 95% CI 1.199 3.104; P = 0.007) were associated with unimprovement in COVID 19 patients.
Conclusion Being male, in severe COVID 19 conditions, expectoration, muscle ache, and decreased albumin were independent risk factors which influence the improvement of COVID 19 patients."	0

417	"The ripple effect of the COVID 19
outbreak could potentially bring major challenges to worldwide health
systems and have far reaching consequences on the global economy if
the spread of the virus is not effectively controlled.1,2,4
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are relatively large viruses containing a single stranded
positive sense RNA genome encapsulated within a membrane envelope. Favipiravir, a purine nucleoside
leading to inaccurate viral RNA synthesis,36 was originally developed by Toyama Chemical of Japan, and has recently
been approved for a clinical trial as a drug to treat COVID 19.30 Chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, has proven
effective in treating coronavirus in China.32 In addition to the above mentioned, many other antiviral drugs are
also listed. Patients admitted to an ICU had higher concentrations
of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, particularly G CSF, IP 10/CXCL10,
MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), and TNFα, as well
as elevated cytokines from T helper 2 cells such as IL 4 and IL 10.44 Patent application WO2005058815 discloses human
anti IP 10 antibodies, including bispecific molecules and immunoconjugates
that bind to IP 10 with high affinity, for treating inflammation,
autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, bacterial infection,
and viral infection. In addition, DC SIGN/CD209,
a type II transmembrane adhesion molecule with C type lectin function,
is mainly expressed on interstitial dendritic cells and lung alveolar
macrophages.45 DC SIGN functions as an
entry cofactor in transferring SARS CoV to susceptible cells such
as pneumocytes.46 Patent application WO200505824
claims the production of a humanized anti DC SIGN antibody that interfered
with the interaction of DC SIGN with its receptor, ICAM 3. Recently, Generex announced that
it is developing a COVID 19 vaccine following a contractual agreement
with a Chinese consortium comprised of China Technology Exchange,
Beijing Zhonghua Investment Fund Management, Biology Institute of
Shandong Academy of Sciences, and Sinotek Advocates International
Industry Development. New Zealand white rabbits
immunized with MERS CoV mRNA vaccine encoding
the full length S protein reduced more than 90% of the viral load
in the lungs of the rabbits and induced a significant amount of neutralizing
antibody against MERS CoV. Moderna announced on February 24, 202055 that it has released the first batch of mRNA 1273
against SARS CoV 2 for use in humans, prepared using methods and strategies
outlined in their previous patents. The abundance of publications and the
rapid publication rate associated with the SARS CoV 2 virus related
disease outbreak, as illustrated in this report, are indicative
of the intense effort by research institutes and pharmaceutical
industries to address both molecular mechanisms and therapeutic routes
useful for treating current and future coronavirus outbreaks."	0
418	"The threat of the COVID 19 pandemic of SARS CoV 2 virus has grown since its start late last year. A customary response to a surge of a communicable disease is to separate healthcare systems into cohorts, such that patients with other conditions can be treated safely without risk of infection. A challenge with COVID 19 is the existence of currently asymptomatic infections, which without aggressive testing and isolation might enter the non COVID 19 cohort either through unknowingly infected patients or health care workers. Using stochastic simulations we study the impacts of testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. In the base case without testing or PPE, healthcare is rapidly overwhelmed, and becomes a net contributor to the force of infection. We find that effective use of PPE by both HCW and patients can prevent this situation, while testing alone is less effective. We also find that even imperfectly effective use of PPE can provide substantial protection and decrease the force of infection. This illustrates the importance of maintaining supplies of PPE throughout healthcare systems.
We consider a basic transmission model. The model has two major components: transmission within the broader community, and transmission within a cohort of HCWs and patients who are initially not infected with SARS CoV 2, that is, the non COVID 19 cohort.
The specific details of our simulations are described in the Appendix. The simulations are scripted in Python (scripts can be found herehttps://github.com/joelmiller/ HospitalCOVID19). What follows is a broad overview of the model structure. We assume that the broader community follows deterministic dynamics, described by a system of ordinary differential equations.

420	"Background: There is substantial disagreement about the level of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) infection in a population. The disagreement results, in part, from the interpretation of studies that report a proportion of asymptomatic people with SARS CoV 2 detected at a single point. Review questions: 1. Amongst people who become infected with SARS CoV 2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? 2. Amongst people with SARS CoV 2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? 3. What proportion of SARS CoV 2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection, or pre symptomatic?
Methods: Rapid living systematic review (protocol https://osf.io/9ewys/). We searched Pubmed, Embase, bioRxiv and medRxiv using a living evidence database of SARS CoV 2 literature on 25.03.2020. We included studies of people with SARS CoV 2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT PCR) that documented follow up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow up and modelling studies. Study selection, data extraction and bias assessment were done by one reviewer and verified by a second, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. We used a common effect model to synthesise proportions from comparable studies.
Results: We screened 89 studies and included 11. We estimated an upper bound for the proportion of asymptomatic SARS CoV 2 infections of 29% (95% confidence interval 23 to 37%) in eight studies.
Selection bias and likely publication bias affected the family case investigation studies. One statistical modelling study estimated the true proportion of asymptomatic infections at 18% (95% credibility interval 16 to 20%). Estimates of the proportions of pre symptomatic individual in four studies were too heterogeneous to combine. In modelling studies, 40 60% of all SARS CoV 2 infections are the result of transmission from pre symptomatic individuals, with a smaller contribution from"	0
421	Amid the coronavirus disease pandemic, humanity experiences a rapid increase in infection numbers across the world. A challenge hospitals are faced with, in the fight against the virus, is the effective screening of incoming patients. One methodology is the assessment of chest radiography (CXR) images, which usually requires expert radiologists' knowledge. In this paper, we propose an explainable deep neural networks (DNN) based method for automatic detection of COVID 19 symptoms from CXR images, which we call 'DeepCOVIDExplainer'. We used 16,995 CXR images across 13,808 patients, covering normal, pneumonia, and COVID 19 cases. CXR images are first comprehensively preprocessed, before being augmented and classified with a neural ensemble method, followed by highlighting class discriminating regions using gradient guided class activation maps (Grad CAM  ) and layer wise relevance propagation (LRP). Further, we provide human interpretable explanations of the predictions. Evaluation results based on hold out data show that our approach can identify COVID 19 confidently 1 with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89.61% and recall of 83%, improving over recent comparable approaches. We hope that our findings will be a useful contribution to the fight against COVID 19 and, in more general, towards an increasing acceptance and adoption of AI assisted applications in the clinical practice.	0
422	Since December 2019, cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) have been emerging in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and the epidemic has swiftly spread to other parts of China and beyond.1 As of February 25, there were a total of 77 779 cases of diagnosed COVID 19, 2824 cases of suspected COVID 19, 27 361 cured cases, and 2666 deaths from it in China, and there were 2464 cases of diagnosed COVID 19, 189 cured cases, and 43 deaths outside China. For these reasons, Chinese researchers strongly recommend CT imaging as the main basis for the diagnosis of COVID 19 in the current situation.4 An academician of the American Society for Radiation Oncology called for the immediate establishment of a CT based diagnostic method for COVID 19 and improvement of the detection rate of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2).5 If a patient with clinically suspected COVID 19 has negative NAAT results but positive imaging possible.	0
423	As the infection of 2019 nCoV coronavirus is quickly developing into a global pneumonia epidemic, the careful analysis of its transmission and cellular mechanisms is sorely needed. In this Communication, we first analyzed two recent studies scale data sets using state of theart bioinformatics methods and databases, presents clear evidence that rebuts these conclusions. Next, using metagenomic samples from Manis javanica, we assembled a draft genome of the 2019 nCoV like coronavirus, which shows 73% coverage and 91% sequence identity to the 2019 nCoV genome. In particular, the alignments of the spike surface glycoprotein receptor binding domain revealed four times more variations in the bat coronavirus RaTG13 than in the Manis coronavirus compared with 2019 nCoV, suggesting the pangolin as a missing link in the transmission of 2019 nCoV from bats to human.	1

425	In the lung, damage to the epithelia that cover the conducting airways and alveoli may lead to an inflammatory storm and progressive diseases, including bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), as well as respiratory infections such as the recent coronavirus COVID 19 in China [2]. In the bronchoalveolar duct junction, bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs), characterized by coexpression of secretoglobin family 1A member 1 (Scgb1a1, also known as CCSP, CCPBP, CC10, or CC16) and Sftpc, were demonstrated to be capable of repairing alveolar epithelia and distal airway epithelia [20, 21].	1
426	On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization was notified about a cluster of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in the city of Wuhan, China. Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019 nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human to human transmission of 2019 nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R 0 , to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4 3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human to human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARS CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. These findings underline the importance of heightened screening, surveillance and control efforts, particularly at airports and other nCoV.	0
427	"and Executive Summary  When it comes to pandemics such as the currently present COVID 19 [1], various issues and problems arise for infrastructures and institutions. Due to possible extreme effects, such as hospitals potentially running out of beds or medical equipment, it is essential to lower the infection rate to create enough space to attend to the affected people and allow enough time for a vaccine to be developed. Unfortunately, this requires that measures put into place are upheld long enough to reduce the infection rate sufficiently.
In this paper, we describe research simulating the influences of the contact rate on the spread of the pandemic using New York City as an example (Section IV) and especially already observed effects of contact rate increases during holidays [2 4] (Section V). In multiple simulations scenarios for Passover and Easter holidays, we evaluated 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% temporary increases in contact rates using a scenario close to the currently reported numbers as reference and contact rates based on bioterrorism research as a ""normal"" baseline for NYC.
The first general finding from the simulations is that singular events of increased visits/contacts amplify each other disproportionately if they are happening in close proximity (time intervals) together. The second general observation was that contact rate spikes leave a permanently increased and devastating infection rate behind, even after the contact rate returns to the reduced one. In case of a temporary sustained increase of contact rate for just three days in a row, the aftermath results in an increase of infection rate up to 40%, which causes double the fatalities in the long run.
In numbers, given that increases of 25% and 50% seem to be most likely given the data seen in Germany for the Easter weekend for example [2, 3], our simulations show the following increases (compared to the realistic reference run): for a temporary 25% surge in contact rate, the total cases grew by 215,880, the maximum of required hospitalizations over time increased to 63,063, and the total fatalities climbed by 8,844 accumulated over 90 days. As for the 50% surge, we saw the total number of cases rise by 461,090, the maximum number of required hospitalizations increase to 79,733, and the total number of fatalities climb by 19,125 over 90 days in NYC.
All in all, we conclude that even very short, temporary increases in contact rates can have disproportionate effects and result in unrecoverable phenomena that can hardly be reversed or managed later. The numbers show possible phenomena before they might develop effects in reality. This is important because phenomena such as the described blip can impact the hospitals in reality. Therefore, we warn that a wave of infections due to increased contact rates during Passover/Easter might come as a result!"	0

433	"Background Patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease have different degrees of psychological pain, such as anxiety and depression, which may related to their prognosis. Psychological intervention can be conducted in different ways to improve psychological pain and improve the treatment effect.
Objective The present study aimed to investigate and analyze the psychological status of patients with COVID 19 during the course of illness, and to evaluate the effect and influencing factors of psychological crisis intervention, so as to explore the effective mode of clinical psychological intervention in acute patients under isolation environment.
Methods A total of 143 persons participated in the study, including 26 patients diagnosed with COVID 19 in the isolation ward (COVID 19 group), 87 patients with general pneumonia in the observation ward (General Pneumonia group) and 30 healthy volunteers (Normal group). All the patients in the ward received comprehensive psychological intervention, including telephone psychological counseling (active and passive), self adjustment of written materials and one to one psychological crisis intervention. Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) and Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) were used to evaluate the mental health status of all patients on the day of admission and 1 week after treatment.
Results The scores of HAMA and HAMD of all patients (including isolation ward and observation ward) were significantly higher than the healthy volunteers at the time of admission. The total score of HAMA and HAMD in CVOID 19 group were both higher than that General Pneumonia group. After 1 week`s hospitalization with comprehensive psychological intervention, the scores of HAMA and HAMD in CVOID 19 group were significantly decreased.
Conclusion Patients those who diagnosed with COVID 19 in the isolation ward and/or general pneumonia in observation ward have different degrees of anxiety, depression and sleep problems. While receiving antiviral treatment, patients also need effective."	0

437	Face mask use by the general public for limiting the spread of the COVID 19 pandemic is controversial, though increasingly recommended, and the potential of this intervention is not well understood. We develop a compartmental model for assessing the communitywide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID 19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID 19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non pharmaceutical measures. Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17 45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34 58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24 65% (and peak deaths 15 69%), compared to 2 9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9 18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non pharmaceutical practices (such as social distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation wide) and compliance is high.	0

441	"This is a preprint version, not peer reviewed yet, and readers should treat it accordingly. 2 Summary Background: The COVID 19 disease has turned into a global pandemic with unprecedented challenges for the global community. Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to underestimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling in real time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020.
We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the state of the disease based on existing data. Building on the generic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) framework we incorporate two behavioral and logistical considerations. First we capture the endogenous changes in contact rate (average contact per person) as more death are reported. As a result the reproduction number changes endogenously in the model. Second we differentiate reported and true cases by including simple formulations for how only a fraction of cases might be diagnosed, and how that fraction changes in response to epidemic's progression. In estimating the model we use both the official data as well as the discovered infected travelers and unofficial medical community estimates and triangulate these sources to build a more complete picture. Calibration is completed by forming a likelihood function for observing the actual time series data conditional on model parameters, and conducting a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The model is used to estimate current ""true"" cases of infection and death. We analyze the future trajectory of the disease under six conditions related to the seasonal effects and policy measures targeting social distancing.
The model closely replicates the past data but also shows the true number of cases is likely far larger. We estimate about 493,000 current infected cases (90% CI: 271K 810K) as 1 A Persian summary of the article is provided as an appendix. ‫است‬ ‫موجود‬ ‫انتها‬ ‫ضمیمه‬ ‫در‬ ‫فارسی‬ ‫به‬ ‫مقاله‬ ‫خالصه‬"	0
442	"Background: Since the 2019 nCoV outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing every day, and a large number of populations all over the world are at risk. The quarantine and traffic blockage can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections, henceforth evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self isolation and quarantine.
We collected confirmed case data and the migration data, and introduced the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor to the Flow SEIR model. By varying the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor, we simulated the change of the peak number and arrival time of infections, then the efficacy of these two intervation measures can be analyzed in our simulation. In our study, the self protection at home is also included in quarantine.
In the simulated results, the quarantine and traffic blockage are effective for epidemic control. For Hubei province, the current quarantine factor is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who had flowed out from Hubei. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26. With the quarantine and traffic blockage factor increasing, the number of infections decrease dramatically. We also simulated the start dates of quarantine and traffic blockage at four time points, the simulated results show that the early of warning is also effective for epidemic containing.
However, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06%  22.38% of the peak number of infections. In general, the quarantine is much more effective than the traffic blockage control."	0

A S I P J o u r n a l C M E P r o g r a m Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious viral disease characterized by severe clinical manifestations of the lower respiratory tract. The pathogenesis of SARS is highly complex, with multiple factors leading to severe injury in the lungs and dissemination of the virus to several other organs. The SARS coronavirus targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract , resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness , including mucosal cells of the intestines , tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys , neurons of the brain , and several types of immune cells , and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury. Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS , explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes , and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms. The latter include dysregulation of cytokines/ chemokines , deficiencies in the innate immune response , direct infection of immune cells , direct viral cytopathic effects , down regulation of lung protective angiotensin converting enzyme 2 , autoimmunity , and genetic factors. It seems that both abnormal immune responses and injury to immune disease.	0

Establishing immunological memory in female piglets at a young age with PRCV was effective in inducing a secondary immune response to a limiting dose of virulent TGEV given orally 13 18 days prior to farrowing. Subsequently, because of passive antibody transfer, the offspring of these primed gilts were more efficient in surviving a lethal TGEV challenge. An average survival rate of 89% occurred in 6 litters of piglets from primed gilts that were boosted with 2.8 × 10 6 plaque forming units (PFU) of TGEV whereas 76% of the piglets survived in three litters that suckled primed gilts boosted with 3.0×10 5 PFU of TGEV. Non primed gilts given identical pre farrowing doses of TGEV had litter survival rates of 63 and 55%, respectively. Moreover, both groups of litters from primed gilts suffered less clinical illness (as measured by the extent of weight loss post challenge) than control litters. Priming of the piglets as neonates and boosting the pregnant gilts produced an anamnestic systemic immune response and correspondingly higher milk titers in the primed gilts compared to control animals. Thus, priming piglets with PRCV was beneficial in providing resistance to TGEV and could be incorporated into a vaccine strategy that yields better protection against TGEV."	0

Background: COVID 19 has emerged and spread at great speed globally and has presented one of the greatest public health challenges in modern times with no proven cure or vaccine.
Africa is still early in this epidemic, therefore the spectrum of disease severity is not yet clear.
We used a mathematical model to fit to the observed cases of COVID 19 in South Africa to estimate the basic reproductive number and critical vaccination coverages to control the disease for different hypothetical vaccine efficacy scenarios. We also estimated the percentage reduction in effective contacts due to the social distancing measures implemented.
: Early model estimates show that COVID 19 outbreak in South Africa had a basic reproductive number of 2.95 (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83 3.33). A vaccine with 70% efficacy had the capacity to contain COVID 19 outbreak but at very higher vaccination coverage 94.44% (95% Crl 92.44 99.92%) with a vaccine of 100% efficacy requiring 66.10% (95% Crl 64.72 69.95%) coverage. Social distancing measures put in place have so far reduced the number of social contacts by 80.31% (95% Crl 79.76 80.85%).
Conclusions: Findings suggest a highly efficacious vaccine would have been required to contain COVID 19 in South Africa. Therefore, the current social distancing measures to reduce contacts will remain key in controlling the infection in the absence of vaccines and other therapeutics."	0
449	"We give an update to the original paper posted on 2/17/20  now (as of 3/1/20) the China deaths are rapidly decreasing, and we find an exponential decline to the power law similar to the that predicted by the network model of Vazquez [2006]. At the same time, we see non China deaths increasing rapidly, and similar to the early behavior of the China statistics. Thus, we see three stages of the spread of the disease in terms of number of deaths: exponential growth, power law behavior, and then exponential decline in the daily rate.
(Original abstract) The novel coronavirus (COVID 19) continues to grow rapidly in China and is spreading in other parts of the world. The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models. Here we show that the current growth closely follows power law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease."	0

453	Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is a highly infectious, rapidly spreading viral disease with an alarming case fatality rate up to 5%. The risk factors for severe presentations are concentrated in patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) who are dialysis dependent. We report the first US case of a 56 year old nondiabetic male with ESRD secondary to IgA nephropathy undergoing thrice weekly maintenance hemodialysis for 3 years, who developed COVID 19 infection. He has hypertension controlled with angiotensin receptor blocker losartan 100 mg/day and coronary artery disease status post stent placement. During the first 5 days of his febrile disease, he presented to an urgent care, 3 emergency rooms, 1 cardiology clinic, and 2 dialysis centers in California and Utah. During this interval, he reported nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and low grade fevers but was not suspected of COVID 19 infection until he developed respiratory symptoms and was admitted to the hospital. Imaging studies upon admission were consistent with bilateral interstitial pneumonia. He was placed in droplet eye precautions while awaiting COVID 19 test results. Within the first 24 h, he deteriorated quickly and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation and increasing respiratory support. Losartan was withheld due to hypotension and septic shock. COVID 19 was reported positive on hospital day 3. He remained in critical condition being treated with hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in addition to the standard medical management for septic shock and ARDS. Our case is unique testing.	0

455	"syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has become a global threat to public health. Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID 19.
The records including demographics, RT PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT PCR or with CT were evaluated individually.
Besides, all the stool RT PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT PCR. Findings: Combination of RT PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT PCR alone (78.2% ， 68/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT PCR tests (86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT PCR and CT (kappa value, 0.430). In 34 COVID 19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID 19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs.
Interpretation: Combination of RT PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID 19. RT PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS CoV 2 infection. : medRxiv preprint person to person transmission of SARS CoV 2 in hospital and family settings 2,6,7 . As of February 17, 2020, more than 71,000 laboratory confirmed and 1,770 death cases have been documented in China and in other countries worldwide (including the USA, German, japan and South Korea) 8,9 . The mortality rate of SARS CoV 2 was around 2%. The WHO has recently declared the SARS CoV 2 a public health emergency of international concern 10 . Thus, diagnostic tests specific for this infection are urgently needed for confirming suspected cases, screening patients and conducting virus surveillance.
Identification of pathogens mainly includes virus isolation and viral nucleic acid detection.
According to the traditional Koch's postulates, virus isolation is the gold standard for virus diagnosis in the laboratory. Thus, based on SARS CoV 2 possesses a strong capability to infect humans, CDC recommends that clinical virology laboratories should not attempt viral isolation from specimens collected from COVID 19 patients under investigation. Because SARS CoV 2 is a newly discovered virus, the spectrum of the available diagnostic tools is tight. In the early stage, SARS CoV 2 has been detected in human clinical specimens by next generation sequencing, cell culture, and electron microscopy 11 .

Then the full genome sequence of SARS CoV 2 (29870 bp, excluding the poly (A) tail) in GenBank (accession number MN908947) was released quickly on January 10, 2020, which is more than 82% identical to those of SARS CoV and bat SARS like coronavirus (SL CoV) 12 . On the basis of analysis of this complete genomes obtained in this study, several laboratories developed molecular detection tools based on targeting ORF1ab, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene N, and E regions of viral spike genes [13][14][15] . And then the rapid identification of this novel coronavirus is attributed to recent advances in the detection of SARS CoV 2, including RT PCR, real time reverse transcription PCR (rRT PCR), reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT LAMP), and microarray based assays. At present, RT PCR is a widely used detection technique for SARS CoV 2 and several marketed nucleic acid detection kits for using in clinic 14 . Currently, the standard of reference for the COVID 19 pneumonia diagnosis is a positive result in nucleic acid detection assay for the upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and blood, respiratory tract specimens were including nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. And the patients confirmed with the COVID 19 pneumonia had 2 or 3 continuous negative RT PCR results for nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens can discharge from hospital. However, the scholar around china indicated that cases of COVID 19 that had 2 or 3 continuous negative RT PCR results for nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens before finally laboratory confirmed [13]. And currently, several reports has reported the positive RT PCR results for stool of COVID 19 patients 16,17 .

Results
The patients involved in this study summed 568, including 87 COVID 19 and 481 non COVID19.
All of them were the local residents of Wuhan, had a recent travel to Wuhan or contacted with people from Wuhan. And they were all eligible for the epidemiology criteria of suspected cases, and received further medical isolation, examination and diagnosis. Among the patients, 58.2% were males.
Throughout the whole spectrum of age, 15 59 years group generates 60.6% of all populations in this study, and 5.7% of patients were aged below 15 years (Table 1 ). In the disease severity, 83.9% (73 of 87 patients) were mild and 16.1% (14 of 87 patients)were severe.
In the early stage of COVID outbreak, RT PCR and CT scan were the main measure for screening SARS CoV 2 infection. Hence we collected the results of the two methods in the 568patints in further.
In the period of Jan 17 th to Feb 11 th , total 1674 specimen from the 568 patients were detected by RT PCR, which included 1415 pharyngeal and 259 stool (Table1). All patients after being admission received at least one RT PCR detection for pharyngeal swabs, and 341 patients were subjected to the second RTPCR test for pharyngeal swabs. The stool detected by RT PCR accounted to 259, 81 of which were from COVID 19 patients. Among the 568 patients, 364 patients were subjected to CT scan, .

The 568 cases being subjected to first RT PCR and second RT PCR for pharyngeal and 341 being subjected to CT scan were analyzed. The performance indexes were shown in Table1. The results showed that the sensitivity of RT PCR in parallel with CT scan was the highest( 91.9%), which was higher than that of parallel with second nucleic acid (86.2%) (Table1).
But the specificity of two nucleic acid detections was significantly higher than that of combination of nucleic acid and CT, suggesting that nucleic acid in parallel with CT was more appropriate to screen SARS CoV 22 infections, and two nucleic acid tests for exclusion diagnosis maybe more suitable.
It is reported that alive virus can survive in stool of COVID 19 patients. According our data, 8.6% patients (Table1) cannot be identified by combination of RT PCR for pharyngeal swab and CT scan.
Since that, can the RT PCR test for stool be an efficiency assisting examination? In this study, there were 75 COVID 19 cases subjecting to stool nucleotide detection. Therefore, all of the RT PCR results from 75 case with stool nucleotide detection were plotted along time axis (Figure3) . It was demonstrated that 35 cases had at least one positive results and the discovery rate is 46.7%. The stool presented earlier positive than the throat swab in two cases (patient No. 21, 38) (Figure3) . Moreover, pharyngeal swab of No.21 patient had been always negative until the end of the study. There were 16 patients with remaining positive results of stool after two consecutive negative results of pharyngeal swabs ( patient No.2,8,13,15,18,21,24,26,27,29,30,35,39,40,42,48) during their hospitalization (Figure3). Importantly, of the 14 discharged patients, two cases had stools being negative later than pharyngeal swabs (Patient No.2,10) (Figure3). The data above suggested that the detection of fecal nucleic acid could be employed to improve the discovery rate and might be developed as an indicator of monitoring and de isolation.

Timely and accurate diagnosis of the virus enables appropriate treatment of infections. RT PCR is widely deployed in diagnostic virology. In the case of a public health emergency, proficient diagnostic laboratories can rely on this robust technology to establish new diagnostic tests within their routine services before pre formulated assays become available.
In our study, the sensitivity of RT PCR was greater than that other reports (78% vs 30% 50%) in the first assay. The reasons for the high sensitivity of our series may include 26,27 : The first was samples, in some hospital, the patients' nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs were collected for testing the SARS CoV 2 separately. In our study, the detection specimen was the patient's pharyngeal and nasal swabs combine, compared to the pharyngeal or nasal swab only , indicating higher sensitivity at initial screening. We show that the strategy for the detection of viral RNA in pharyngeal and nasal swabs used for SARS CoV 2 diagnosis is not perfect. We also found that the virus are present in several stool swabs of patients when pharyngeal and nasal swabs detection negative. Based on the infected patients can potentially shed this pathogen through respiratory and fecal oral routes, we applied test for oral and stool swabs which could greatly improved detection positive rate.
Among the 87 laboratory confirmed cases, there were still 19 cases with RT PCR results testing negative in the first assay. In the false negatives can be caused by poor sample quality, such as respiratory tract samples collected from the oropharynx; collection that is too early or late in the progression of the disease, in the early stages, the number of viruses in the body is not enough to be .

detected. samples that have not been properly stored, transported, or processed, SARS CoV 2 coronavirus is RNA virus, which is prone to death and degradation. In the process of collecting samples and transporting them to the laboratory for testing, it takes a long time and the nucleic acid is easy to degrade, so it is not easy to detect positive. At last, technical factors, including virus mutation and PCR inhibition.
In our study, the sensitivity of RT PCR was higher than that of the chest CT (78.5% vs 66.7%, respectively). The reasons for the relatively lower efficiency of chest CT is may include, 1) The major of COVID 19 patients was mild, in the early detection, there is no features or typical features of chest CT in our study. 2) We divided three groups in the 365 patients, one group is COVID 19 positive, the other group is COVID 19 negative. Our results support RT PCR combine chest CT for first screening for COVID 19 for patients with clinical and epidemiologic features."	0

Determining the 3D structures of the proteins involved in host pathogen interactions are of great importance in the fight against infection. Besides, post translational modifications of the protein on 3D structure should be revealed in order to understand the protein function since these modifications are responsible for the host pathogen interaction. Based on these, we predicted O glycosylation and phosphorylation positions using full amino acid sequence of S1 protein. Candidate positions were further analyzed with enzyme binding activity, solvent accessibility, surface area parameters and the positions determined with high accuracy rate were used to design full 3D glycoprotein structure of the S1 protein using carbohydrate force field. In addition, the interaction between the C type lectin CD209L and α  mannose residues was examined and carbohydrate recognition positions were predicted. We suggest these positions as a potential target for the inhibition of the initial binding of SARS CoV 2 S1

457	"Background: Oseltamivir and zanamivir are recommended for treating and preventing influenza A (H1N1) worldwide. In Brazil, this official recommendation lacks an economic evaluation. Our objective was to assess the efficiency of influenza A chemoprophylaxis in the Brazilian context.
We assessed the cost effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir for prophylaxis of influenza for high risk population, compared to no prophylaxis, in the perspective of Brazilian public health system. Quality adjusted life years (QALY) and effectiveness data were based on literature review and costs in Brazilian real (BRL) were estimated from official sources and micro costing of 2016's H1N1 admissions at a university hospital. We used a decision tree model considering prophylaxis and no prophylaxis and the probabilities of H1N1, ambulatory care, admission to hospital, intensive care, patient discharge, and death. Adherence and adverse events from prophylaxis were included. Incremental cost effectiveness ratio was converted to 2016 United States dollar (USD). Uncertainty was assessed with univariated and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
Results: Adherence to prophylaxis was 0.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54; 0.83]; adverse events, 0.09 (95% CI 0.02; 0.18); relative risk of H1N1 infection in chemoprophylaxis, 0.43 (95% CI 0.33; 0.57); incidence of H1N1, 0.14 (95% CI 0.11; 0.16); ambulatory care, 0.67 (95% CI 0.58; 0.75); hospital admission, 0.43 (CI 95% 0.39; 0.42); hospital mortality, 0.14 (CI 95% 0.12; 0.15); intensive care unit admission, 0.23 (95% CI 0.20; 0.27); and intensive care mortality, 0.40 (95% CI 0.29; 0.52). QALY in H1N1 state was 0.50 (95% CI 0.46; 0.53); in H1N1 inpatients, 0.23 (95% CI 0.18; 0.28); healthy, 0.885 (95% CI 0.879; 0.891); death, 0. Adverse events estimated to affect QALY in  0.185 (95% CI  0.290;  0.050). Cost for chemoprophylaxis was BRL 39.42 [standard deviation (SD) 17.94]; ambulatory care, BRL 12.47 (SD 5.21); hospital admission, BRL 5,727.59 (SD 7,758.28); intensive care admission, BRL 19,217.25 (SD 7,917.33); and adverse events, BRL 292.05 (SD 724.95). Incremental cost effectiveness ratio was BRL  4,080.63 (USD  1,263.74)/QALY and  982.39 (USD  304.24)/H1N1 prevented. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis."	0

463	"A novel coronavirus pneumonia initially identified in Wuhan, China and provisionally named 2019 nCoV has surged in the public. In anticipation of substantial burdens on healthcare system following this human to human spread, we aim to scrutinise the currently available information and evaluate the burden of healthcare systems during this outbreak in Wuhan.
We applied a modified SIR model to project the actual number of infected cases and the specific burdens on isolation wards and intensive care units (ICU), given the scenarios of different diagnosis rates as well as different public health intervention efficacy. Our estimates suggest, assuming 50% diagnosis rate if no public health interventions were implemented, that the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported, with estimated 88,075 cases (as of 31 st January, 2020), and projected burdens on isolation wards and ICU would be 34,786 and 9,346 respectively The estimated burdens on healthcare system could be largely reduced if at least 70% efficacy of public health intervention is achieved.
The health system burdens arising from the actual number of cases infected by the novel coronavirus appear to be considerable if no effective public health interventions were implemented. This calls for continuation of implemented anti transmission measures (e.g., closure of schools and facilities, suspension of public transport, lockdown of city) and further effective large scale interventions spanning all subgroups of populations (e.g., universal : bioRxiv preprint  2  facemask wear) aiming at obtaining overall efficacy with at least 70% to system."	0
464	We report the dynamic change process of target genes by RT PCR testing of SARS Cov 2 during the course of a COVID 19 patient: from successive negative results to successive single positive nucleocapsid gene, to two positive target genes (orf1ab and nucleocapsid) by RT PCR testing of SARS Cov 2, and describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case. In this case, negative results of RT PCR testing was not excluded to diagnose a suspected COVID 19 patient, clinical signs and symptoms, other laboratory findings, and chest CT images should be taken into account for the absence of enough positive evidence. This case highlights the importance of successive sampling and testing SARS Cov 2 by RT PCR as well as the increased value of single positive target gene from pending to positive in two specimens to diagnose laboratory confirmed COVID 19.	0
465	The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) started in the end of 2019 in China has triggered a global public health crisis. Previous studies have shown that SARS CoV 2 infects cells by binding angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the same as SARS CoV. The expression and distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after SARS CoV 2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA seq and single cell RNA seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID 19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes. Our study revealed the phenomenon and possible cause of mild pancreatic injury in patients with COVID 19. This suggests that pancreatitis after work.	0
466	"Time dependent physiological data, such as electromyogram (EMG) recordings from multiple 15 muscles, is often difficult to interpret objectively. Here, we used EMG data gathered during mouse locomotion to investigate the effects of calculation parameters and data quality on two metrics for fractal analysis: the Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD) and the Hurst exponent (H).
A curve is fractal if it repeats itself at every scale or, in other words, if its shape remains unchanged when zooming in the curve at every zoom level. Many linear and nonlinear analysis 20 methods are available, each of them aiming at the explanation of different data features. In recent years, fractal analysis has become a powerful nonlinear tool to extract information from physiological data not visible to the naked eye. It can present, however, some dangerous pitfalls that can lead to misleading interpretations. To calculate the HFD and the H, we have extracted muscle synergies from normal and mechanically perturbed treadmill locomotion from the 25 hindlimb of adult mice. Then, we used one set per condition (normal and perturbed walking) of the obtained time dependent coefficients to create surrogate data with different fluctuations over the original mean signal. Our analysis shows that HFD and H are exceptionally sensitive to the presence or absence of perturbations to locomotion. However, both metrics suffer from variations in their value depending on the parameters used for calculations and the presence of 30 quasi periodic elements in the time series. We discuss those issues giving some simple suggestions to reduce the chance of misinterpreting the outcomes.
Higuchi's fractal dimension and the Hurst exponent. We expose and suggest how to solve the drawbacks of such methods when applied to data from normal and perturbed locomotion by combining in vivo recordings and computational approaches."	0

Here, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming (taxonomy) of the Coronaviridae family, assessed the novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019 nCoV. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS CoV 2/Isolate/Host/Date/Location. The spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS CoV 2 infections in humans remains to be determined. The independent zoonotic transmission of SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2 highlights the need for studying the entire (virus) species to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This research will improve our understanding of virus host interactions in an ever changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks. : bioRxiv preprint Defining novelty and the place of SARS CoV 2 within the taxonomy of the Coronaviridae family During the 21 st century, researchers studying coronaviruses  a family of enveloped positivestranded RNA viruses of vertebrates 8  were confronted several times with the question of coronavirus novelty, including two times when a severe or even life threatening disease was introduced into humans from a zoonotic reservoir: this happened with severe acute respiratory	0

471	"Based on available reports (up to the writing of this editorial) and on scientific data reported by China, Italy, and the United States, newborn infants appear to be significantly less affected by COVID 19 than adults. 1   3 However, the lack of high quality evidence for this situation and the steadfast pace of new and conflicting information has been an overall challenge to all medical specialties, including neonatal intensive care. In reality, the current knowledge on neonatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) infection is limited. Therefore, several questions remain unanswered, while at the same time the neonatal community needs to take action. Not surprisingly, this has caused significant stress amongst neonatal health care providers.

472	"Background: Antiviral therapies against the novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2, which has caused a global pandemic of respiratory illness called COVID 19, are still lacking.
Our study (NCT04252885, named ELACOI), was an exploratory randomized (2:2:1) controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or arbidol monotherapy for treating patients with mild/moderate COVID 19.
Findings: This study successfully enrolled 86 patients with mild/moderate COVID 19 with 34 randomly assigned to receive LPV/r, 35 to arbidol and 17 with no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable. The primary endpoints, the average time of positive to negative conversion of SARS CoV 2 nucleic acid and conversion rates at days 7 and 14, were similar between groups (all P>0.05). There were no differences between groups in the secondary endpoints, the rates of antipyresis, cough alleviation, or improvement of chest CT at days 7 or 14 (all P>0.05). At day 7, eight (23.5%) patients in the LPV/r group, 3 (8.6%) in the arbidol group and 2(11.8%) in the control group showed a deterioration in clinical status from moderate to severe/critical(P =0.206).

473	2019 nCoV is thought to be primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets with a similar incubation time and generation time as SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV).1,2 SARS was frightening at the time, maybe even more frightening compared to 2019 nCoV (now renamed COVID 19) given its much more frequent progression to severe disease and death. This public health practice was used widely in fourteenth century Italy, when ships arriving at the Venice port from plague infected ports had to anchor and wait for 40 days (in Italian: quaranta for 40) before disembarking their surviving passengers.5 Forty days provided ample time for the incubation time to be completed so that yet asymptomatic cases became symptomatic and could therefore be identified.	0

475	"A total of 100 (76%) patients had a history of close contact with people living in Wuhan, Hubei. The clinical manifestations of COVID 19 included cough, fever. Most of the lesions identified in chest CT images were multiple lesions of bilateral lungs, lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung, 109 (83%) patients had more than two lobes involved, 20 (15%) patients presented with patchy ground glass opacities, patchy ground glass opacities and consolidation of lesions co existing in 61 (47%) cases. Complications such as pleural thickening, hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were detected but only in rare cases. For the follow up chest CT examinations (91 cases), We found 66 (73%) cases changed very quickly, with an average of 3.5 days, 25 cases (27%) presented absorbed lesions, progression was observed in 41 cases (46%), 25 (27%) cases showed no significant changes.
Chest CT plays an important role in diagnosing COVID 19. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed consolidation is highly suspicious of COVID 19, that can quickly change over a short period of time."	0
476	"Reporting delays in disease surveillance impair the ability to assess the current dynamic of an epidemic. In continuously updated epidemic curves, case numbers for the most recent epidemic week or day usually appear to be lower than the previous, suggesting a decline of the epidemic. In reality, the epidemic curve may still be on the rise, because reporting delay prevents the most recent cases to appear in the case count. In context of the COVID 19 epidemic and for countries planning large international gatherings, such as the Summer Olympic Games in Japan 2020, the ability to assess the actual stage of an epidemic is of outmost importance.
We applied now casting onto COVID 19 data provided by the nCoV 2019 Data Working Group to evaluate the true count of cases, by taking into account reporting delays occurring between date of symptom onset and date of confirmation.
We calculated a decrease of reporting delay, from a median delay of ten days in calendar week four 2020 to six days in calendar week eight, resulting in an overall mean of 4.3 days. The confidence intervals of the now casting indicated an increase of cases in the last reporting days, while case country in that same time period suggested a decline.
As a specific use case this tool may be of particular value for the challenging risk assessment and risk communication in the context elsewhere."	0
477	"The quantification of COVID 19 infection in CT images using deep learning has not been investigated. Clinically there is no automatic tool to quantify the infection volume for COVID 19 patients. Purpose: To develop a deep learning (DL) based system for automatic segmentation and quantification of infection regions as well as the entire lung from chest CT scans. Materials and methods: The DL based segmentation employs the ""VB Net"" neural network to segment COVID 19 infection regions in CT scans. The system is trained using 249 COVID 19 patients, and validated using 300 new COVID 19 patients. To accelerate the manual delineation of CT images for training, a human in the loop (HITL) strategy is adopted to assist radiologists to refine automatic annotation of each case. To evaluate the performance of the DL based system, Dice similarity coefficient, the differences of volume and percentage of infection (POI) are calculated between automatic and manual segmentation results on the validation set. Results: The proposed system yielded Dice similarity coefficients of 91.6%±10.0% between automatic and manual segmentations, and a mean POI estimation error of 0.3% for the whole lung on the validation dataset. Moreover, compared with the cases of fully manual delineation that often takes 1 to 5 hours, the proposed human in the loop strategy can dramatically reduce the delineation time to 4 minutes after 3 iterations of model updating. Conclusion: A DL based segmentation system was developed to automatically segment and quantify infection regions in CT scans of COVID 19 patients. Quantitative evaluation showed high accuracy for automatic infection region delineation, POI metrics."	0

483	In an effort to identify the direct animal source of SARS CoV, SARS CoV related CoVs (SARS rCoV), which share 99.8% sequence homology at the nucleotide level with SARS CoV, were isolated in 2003 from workers working in a live animal market where animal meats were sold and from animals in the same market [28], including Himalayan palm civets and a raccoon dog. Although the exact mechanisms by which SARS CoV 2 might counteract host antiviral defence remain to be elucidated, this emerging virus is thought to be less pathogenic than SARS CoV. Our prediction is that the IFN antagonism of SARS CoV 2 and its ability to suppress other pathways of innate antiviral signalling might fall between those of SARS CoV and the community acquired HCoVs.	1
484	"Since the beginning of the outbreak in China, ending 2019, the Novel Coronavirus has spread subsequently to the rest of the world causing an ongoing pandemic. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID 19 ""a public health emergency of international concern."" Taking into consideration the lockdown and quarantine situation, a research team of doctors from the Hospital of Salamanca, decided to do an evaluation of the current emotional state on the general population with a webbased survey in English and in Spanish, which was considered a useful and fast method that could help us determine how people perceived stress and worry due to the COVID 19. Methods: The survey included a 22 items, gathering information in 3 sections: Sociodemographic data, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS 10) by Cohen and additional queries that assessed the current worry and change of behaviours due to this pandemic. Results: The survey received 1091 respondents from 41 countries, from March 17 to the 1 st of April, 2020. The mean age of the respondents was 43.1 (14.2) years old, and more than two thirds were women. 21.1% were health personnel. The mean of the PSS 10 score was 17.4 (6.4). Significantly higher scores were observed among women, youth, students, and among those who expressed concern and those who perceived increased susceptibility to the COVID 19. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between the health professionals and the general population. A weak correlation was observed between mean relative volume RSV of the last 28 days and the number of cases reported (rho = 0.31, p <0.001) and deaths (rho = 0.28, p <0.001). Discussion: With these results the researchers describe an increase of affective symptoms due to the COVID 19. This pandemic is raising the anxiety levels. The findings of the study show the affective and cognitive alterations people are going through. This survey is the first attempt to measure the psychological consequences this pandemic is having, in order to be able to provide the support to confront this global issue, addressing the mental health care that will be needed."	0
485	In order to quantitatively characterize the epidemic of COVID 19, useful relations among parameters describing an epidemic in general are derived based on the Kermack McKendrick model. The first relation is 1/τ grow =1/τ trans −1/τ inf , where τ grow is the time constant of the exponential growth of an epidemic, τ trans is the time for a pathogen to be transmitted from one patient to uninfected person, and the infectious time τ inf is the time during which the pathogen keeps its power of transmission. The second relation p(∞ ) ≈ 1− exp(− (R 0 − 1)/0.60) is the relation between p(∞ ), the final size of the disaster defined by the ratio of the total infected people to the population of the society, and the basic reproduction number, R 0 , which is the number of persons infected by the transmission of the pathogen from one infected person during the infectious time.

492	"The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID 19) outbreak as a pandemic on March 12, 2020. Within 3 1/2 months since outbreak in December 2019, over 1.3 million people have been infected across 206 countries with over 70,000 deaths. COVID 19 has a size of 60 140nm with mean size of the nano aerosols, 100nm. The virus can be airborne by attaching to human secretion (fine particles, nasal/saliva droplets) of infected person or suspended fine particulates in air. While NIOSH has standardized N95 and N98 at 300nm, to date there is no filter standards, nor special filter technologies, tailored for capturing airborne viruses and 100nm nano aerosols. The latter also are present in high number concentration in atmospheric pollutants. This study addresses developing novel charged PVDF nanofiber filter technology to effectively capture the deadly airborne coronavirus with our target set at 100nm (nano aerosol), and not 300nm.
The virus and its attached particle were simulated by sodium chloride aerosols, 50 500nm, generated from sub micron aerosol generator. PVDF nanofibers were produced with fiber diameters 84, 191, 349 and 525nm with excellent morphology. The fibers were subsequently charged by corona discharge.
The amounts of charged fibers in a filter were increased to achieve high efficiency of 90% for the virus filter but the electrical interference between neighbouring fibers resulted in progressively marginal increase in efficiency and concurrently much higher pressure drop across the filter. The quality factor which measured the efficiency to pressure drop kept decreasing. By redistributing the fibers in the filter into several modules, each separated by a permeable scrim material, the electrical interference was reduced, if not fully mitigated.
Also, the additional scrim materials introduced macropores into the filter that further reduced the airflow resistance. With this approach, the quality factor can maintain relatively constant with increasing fiber amounts to achieve high filter efficiency. The optimal amounts of fiber in each module depended on the diameter of fibers in the module. Small fiber diameter that has already high performance required small amount of fibers per module. In contrast, large diameter fiber required more amounts of fiber per module to compensate for the poorer performance without incurring higher pressure drop. This approach was applied to develop four new nanofiber filters tailored for capturing 100nm airborne COVID 19 to achieve over 90% efficiency with pressure drop below 30Pa (3.1mm water). One filter developed meeting the 90% efficiency has ultralow pressure drop of only 18Pa (1.9mm water) while another filter meeting the 30Pa limit has high efficiency reaching 94%. These optimized filters based on rigorous engineering approach provide the badly needed technology for protecting the general public from the deadly airborne COVID 19 and other viruses, and nano aerosols from air pollution which lead to chronic diseases. [5]. This does not exclude also the possibility of the virus being attached to fine particles in the respiratory track or mouth of the infected person and got aerosolized during coughing, sneezing, speech and vomiting [6]. The aerosolization of virus may be one of the several causes that explains the sustained person to person spread of the COVID 19 in the world in such a short period of time. Interestingly, other than practicing social distancing and washing hands to keep disinfected, people wearing facemasks and respirators in the Far East, a deep rooted tradition, seem to have better control on the spread of COVID 19 as compared to the West where facemasks and respirators are less commonly used. The global infection statistics in the past 3 1/2 months support strongly the essence of good filtration technology as a first line defence to the spread of the airborne virus.
The size of the COVID 19 has been determined under Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) to be 60 140nm, which averages to 100nm [7] . This is similar in size as the SARS coronavirus, which is also 100nm. The common influenza virus is 80 120nm, which average out to 100nm. As the virus can be attached to particulates less than 100nm, the smallest size for the COVID 19 and its carrier (droplet or particle) can still be about 100nm. Can our current filtration technology provide adequate protection filtering out the airborne 100nm aerosol? The 100nm aerosol has been referred to as nano aerosol, nanoparticle or ultrafine particle. While the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has standardized N95 and N98 respirator at 300nm, there is no standard filtration test for nanoaerosols at 100nm. The objective of the present study is to fill in this unmet need by developing effective new filtration technology target on this nano aerosol size (i.e. 100nm) that represents the average size of COVID 19, as well as any other viruses including common cold/flu viruses, SARS and MERS.
There is no standard on personal protection gear, such as facemask, on filtering 100nm, it can be safe to set an objective of this study being to develop a filter/mask that can provide at least 90% filtration efficiency for the 100nm nano aerosols but with pressure drop less than 30Pa at 5.3 cm/s face velocity. Subsequently, we can compare the outcome of this goal with that being set to filtering 300nm aerosols, which are well known in the NIOSH standard.
If the coronavirus is negatively charged, the positively charged PVDF nanofiber filter will provide even higher capture efficiency as well. Therefore, the results from the present investigation can be considered as conservative as only neutrally charged sodium chloride particles will be used in our tests.
On a separate front, it is well known that pollutants in the air contain harmful aerosols.
While a lot of attention has been on PM2.5, which is based on the standard set by the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 25m/m 3 of air. There is less attention drawn to the finer aerosols, in particularly the PM1 (<1 m) and PM0.1(<0.1 m). For sub micron aerosol PM1, the aerosols concentration should be measured by number concentration and they contribute very little to the PM2.5, which is based on the mass concentration. This applies more to the PM0.1, which is even smaller. Despite this, the high concentration of PM1 and more so the PM0.1 can penetrate deeply in our body [8] . Indeed, it has been reported nanoaerosols of 41nm were found in the erythrocyte in the capillary lumen and 81 nm particle in the cytoplasm of a capillary endothelial cell in the lung [9] . In fact, when nano aerosols enter the blood stream they can be transported to various organs, including to our central nervous system and even having adverse effect on our brain [8]. Indeed, nano aerosols are also present in large number concentrations, about 200 million per cubic meter, from road emission [10]. The target of protecting 100nm COVID 19 is also applicable for protecting wearer of face mask against 100nm aerosol pollutant from combustion emission (traffic, power plant, industries) as the number concentration around this size is extremely high, 200 million/m 3 [10]."	0

494	The inhibition of human angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) has been regarded as a promising approach for the treatment of hypertension. Despite research attempts over many years, our understanding the mechanisms of activation and inhibition molecular dynamics simulations of ACE with and without ligands. Two types of inhibitors, competitive and mixed non competitive, were used to model the ligand bound forms. In the absence of a ligand the simulation showed spontaneous large hinge bending motions of multiple conversions between the closed and open states of ACE, while the ligand bound forms were stable in the closed state. Our simulation results imply that the equilibrium between pre existing backbone conformations shifts in the presence of a ligand. The hinge bending motion of ACE is considered as an essential to the enzyme function. A mechanistic model of activation and the inhibition may provide valuable information for novel inhibitors of ACE.	1
495	Three problems with the Dutch government’s response to the COVID 19 outbreak are discussed below: (1) the objective pursued by the Dutch government in addressing the COVID 19 epidemic; (2) the delay in taking adequate response measures (travel restrictions, restrictions on social interactions); and (3) the lack of preparedness and transparency in addressing the outbreak.	1
496	As the global population increases and transportation connectivity improves in quality and prices, the demand for mobility increases, especially in long haul services. According to the 2017 report of the European Commission in Mobility and Transport, the performance of all modes for passenger transport (roadways and airways) are reaching record highs. Although the benefits of the increased demand for mobility are substantial and welcome, an effort should be paid such as to ameliorate possible threatening side effects that may also arise. As World Health Organization (WHO) denotes and as has been evident from the global COVID 19 epidemic outbreak, infectious diseases can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another under common exposure circumstances such as air transportation (especially long haul airline connections) that may act as the medium for transmitting and spreading infectious diseases. In this paper, analytical and realistic models have been integrated, for providing evidence on the spread dynamics of infectious diseases that may face Europe through the airlines system. In particular, a detailed epidemiological model has been integrated with the airlines' and land transport network, able to simulate the epidemic spread of infectious diseases originated from distant locations. Additionally, a wide set of experiments and simulations have been conducted, providing results from detailed stress tests covering both mild as well as aggressive cases of epidemic spreading scenarios. The results provide convincing evidence on the effectiveness that the European airports' system offer in controlling the emergence of epidemics, but also on the time and extent that controlling measures should be taken in order to break the chain of infections in realistic cases.	0

500	"A critical shortage of respirators, masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) exists across all sectors of society afflicted by the COVID 19 pandemic, placing medical staff and service workers at heightened risk and hampering efforts to reduce transmission rates. Of particular need are the N95 medical face respirators that filter 95% of all airborne particles at and above 0.3 μm in diameter, many of which use meltblown microfibers of charged polypropylene (e.g, the 3M TM 8200). An intensive search is underway to find reliable methods to lengthen the useful life of these normally disposable units.
It is currently believed that these masks and respirators cannot be cleaned with 70 to 75% alcohol water solutions, as past wet/dry experiments show that filtration efficiency can drop by ~40% after the first such treatment. This has been interpreted as the liquids disrupting the surface charge on the fibers and has led to a recent CDC/NIOSH advisory against using alcohol for their decontamination. We have replicated the drop in efficiency after alcohol treatment. However, we find that the efficiency can be recovered by more effective drying, which we achieve with a vacuum chamber. Drying at pressures of < ~6 mBar (0.6 kPa) restores the measured filtering efficiency to within 2% or so of the pre washing value, which we have sustained for 5 cleaning drying cycles so far in three models of N95 masks. The mechanism seems to be the removal of water molecules adsorbed on the fiber surfaces, a hypothesis which is supported by two independent observations: (A) the filtering efficiency increases non linearly with the weight loss during drying, and (B) filtration efficiency shows an abrupt recovery as the vacuum pressure drops from 13 to 6 mBar, the range physically attributable to the removal of adsorbed water. These results are not compatible with the electrostatic discharge hypothesis, and rather suggest that water molecules adsorbed to the fiber surface are reducing the filtration efficiency via surface tension interactions (e.g., wicking between the fibers and coating their surfaces with a film).
Such a degradation mechanism has two implications: (A) Respirators decontaminated by a soak in 70% v/v ethanol regain their filtration efficiency once they are fully dry. We employ vacuum chambers in this study, which are inexpensive and commonly available. (B) This mechanism presents the possibility that mask filtration performance may be subject to degradation by other sources of moisture, and that the mask would continue to be compromised even if it appears dry. The mask would need to be vacuum dried to restore its performance.
This study introduces a number of methods which could be developed and validated for use in resource limited settings. As the pandemic spreads to rural areas and developing nations, these would allow for local efforts to decontaminate, restore, monitor, and test medical masks."	0
501	Background: COVID 19 diagnosis is a critical problem, mainly due to the lack or delay in the test results. We aimed to obtain a model to predict SARS CoV 2 infection in suspected patients reported to the Brazilian surveillance system. Methods: We analyzed suspected patients reported to the National Surveillance System that corresponded to the following case definition: patients with respiratory symptoms and fever, who traveled to regions with local or community transmission or who had close contact with a suspected or confirmed case. Based on variables routinely collected, we obtained a multiple model using logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy indicators were used for validation. Results: We described 1468 COVID 19 cases (confirmed by RT PCR) and 4271 patients with other illnesses. With a data subset, including 80% of patients from Sao Paulo (SP) and Rio Janeiro (RJ), we obtained a function which reached an AUC of 95.54% (95% CI: 94.41%  96.67%) for the diagnosis of COVID 19 and accuracy of 90.1% (sensitivity 87.62% and specificity 92.02%). In a validation dataset including the other 20% of patients from SP and RJ, this model exhibited an AUC of 95.01% (92.51%  97.5%) and accuracy of 89.47% (sensitivity 87.32% and specificity 91.36%). Conclusion: We obtained a model suitable for the clinical diagnosis of COVID 19 based on routinely collected surveillance data. Applications of this tool include early identification for specific treatment and isolation, rational use of laboratory tests, and input for modeling epidemiological trends.	0
502	Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China began in December 2019. Studies on novel coronavirus disease (COVID 19) were less based on pediatric patients. This study aimed to reveal the clinical characteristics of COVID 19 in children. Method: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical symptoms, laboratory results, chest CT, and treatment of children with laboratory confirmed COVID 19(ie, with samples that were positive for 2019 novel coronavirus[2019 nCoV]) who were admitted to Result: Nine patients had no obvious clinical symptom. 11 patients developed fever. Other symptoms, including cough(in eleven of seventeen patients), rhinorrhea(in two), diarrhea(in two), vomiting(in two), were also observed. A small minority of patients had lymphocytopenia. Alanine transaminase or transaminase increased in three cases. According to chest CT scan, 11 patients showed unilateral pneumonia, 8 patients had no pulmonary infiltration. No serious complications such as acute respiratory syndrome and acute lung injury occurred in all patients. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019 nCoV infection in children were different from adult. The overall condition of children were mild and have a good prognosis.	0

This study relies on Google Trends data and tests whether the lockdowns implemented in Europe and America led to changes in well being related topic search terms. Using different methods to evaluate the causal effects of lockdown, we find a substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US.

The COVID 19 is the etiologic agent of a recently arose disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). Presently, there is no vaccine available against this emerged viral disease. Therefore, it is indeed a need of the hour to develop an effectual and safe vaccine against this decidedly pandemic disease.

512	A sudden outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) virus has happened since December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, a central city in the People’s Republic of China, where transportation is enormously convenient to connecting all other places in China and overseas [1, 2]. While epidemiologists working in centers for disease control and preventions provided the statistical results for the dissemination of epidemiological data correctly, and provide the well prepared datasets for the decision makers for coordination of necessary resources, and many health workers investigate the suspected contactors for quick medical quarantine of the suspected cases at the community level. The nature of high transmissibility for COVID 19 requires us to (i) prepare the battle globally as soon as possible, by taking the advantage of the time window opened by Chinese battle against COVID 19, (ii) invest more weapons or tools against the diseases by better global coordination, and (iii) take proper quarantine measures globally [16].	0
513	"Background On Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020.
Methods In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID 19 by semi quantitative RT PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the ), where RNA extraction, real time RT PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done.
The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS CoV 2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log 10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80 year old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80 year old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020.
Interpretation We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS CoV 2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies."	0
514	"Background: The average length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU_ALOS) is a helpful parameter summarizing critical bed occupancy. During the outbreak of a novel virus, estimating early a reliable ICU_ALOS estimate of infected patients is critical to accurately parameterize models examining mitigation and preparedness scenarios.
Methods: Two estimation methods of ICU ALOS were compared: the average LOS of already discharged patients at the date of estimation (DPE), and a standard parametric method used for analyzing time to event data which fits a given distribution to observed data and includes the censored stays of patients still treated in the ICU at the date of estimation (CPE). Methods were compared on a series of all COVID 19 consecutive cases (n=59) admitted in an ICU devoted to such patients. At the last follow up date, 99 days after the first admission, all patients but one had been discharged. A simulation study investigated the generalizability of the methods' patterns. CPE and DPE estimates were also compared to COVID 19 estimates reported to date. Findings: LOS ≥ 30 days concerned 14 out of the 59 patients (24%), including 8 of the 21 deaths observed. Two months after the first admission, 38 (64%) patients had been discharged, with corresponding DPE and CPE estimates of ICU_ALOS (95%CI) at 13.0 days (10.4 15.6) and 23.1 days (18.1 29.7), respectively. Series' true ICU_ALOS was greater than 21 days, well above reported estimates to date.
Interpretation: Discharges of short stays are more likely observed earlier during the course of an outbreak. Cautious unbiased ICU_ALOS estimates suggest parameterizing a higher burden of ICU bed occupancy than that adopted to date in COVID 19 forecasting models."	0

516	"currently sweeping the globe have often been described as 'equal opportunity infectors', implying little socioeconomic disparity in susceptibility. However, early data from the COVID 19 pandemic has underscored that the burden of respiratory viruses actually reflect and magnify existing socioeconomic inequalities. We review the literature on socioeconomic and racial disparities in acute respiratory infection (ARI), as well as ARI associated hospitalization and mortality. Our goal is to identify key principles of the relationship between socioeconomic inequality and ARI outcomes, as well as highlighting poorly understood areas that need to be addressed by research and policy in the wake of the COVID 19 pandemic. We find that there has been descriptive work in this area, but that there is a distinct lack of cohesive methodology in the literature exploring social determinants and ARI. We propose the fundamental cause theory is a useful framework for guiding future research of disparities in ARI and for the design of interventions to alleviate these disparities. : medRxiv preprint 3 associated morbidity and mortality resulting from comorbidities increasing the likelihood of severe disease, limited access to quality care and therapies (e.g. antivirals) once infected. ARI related disparities falling along these dimensions are evident at the within country level, and at the global scale:
A disproportionate amount of severe ARI related disease and death occurs in low and middle income countries (LMICs), with as much as 99% of in hospital deaths associated with RSV occurring in LMICs as of 2015 5 . In addition, a 15 fold difference in influenza associated case fatality has been observed between LMICs and wealthy countries 6 , underscoring how global inequality exacerbates the toll of death and disability attributable to ARI.
However, a persistent focus on biological dimension of infectiousness has reinforced the perception that that social inequality has little to do with the burden of ARI both domestically and globally. This perception dates back to the pioneering work of McKeown and Record, who ruled out standard of living disparities in ARI mortality in 19 th  century England and Wales because of their highly infectious and seasonal nature. As a result, the focus of research on the social determinants of infectious disease has been on inequity in chronic and endemic infections, such as Tuberculosis, diarrheal disease 7 , and HIV. Recently, however, attention has returned to social determinants of ARI, reflected in an increasing number of studies of disparities by race/ethnicity and SES in infection risk, severity and mortality for influenza [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , RSV 13 and all cause ARI 14 18 . Nevertheless, our understanding of the mechanistic links between SES and ARI related risks remains underdeveloped, as does our ability to address inequalities in ARI outcomes.
Closing this gap is urgent, as the question of how to address these disparate outcomes requires us to first understand how they are generated. Our goal is to identify the key axes of SES related disparity in ARI infection risk and outcomes. In many ways, the urgency of addressing these disparities results from positive momentum in biomedical research against influenza, RSV and other ARIs. A push .

522	"This study numerically investigates the effect of hygroscopicity on transport and deposition of particles in severe asthmatic lungs with distinct airway structures. The study human subjects were selected from two imaging based severe asthmatic clusters with one characterized by nonconstricted airways and the other by constricted airways in the lower left lobe (LLL). We compared the deposition fractions of sodium chloride (NaCl) particles with a range of aerodynamic diameters (1 8 µm) in cluster archetypes under conditions with and without hygroscopic growth. The temperature and water vapor distributions in the airways were simulated with an airway wall boundary condition that accounts for variable temperature and water vapor evaporation at the interface between the lumen and the airway surface liquid layer.
On average, the deposition fraction increased by about 6% due to hygroscopic particle growth in the cluster subjects with constricted airways, while it increased by only about 0.5% in those with non constricted airways. The effect of particle growth was most significant for particles with an initial diameter of 2 μm in the cluster subjects with constricted airways. The effect diminished with increasing particle size, especially for particles with an initial diameter larger than 4 μm.
This suggests the necessity to differentiate asthmatic subjects by cluster in engineering the aerosol size for tailored treatment. Specifically, the treatment of severe asthmatic subjects who have constricted airways with inhalation aerosols may need submicron sized hygroscopic particles to compensate for particle growth, if one targets for delivering to the peripheral region.
These results could potentially inform the choice of particle size for inhalational drug delivery in a cluster specific manner.

To determine the histological patterns in lung tissue of patients with severe COVID 19.
Design and participants. Lungs tissues of 38 cases who died for COVID 19 in two hospital of Northern Italy were systematically analysed. Hematoxylin eosin staining, immunohistochemistry for the inflammatory infiltrate and cellular components, electron microscopy were performed.
Results. The features of the exudative and proliferative phases of Diffuse Alveolar Disease (DAD) were found: capillary congestion, necrosis of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane, interstitial oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia and reactive atypia, platelet fibrin thrombi. The inflammatory infiltrate was composed by macrophages in alveolar lumens and lymphocytes mainly in the interstice. Electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cytoplasm of pneumocytes.
Conclusions and relevance. The predominant pattern of lung lesions in COVID 19 patients is DAD, as described for the other two coronavirus that infect humans, SARS CoV and MERS CoV. Hyaline membrane formation and pneumocyte atypical hyperplasia are frequently found. The main relevant finding is the presence of platelet fibrin thrombi in small arterial vessels; this important observation fits into the clinical context of coagulopathy which dominates in these patients and which is one of the main targets of therapy."	0
527	"The apparent early success in China's large scale intervention to control the COVID 19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when China relaxes the interventions. In this paper we look at the impact of a single short term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub population separately.
We do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not. We believe that is a policy question. If an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place. Our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain."	1

529	Understanding how interurban movements can modify the spatial distribution of the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental ingredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating the spread of a novel coronavirus . We first show that these travel flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations, creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter effect of keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring intra city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited.

530	"Human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 are respiratory pathogen of zoonotic origin that have gained 23 worldwide distribution. OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spill over. All 24 three viruses attach to 9 O acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin esterase HE 25 acting as a receptor destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity 26 towards clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to 27 humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced 28 evolution population d ynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor binding selected for second site 29 mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations 30 selected for cooperativity in virus swarms with low affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation 31 of high affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second site 32 substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and co evolve to 33 optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan based receptor 34 usage, entailing a concerted, fine tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among 35 CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Apparently, general principles fundamental 36 to virion sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human 37 and animal pathogens. The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae comprises a group of enveloped positive strand RNA viruses of 40 clinical and veterinary significance. Adding to the socio economic impact of coronaviruses (CoVs) 41 already extant in humans and livestock, the emergence of 'new' CoVs through cross species 42 transmission poses an ever looming threat to public health, animal health, and food production. 43 Seven coronaviruses are known to infect humans, but not all of them have become established. The 44 introduction of SARS CoV in 2002 from horseshoe bats with masked palm civets as incidental transient 45 hosts, was rapidly contained through quarantine measures 1 . MERS CoV, natural to dromedary camels, 46 causes a classical zoonotic infection with limited human to human spread 2 . December 2019, a 47 member of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARS CoV), called 48 SARS CoV 2 and 79.5% identical to the 2002 SARS CoV variant, emerged in Wuhan, China 3,4 to progress 49
to full scale pandemicity. Chances are, SARS CoV 2 will eventually become established in the human 50 population.
Four other respiratory coronaviruses of zoonotic origin already did succeed in becoming true human 52 viruses with world wide distribution 5 7 . Among them are HKU1 and OC43 (subgenus Embecovirus, 53 genus Betacoronavirus), related yet distinct viruses that arose from different zoonotic progenitors and 54 entered the human population independently. OC43 is far more related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV), 55 its presumptive ancestor, with early isolates sharing 97% genome identity 8,9 . Together with viruses of 56 swine, canines, equines and lagomorphs, OC43 and BCoV are considered host range variants of the 57 virus species Betacoronavirus 1 (collectively referred to as β1CoVs throughout) 7 . OC43 apparently 58 emerged 70 to 130 years ago from a single cross species transmission event that gave rise to a human 59 only virus [8][9][10] . Like OC43, other β1CoVs also exhibit host specificity 8,11 . While these observations attest 60 to the host promiscuity and zoonotic potential of embecoviruses and β1CoVs in particular, they are 61 also indicative for the existence of host barriers, the breaching of which selects for adaptive mutations 62 that result in host specialization and, ultimately, virus speciation.

The 71 HE lectin domain contributes to virion attachment, but at the same time enhances sialate O 72 acetylesterase activity towards clustered sialoglycotopes 11 . 73 Some embecoviruses, like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and related CoVs in rodents, attach to 4 or 9 74 O acetylated sialosides (4 or 9 O Ac Sias) via HE 21 25 and to a proteinaceous entry receptor via S 26,27 . 75 Others, animal β1CoVs included, bind to 9 O Ac Sias via HE 28 but, remarkably, also via S 29,30 or, in the 76 case of human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1, even exclusively via S 11,31,32 . 77 Structure function analyses of HE and S proteins have yielded a wealth of data on ligand binding, 78 substrate selection and protein glycan interactions. The receptor binding sites (RBSs) of CoV HE lectin 79 domains and those in related proteins of toro and influenza C/D viruses 22,33 35 differ in sequence and 80 structure yet conform to a common architectural design with a deep hydrophobic pocket ('P1') to 81 accommodate the crucial sialate O acetyl moiety, and an adjacent pocket or depression ('P2') to 82 accept the 5 N acyl group 17,21,22,33 . Characteristically, P1 and P2 are separated by an aromatic side 83 chain and binding of the ligand is stabilized further through electrostatic protein glycan interactions 84 typically involving distinctive Sia functions such as the Sia glycerol side chain, the 5 N Acyl and/or the 85 Sia carboxylate. The RBS for 9 O Ac Sia in the S proteins of BCoV and OC43, identified by comparative 86 structural analysis 32 and confirmed by the cryo EM holostructure of OC43 S 36 , conforms to this 87 blueprint. Moreover, this site is structurally and functionally conserved in HKU1 32 . : bioRxiv preprint 5 Much less is known about the functional relationship between S and HE, and the role of HE in particular 89 remains poorly understood. In MHV, HE expression is dispensable for replication and rapidly lost 90 during cell culture propagation 15 . Conversely, in β1CoVs, HE seems critical for infection. In OC43, loss 91 of HE associated acetyl esterase activity abrogates the production of infectious virus and virus 92 dissemination in cell culture 37 . Moreover, acetyl esterase inhibitors impede BCoV replication 19 , and 93 antibodies against HE neutralize the virus in vitro and in vivo 38 40 . Still, even among β1CoVs there are 94 differences in HE function apparently correlating with host specificity. Whereas HE lectin activity is 95 strictly maintained in BCoV 28 , OC43 lost this function through progressive accumulation of mutations 96 in the HE RBS, apparently as an adaptation to replication in the human respiratory tract 11 . 97 Nevertheless, isolates of either virus propagate in cultured cells. To better understand the 98 consequences of loss of HE lectin function as it occurred during OC43 and also HKU1 evolution, we 99 took a reverse genetics/forced evolution approach with BCoV as a model. The findings reveal that HE 100 and S are functionally interdependent and that the acquisition of HE by a proto embecovirus allowed 101 its β1CoV descendants to adopt strategies for reversible virion sialoglycan attachment, remarkably 102 similar to those of influenza A viruses. RESULTS 104 Disruption of HE lectin function selects for mutations in S. To study the role and importance of HE in 105 β1CoV propagation, we developed a reverse genetics system for BCoV strain Mebus (sFig. 1A) based 106 on targeted RNA recombination 41,42 . Recombinant 'wildtype' BCoVs (rBCoV) with parental type HE and 107 S, but with accessory ORF4a replaced by the Renilla luciferase gene (rBCoV Rluc), were readily 108 generated upon seeding acceptor virus infected, donor RNA transfected mouse LR7 cells onto 109 monolayers of feeder HRT18 cells. rBCoV Rluc arose and within seven days grew to final titers 110 routinely obtained for wildtype BCoV (~10 8 TCID50/ml). 111 Generating BCoV Rluc derivatives defective in HE lectin function proved more cumbersome. To 112 abolish the HE RBS, we substituted Phe 211 , which is key to ligand binding 17 (sFig. 1B), by Ala via two 113 nucleotide substitutions to block reversion. Mutant viruses were recovered eventually, but, in 3 out 114 of 4 successful trials, a multistep 160 hr rescue did not suffice and an additional 72 96 hr blind passage 115
was required (Fig. 1A) . 116 Sequence analysis of clonal virus populations, obtained by endpoint dilution, confirmed the presence 117 of the HE Phe 211 Ala substitution in all cases. Surprisingly, the purified viruses all suffered single site 118 mutations in S, clustering in domain S1 A (aa 15 302) in proximity of the RBS (Figs. 1A C; sFig. 2). Two 119 of the trials yielded multiple S variants and some variants  Thr 83 Ile and Leu 89 Pro emerged 120 independently in separate experiments (Fig. 1A) . The mutations map to three distinct S RBS elements 121 (Fig. 1C, sFig. 2C ; nomenclature according to 32 ). Ile 26 Ser and Asn 27 Ser locate in the S1 A β1 element 122 within the N terminal L1 β1 L2 segment (aa 15 33) that walls pocket P1; P1 is crucial for ligand binding 123 as it accommodates the all important sialate 9 O acetyl moiety 32,36 . Moreover, in the OC43 S cryo EM 124 holostructure, the Asn 27 side chain hydrogen bonds with the 9 O acetyl carbonyl 36 . Leu 89 Pro in S1 A 125 element 3101 is immediately adjacent to Trp 90 . The latter is arguably the most critical residue in the 126 RBS as its indole side chain separates the P1 and P2 pockets, and its replacement precludes receptor 127 binding and virus infectivity 32 . Finally, Gly 82 Glu and Thr 83 Ile substitutions occurred in S1 A element β5 128 that interacts with the sialate carboxylate through hydrogen bonding with Lys 81 and Thr 83 . : bioRxiv preprint 7 As measured by solid phase lectin binding assay (sp LBA) with S1 A  Fc fusion proteins and bovine 130 submaxillary mucin (BSM) as ligand, all mutations significantly reduced S binding to 9 O Ac Sia albeit 131 to widely different extents. S1 A  Fc binding affinities of the mutants were 500 fold (Asn 27 Ser) to more 132 than 10.000 fold (Ile 26 Ser; Gly 82 Glu) lower than that of parental BCoV S1 A  Fc (Fig. 1D) . 133 Loss of the HE lectin RBS would both abolish HE assisted virion attachment to 9 O Ac Sia receptor 134 determinants as well as reduce virion associated receptor destroying sialate O acetylesterase activity 135 towards clustered glycotopes 11 . The findings suggest that the HE Phe 211 Ala substitution creates a 136 fitness defect that can be alleviated not by increasing but by dramatically reducing the affinity of the 137 S RBS. Thus, the defect apparently is caused by loss of virion associated RDE activity rather than by 138 loss of overall virion avidity.
139
140 downregulation of HE esterase activity consequential to loss of lectin function, could affect virus 141 propagation at two stages of the infectious cycle, namely virus release, which would require depletion 142 of intracellular and cell surface receptor pools, and (pre)attachment. We recently reported that G 143 deficient vesicular stomatitis (VSV) virions pseudotyped with wildtype BCoV S require exogenous HE 144
for efficient infection 32 . S1 A mutations that reduce S affinity inhibit infection, but, as we now show, 145 only when HE is present. VSV virions pseudotyped with low affinity mutant S proteins were less reliant 146 on or even inhibited by exogenous HE with decreasing S RBS affinity (Fig. 1E) . The findings provide 147 direct proof that the S1 A mutations act at the level of virion attachment and support the notion that 148 the S1 A mutations, selected for in HE defective rBCoVs, restore reversibility of receptor binding by 149 lowering S affinity and thereby protect against inadvertent attachment to decoy receptors. 150 HE lectin deficient recombinant BCoVs are genetically stable when grown in the presence of 151 exogenous receptor destroying enzyme. To test whether loss of virion associated RDE activity in 152
rBCoV HE F 211 A/S wt /Rluc might be compensated for by adding exogenous soluble HE to the culture 153 medium, we seeded infected/transfected LR7 cells onto HRT18 cell monolayers, supplemented the 154 author/funder.

Sanger sequence analysis of RT PCR amplicons showed that all viruses cloned by endpoint dilution 162 of the 160 hr stock (n=4) coded for mutant HE Phe 211 Ala in combination with wildtype S1 A . To assess 163 the stability of clonal rBCoV HE F 211 A/S wt /Rluc, the virus population resulting from a subsequent 120 164 hr amplification in the presence of exogenous HE Fc was analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing 165 (NGS), which allows for the detection of low frequency mutants. Sequence variation in HE and S1 A was 166 distributed randomly and did not exceed background levels (<0.15%). More than 99.5% of the viruses 167 coded for HE Phe 211 Ala, while preserving parental type S1 A (Fig. 2B) .

169 among S affinity variants. With a clonal, virtually pure stock of rBCoV HE F 211 A/S wt available, we 170 performed controlled forced evolution experiments. The virus was serially passaged involving three 171 consecutive 120 hr multistep propagation rounds in HRT18 cells but now in the absence of exogenous 172 HE Fc, with the initial infection at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.005 (Fig. 2C) . In trial 1, viral titers 173 in passage 1 (p1) increased only slowly to 3 x 10 4 and 2 x 10 4 TCID50/ml (measured with or without 174 exogenous HE Fc, respectively). The withdrawal of exogenous RDE during viral passage immediately 175 selected for mutations in S1 A . Virus cloning by endpoint dilution of the 120 hr p1 sample yielded S RBS 176 mutants Asn 27 Ser, Thr 83 Ile and Ile 26 Ser (Fig. 2C )  all three of which had been seen before (Fig. 1A) . 177 NGS analysis revealed the true complexity of the p1 population (Fig. 2C) and identified two additional 178 S1 A variants with substitutions  His 173 Tyr and Arg 197 Cys more distal from the RBS (sFigs. 2D, 3A, B) . 179 His 173 Tyr also reduced the relative binding affinity of S1 A  Fc albeit less dramatically than the other 180 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. : bioRxiv preprint 9 mutations, namely by 30 fold ( Table 1) . The Arg 197 Cys mutation seemingly falls in a separate category 181 as it reduced S1 A  Fc expression levels by more than 90% suggestive of defective folding (sFig. 3C). 182 Apparently, aberrant disulfide bonding causes most of the fusion protein to be retained in the ER with 183 only a minor, presumably properly folded fraction slipping through to become secreted.
All in all, the p1 population was comprised for virtually 100% of HE Phe 211 Ala mutants, 40% of which 185 in combination with parental BCoV S, the remaining 60% with second site mutations in S1 A ( Fig. 2C; 186 Table 1 ). Of the latter, the ultra low affinity variant S1 A  Ile 26 Ser was the most abundant at 46% and 187 the Asn 27 Ser variant the least at less than 1%. However, upon a subsequent round of 120 hr multistep 188 propagation, the tables were turned with S1 A  Asn 27 Ser now comprising almost 40% of the p2 189 population and the Ile 26 Ser variant reduced to 0.7%. In addition, four other S1 A variants emerged. One 190 of these had a mutation in S1 A RBS loop L1, Val 29 Gly, and a relative binding affinity close to that of the 191 Asn 27 Ser mutant ( Fig. 2C; Table 1 ). We also identified at position 75 a second S1 A Cys substitution 192 mutant, which like Arg 197 Cys, presumably disrupts the RBS through aberrant disulfide bonding (sFig. 193 3). Remarkably, two other S1 A variants arose with mutations  Arg 88 Thr and Pro 174 Leu that affected 194 the relative binding affinity only modestly to 0.25 and 0.5 of that of wildtype S1 A  Fc, respectively 195 ( Table 1) . Even more remarkably, upon further passage these mutants increased to dominate the p3 196 population, effectively outcompeting variants with low affinity spikes as well as those with parental 197 spikes (Fig. 2C, D) . However, when the p1, p2 and p3 stocks were cloned by endpoint dilution in the 198 absence of exogenous HE Fc, only virus variants with low affinity mutations in S1 A were isolated (Fig. "	0
531	"As a city famous for tourism, the public healthcare system of Macau SAR has been under great pressure during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 . In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID 19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020. Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT PCR assay. In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases. The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days. Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation. No fatal cases were noted. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%). In the ""Severe"" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C Reactive protein levels compared to the ""Mild to Moderate"" group (p<0.001). There were positive SARS CoV 2 RNA signals in all patients' NPS and stool specimens but negative in all urine specimens. Based on our data on SARS CoV 2 RNA shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, the assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimen is recommended to enhance diagnostic sensitivity, and also to aid discharge decision before the role of viral RNA shedding in stool is clarified."	0

534	As of April 18, 2020, 2.16 million patients in the world had been tested positive with Coronavirus (COVID 19) and 146,088 had died, which accounts for a case fatality rate of 6.76%. In Mexico, according to official statistics (April 18), 7,497 cases have been confirmed with 650 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 8.67%. These estimates, however, may not reflect the final fatality risk among COVID 19 confirmed patients, because they are based on crosssectional counts of diagnosed and deceased patients, and therefore are not adjusted by time of exposure and right censorship. In this paper we estimate fatality risks based on survival analysis methods, calculated from individual level data on symptomatic patients confirmed with COVID 19 recently released by the Mexican Ministry of Health. The estimated fatality risk after 35 days of onset of symptoms is 12.38% (95% CI: 11.37 13.47). Fatality risks sharply rise with age, and significantly increase for males (59%) and individuals with comorbidities (38% 168%, depending on the disease). Two reasons may explain the high COVID 19 related fatality risk observed in Mexico, despite its younger age structure: the high selectivity and diseases.	0
535	"Background. Administration of convalescent plasma may be of clinical benefit for treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections. However, no clear evidence exists to support or oppose convalescent plasma use in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review and meta analysis to assess the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza.
Methods. Healthcare databases were searched in February 2020. All records were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken. The primary outcome was case fatality rates by influenza.
Results. We identified 5 RCTs of severe influenza. The pooled analyses showed no evidence for a reduction in mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 2.23; p = 0.87; I 2 = 35%). We also found non significant reductions in days in ICU and hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation. There seemed to have a biological benefit of increasing HAI titer levels and decreasing influenza B virus loads and cytokines after convalescent plasma treatment. No serious adverse events was reported between two groups. Studies were commonly of low risk of bias with high quality.
Conclusions. Convalescent plasma appears safe but may not reduce mortality in severe influenza. This therapy should be studied within the context of a well designed clinical trial for treatment of SARS Cov 2 infection. CR, Convalescent Plasma Study G.

537	With the spiraling pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 , it has becoming inherently important to disseminate accurate and timely information about the disease. Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic sensing paradigm to collect real time observations from online users. In this vision paper we propose CovidSens, the concept of social sensing based risk alerting systems to notify the general public about the COVID 19 spread. The CovidSens concept is motivated by two recent observations: 1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID 19 via online social media, and 2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID 19 on social media. We anticipate an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the social media users to build a real time analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID 19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions of: how to track the spread of the COVID 19? How to distill reliable information about the disease with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively and alert them to remain prepared? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in implementing reliable social sensing based risk alerting systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines (e.g. estimation theory, machine learning, constrained optimization) can be effective in addressing the challenges. Finally, we outline a few research directions for future work in CovidSens.	0
538	"Compartment models of infectious diseases, such as SEIR, are being used extensively to model the COVID 19 epidemic. Transitions between compartments are modelled either as instantaneous rates in differential equations, or as transition probabilities in discrete time difference or matrix equations. These models give accurate estimates of the position of equilibrium points, when the rate at which individuals enter each stage is equal to the rate at which they exit from it. However, they do not accurately capture the distribution of times that an individual spends in each compartment, so do not accurately capture the transient dynamics of epidemics. Here we show how matrix models can provide a straightforward route to accurately model stage durations, and thus correctly reproduce epidemic dynamics. We apply this approach to modelling the dynamics of a COVID 19 epidemic. We show that a SEIR model underestimates peak infection rates (by a factor of three using published parameter estimates based on the progress of the epidemic in Wuhan) and substantially overestimates epidemic persistence after the peak has passed.

539	The novel coronavirus disease, COVID 19 caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2), has resulted in thousands of critically ill patients and poses a serious threat globally. To investigate if SARS CoV 2 can affect early human embryos, we analysed scRNAseq datasets of human embryos for the SARS CoV 2 receptors ACE2 and BSG (CD147), the serine protease TMPRSS2 for viral spike protein priming, and the endosomal protease CTSL for spike protein activation via the endosomal route. The results reveal that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co expressed in a proportion of epiblast cells, and both BSG and CTSL are expressed in all the stages of embryonic development. The cells of the blastocysts express genes encoding for other coronavirus receptors such as DPP4 and ANPEP as well. Interestingly, the cells of the epiblast also express genes involved in viral endocytosis and replication. We further identified 194 genes that are differentially expressed in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 positive cells as compared to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 negative cells of the epiblast. Our results show that developing human embryos express the receptors for SARS CoV 2 and other coronaviruses; embryos also harbour the necessary machinery for viral internalization and replication. We suggest that couples be advised to avoid conceiving during the pandemic and that IVF procedures be kept to a minimum to prevent any possible hazard to the developing embryos.	0

In this study, we propose a time series model to analyze the trend pattern of the incidence of COVID 19 outbreak. We also incorporate information on total or partial lockdown, wherever available, into the model. The model is concise in structure, and countries.	0

The traditional drug discovery focuses on identifying direct inhibitors of target proteins. This approach typically relies on a specific measurable biochemical readout and amenable binding sites of which the occupancy directly influences the target protein's function. These requirements preclude many disease causing proteins from being ""druggable"" targets, and these proteins are categorized as ""undruggable"". The proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology provides powerful tools to degrade these ""undruggable"" targets and has become a promising approach for drug discovery. However, the PROTAC technology may have limitations and emerging new degrader technologies may greatly broaden the spectrum of targets that could be selectively degraded by harnessing another major degradation pathway in cells. Here we review a few key emerging technologies that exploit the lysosomal degradation pathway and discuss their potential applications as well as limitations.

545	"Following successful implementation of strong containment measures by the community, Australia is now close to the point of eliminating detectable community transmission of COVID 19. We aimed to develop an efficient, rapid and scalable surveillance strategy for detecting all remaining COVID 19 community transmission through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We also identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not need to be reinstated.
We compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of: hospital cases; primary care fever and cough patients; or asymptomatic community members, using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities and prevalence of COVID 19 and non COVID 19 fever and cough, and the reproduction number. System requirements for increasing testing to allow exhaustive identification of all transmission chains, and then enable complete follow up of all cases and contacts within each chain, were assessed per million population.
Assuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and all symptomatic COVID 19 cases present to primary care, with high transmission (R=2.2) there are a median of 13 unrecognised community cases (5 infectious) when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 3 unrecognised cases (1 infectious) through primary care surveillance. 3 unrecognised community upstream community cases themselves are estimated to generate a further 22 33 contacts requiring follow up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 5 if only 50% of symptomatic cases present to primary care. Screening for asymptomatic disease in the community cannot exhaustively identify all transmission under any of the scenarios assessed. The additional capacity required to screen all fever and cough primary care patients would be approximately 2,000 tests/million population per week using 1/16 pooling of samples.
Screening all syndromic fever and cough primary care presentations, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of community transmission of COVID 19. If testing capacity is limited, interventions such as pooling allow increased case detection, even given reduced test sensitivity. Wider identification and testing of all upstream contacts, (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains) is critical, and to be done exhaustively requires more resources than downstream contact tracing. The most important factor in determining the performance of such a surveillance system is community participation in screening and follow up, and as such, appropriate community engagement, messaging and support to encourage presentation and compliance is essential. We provide operational guidance on implementing such a system."	0

A total of 691 cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) infection had been confirmed as of February 23. The government initially assumed that the infection was not spreading aboard and therefore indicated that any persons who either tested negative for the virus or were asymptomatic should immediately disembark. However, on February 5, the government set a 14 day health observation period because of the severity of the infection. Passengers confirmed to be free from infection began disembarking on Day 15 (February 19) of the quarantine. The effectiveness and validity of infection control, justification for the timing of inspections, and even the nature of COVID 19 itself now are all in question. The ethical considerations related to cruise ship infection control include the reasonable justification for isolation, the psychological fragility and quality of life of the isolated passengers and crew members, the procedural justice inherent in a forced quarantine, and the optimization of control measures. The international coordination framework and the global ramifications of such outbreaks should be reevaluated by the international community.

The manifestations of computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID 19 had their own characteristics, which are different from other types of viral pneumonia, such as Influenza A viral pneumonia. Therefore, clinical doctors call for another early diagnostic criteria for this new type of pneumonia as soon as possible. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish an early screening model to distinguish COVID 19 pneumonia from Influenza A viral pneumonia and healthy cases with pulmonary CT images using deep learning techniques. DESIGN: The candidate infection regions were first segmented out using a 3 dimensional deep learning model from pulmonary CT image set. These separated images were then categorized into COVID 19, Influenza A viral pneumonia and irrelevant to infection groups, together with the corresponding confidence scores using a location attention classification model. Finally the infection type and total confidence score of this CT case were calculated with Noisy or Bayesian function. SETTING: CT samples contributed from three COVID 19 designated hospitals from Zhejiang Province, China. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 618 CT samples were collected: 219 from 110 patients with COVID 19, 224 CT samples from 224 patients with Influenza A viral 5 / 29 pneumonia, and 175 CT samples from healthy people.
The experiments result of benchmark dataset showed that the overall accuracy was 86.7 % from the perspective of CT cases as a whole.
The deep learning models established in this study were effective for the early screening of COVID 19 patients and demonstrated to be a promising supplementary diagnostic method for frontline clinical doctors."	0

556	This study was designed to test the efficacy of an air treatment using ozone and relative humidity (RH) for the inactivation of airborne viruses. Four phages (φX174, PR772, MS2 and φ6) and one eukaryotic virus (murine norovirus MNV 1) were exposed to low ozone concentrations (1.23 ppm for phages and 0.23 ppm for MNV 1) and various levels of RH for 10 to 70 minutes. The inactivation of these viruses was then assessed to determine which of the tested conditions provided the greatest reduction in virus infectivity. An inactivation of at least two orders of magnitude for φX174, MS2 and MNV 1 was achieved with an ozone exposure of 40 minutes at 85% RH. For PR772 and φ6, exposure to the reference condition at 20% RH for 10 minutes yielded the same results. These findings suggest that ozone used at a low concentration is a powerful disinfectant for airborne viruses when combined with a high RH. Air treatment could therefore be implemented inside hospital rooms ventilated naturally.	1
557	We analyze the temporal evolution of accumulated hospitalization cases due to COVID 19 in Belgium. The increase of hospitalization cases is consistent with an initial exponential phase, and a subsequent power law growth. For the latter, we estimate a power law exponent of ≈ 2.2, which is consistent with growth kinetics of COVID 19 in China and indicative of the underlying small world network structure of the epidemic. Finally, we fit an SIR X model to the experimental data and estimate the effect of containment policies in comparison to their effect in China. This model suggests that the base reproduction rate has been significantly reduced, but that the number of susceptible individuals that	1

Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS CoV 2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS CoV 2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS CoV 2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.	0
559	Oxidative stress has been shown to play an important role in many disease pathologies, such as cachexia, sepsis, hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI), chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [31,35]. The molecular mechanism underlying the protection associated with oxidative phenotype appears to be NO mediated enhancement of the antioxidant defense as systemic administration of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) to mimic sepsis led to induced inducible NO synthase (iNOS), CuZnSOD, MnSOD, EcSOD and CAT mRNAs in atrophy resistant oxidative muscle, but not in atrophy prone glycolytic muscle in mice [116]. Genetically engineered mice with skeletal muscle specific overexpression of EcSOD to recapitulate the effects of exercise training showed significantly reduced diabetic cardiomyopathy with reduced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, oxidative damage as well as reduce impairment of cell signaling in a model of late stage type 1 diabetes induced streptozotocin (STZ) injection [11]. In line with the notion that EcSOD plays a critical role in the first line of defense against superoxide generation in the lung tissue, acute loss of EcSOD in adult mice (inducible EcSOD−/− mice) causes a dramatic increase of mortality with ALI/ARDS even in ambient oxygen although global EcSOD−/− mice are viable and tolerate exposure to ambient oxygen levels without difficulties.	0

The detection of SARS CoV 2 is important for the prevention of the outbreak and management of patients. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) assay detected the virus in clinical laboratory.
This study utilized primers and single quencher probes in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan. Moreover, we designed the double quencher probes (YCH assay) according to the oligonucleotide sequence established by NIID. Using these assays, we conducted a one step real time RT PCR with serial DNA positive control to assess the detection sensitivity.
The threshold cycle (Ct) value of RT PCR was relatively low in CDC and YCH assays compared to NIID assay. Serial dilution assay showed that both CDC and YCH assays could detect a low copy number of DNA positive control. The background fluorescent signal at the baseline was lower in YCH than that of NIID.
Double quencher probes decreased background fluorescent signal and improved detection sensitivity of SARS CoV 2."	0

Pollen likely seasonal factor in inhibiting flu like epidemics. A Dutch study into the inverse relation between pollen counts, hay fever and flu like incidence 2016 2019
Martijn J. Hoogeveen
There is uncertainty if current models for the Covid 19 pandemic should already take into account seasonality. That is because current environmental factors do not provide a powerful explanation of such seasonality, especially given climate differences between countries with moderate climates. It is hypothesized that one major factor is overlooked: pollen count. Pollen are documented to invoke strong immune responses and might create an environmental factor that makes it more difficult for flu like viruses to survive outside a host. This Dutch study confirms that there is a (highly) significant inverse correlation between pollen count and weekly changes in medical flu consults, and that there is a highly significant inverse correlation between hay fever incidence, as measured by prescribed medication revenues, and weekly flu consults. This supports the idea that pollen are a direct or indirect factor in the seasonality of flu like epidemics. If seasonality will be observed during the covid 19 spread as well, it is not unlikely that pollen play a role."	0
570	"Background. Brazil detected community transmission of COVID 19 on March 13, 2020. In this study we identify which areas in the country are most vulnerable for COVID 19, both in terms of the risk of arrival of COVID 19 cases and the risk of sustained transmission. The micro regions with higher social vulnerability are also identified.
Methods. Probabilistic models were used to calculate the probability of COVID 19 spread from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, according to previous data available on human mobility in Brazil. We also perform a multivariate cluster analysis of socio economic indices to identify areas with similar social vulnerability.
Results. The results consist of a series of maps of effective distance, outbreak probability, hospital capacity and social vulnerability. They show areas in the North and Northeast vulnerable."	0
571	We discovered that the time evolution of the inverse fractional daily growth of new infections, N/∆ N , in the current outbreak of COVID 19 is accurately described by a universal function, namely the two parameter Gumbel cumulative function, in all countries that we have investigated. While the two Gumbel parameters, as determined bit fits to the data, vary from country to country (and even within different regions of the same country), reflecting the diversity and efficacy of the adopted containment measures, the functional form of the evolution of ∆ N/N appears to be universal. The result of the fit in a given region or country appears to be stable against variations of the selected time interval. This makes it possible to robustly estimate the two parameters from the data data even over relatively small time periods. In turn, this allows one to predict with large advance and well controlled confidence levels, the time of the peak in the daily new infections, its magnitude and duration (hence the total infections), as well as the time when the daily new infections decrease to a pre set value (e.g. less than about 2 new infections per day per million people), which can be very useful for planning the reopening of economic and social activities. We use this formalism to predict and compare these key features of the evolution of the COVID 19 disease in a number of countries and provide a quantitative assessment of the degree of success in in their efforts to countain the outbreak.	0
572	"The 2013 2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date. An analysis of virus specific CD8  T cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8  response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire.
We show that a 9 amino acid peptide NP44 52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 : bioRxiv preprint mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44 52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8  T cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within SARS CoV 2 contain multiple class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage. A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for that virus."	0
574	"The purpose of the present paper is to present simple estimation and prediction methods for basic quantities in an emerging epidemic like the ongoing covid 10 pandemic. The simple methods have the advantage that relations between basic quantities become more transparent, thus shedding light to which quantities have biggest impact on predictions, with the additional conclusion that uncertainties in these quantities carry over to high uncertainty also in predictions.
A simple non parametric prediction method for future cumulative case fatalities, as well as future cumulative incidence of infections (assuming a given infection fatality risk f ), is presented. The method uses cumulative reported case fatalities up to present time as input data. It is also described how the introduction of preventive measures of a given magnitude ρ will affect the two incidence predictions, using basic theory of that uncertainty in s d affects time locations but not predicited numbers."	0

reported to have SARS after exposure to an index case. One infected staff member had no exposure to any admitted patient with SARS and was classified as a communityacquired infection. All index patients and infected staff in the study, except for one, showed a four fold rise in the number of antibodies to corona like virus.
356 completed questionnaires were returned, covering 85% of the staff on roster. Non responders were mostly those on leave or night shift, which is rotated among the staff. We excluded 102 staff who had no contact with index patients. Most of the infected staff were from the medical wards (table 1) , and omitted at least one of the four measures queried. Two who were using a mask reported only paper masks.
Staff who used masks, gowns, and handwashing were less likely to develop SARS than those who did not use them, but the association for gloves was not significant (table 2) . None of the 69 staff reporting use of all four measures became infected. By contrast, all 13 infected staff had omitted at least one of the measures (p=0·0224). However logistic regression of the four measures with forward stepwise selection showed that only use of masks was significant in the final model (table 2) .
The staff who wore surgical masks and N95 masks were significantly associated with non infection (table 2), but this was not seen for paper masks.
That use of masks and hand washing was associated with non infection, and that no staff became infected when they used all four measures, suggest that precautions against droplets and contact are adequate for prevention of nosocomial SARS, where no aerosolisations are expected. The surgical and N95 masks were both effective in significantly reducing the risk of infection, which together with the finding that 30% of non infected staff did not use masks (table 2) supports that transmission is not airborne. The finding that paper masks did not significantly reduce the risk is not unexpected. Such masks, being easily wet with saliva, are never recommended as a precaution against droplets. 3 In any survey, recall bias is a concern. However, it probably had little effect since the associations shown are clear and the information requested was about simple concrete behaviour and events that took place recently. Masks seem to be essential for protection, since only this measure was significant in stepwise logistic regression. Thus, in hospital, the other three measures add no significant protection to the mask. This finding fits well with droplets transmission because droplets are generated at the face level making the mask crucial for protection.

The proposed work aims to extract and evaluate the Coronavirus disease caused pneumonia infection in lung using CT scans. We propose an image assisted system to extract COVID 19 infected sections from lung CT scans (coronal view). It includes following steps: (i) Threshold filter to extract the lung region by eliminating possible artifacts; (ii) Image enhancement using Harmony Search Optimization and Otsu thresholding; (iii) Image segmentation to extract infected region(s); and (iv) Region of interest (ROI) extraction (features) from binary image to compute level of severity. The features that are extracted from ROI are then employed to identify the pixel ratio between the lung and infection sections to identify infection level of severity. The primary objective of the tool is to assist the pulmonologist not only to detect but also to help plan treatment process. As a consequence, for mass screening processing, it will help prevent diagnostic burden. respiratory system and the untreated lung disease will lead to death. The major causes of lung defects are due to diseases, such as tuberculosis, lung cancer, and pneumonia [1, 2] . Further, the infection in lungs due to microorganisms, such as bacteria, virus and fungi may cause mild to harsh illness; which may require instantaneous medical support to cure the disease.
When a patient is admitted to the hospital due to respiratory infection, the pulmonologist will recommend a series of diagnostic procedures ranging from the non laboratory to laboratory tests to identify the cause, location, and severity of the infection. The laboratory tests include common procedures, like complete blood count, blood gas analysis and pleural fluid analysis [3, 4] . The nonlaboratory tests are mainly the image assisted techniques used to record or inspect the lung regions using chest radiography (X ray), Computed Tomography (CT) scan and bronchoscope. Due to its non invasive nature, the chest X ray and CT are commonly used to record the digital images of the lungs, which can be further examined by an experienced doctor or a computer supported system to identify the severity of the infection. Compared to the chest X ray, the CT Scan Images (CTSI) is widely preferred due to its merit and the three dimensional view of the lung; which further can be used to provide 2D images of axial, coronal and Sagittal View for the better diagnosis. The recent studies also confirmed the merit of the CT in detecting the infection in the respiratory tract and pneumonia [5] .
The objective of the proposed work is to develop an image processing procedure to extract the infected section of COVID 19from lung CTSI. The recent studies on COVID 19 infection confirmed that, the assessment of disease severity rate is essential to plan for the appropriate treatment to cure the patients. In real time scenarios, infected regions from the bio imaging methods, such as CT and chest radiographs are assessed by an experienced doctor and based on the recommendation; possible treatment procedures are suggested and implemented to reduce the infection level. The personal detection with an experienced doctor will be a tedious task when the number of patients is large and hence, it is necessary to develop an automated/semi automated image processing procedure to assist the doctor to examine the lung images of the patients. This procedure will considerably reduce the diagnostic burden of the doctor by segregating the lung CTSI based on the severity level. Further, this procedure also will assist the doctor to track the changes in infection rate (reduction/progress in infection) when the treatment is implemented.
The current literature on COVID 19 confirms that the disease infection rate in a patient is normally performed with lung CT/X ray images and correct detection of the infection level is very essential to plan for an appropriate treatment process. The infection visibility in chest X ray is very poor and it needs the expertise to identify and understand the information; hence in most of the recent works; CTSI is preferred compared to the chest X ray. Further, the work of Li et al. [6] also suggested that, visual quantitative analysis using the CTSI provided good reliability and better diagnostic capability. Hence, the proposed work considered the coronal view of the two dimensional CTSI for the experimental investigation. The proposed study is investigated in the MATLAB ® environment and the essential CTSI of COVID 19 is collected from the Radiopedia database [7].
This work implements a series of procedures, such as threshold filtering, multi thresholding, segmentation and area feature extraction to detect the COVID 19 pneumonia infection from the considered CTSI. After extracting the infected region with better accuracy, the infection stage is then computed using the ratio of pixels in the infection/lung section. This Severity Level Measure (SLM) is then considered to short the existing patient's CTSI and the image that has a higher value of SLM will be sent to the pulmonologist for the approval. The pulmonologist will also perform a visual check on the CTSI, and as per the findings, the appropriate treatment will be initiated.
The remaining part of this research is presented as follows; section 2 discusses the existing works on the COVID 19 database, section 3 outlines the methodology implemented, sections 4 and 5 present the experimental outcome and the conclusion, respectively."	0

Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical characteristics of 2019 nCoV infection were collected for Meta analysis.
Results: Ten studies were included in Meta analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with 2019 nCoV infection. Meta analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 89.1%, the incidence of cough was 72.2%, and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 42.5%. The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 14.8%, the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 96.6%, the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 18.1%, and the case fatality rate of patients with 2019 nCoV infection was 4.3%. Conclusion: Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with 2019 nCoV infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms only occur in a small number of patients. The case fatality rate of patients with 2019 nCoV infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)."	0

583	Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, singlestranded, zoonotic RNA viruses. Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2 229E,  HKU1,  NL63 and  OC43. However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans. The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) in 2012. The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID 19) in China and multiple other countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic. In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and even death. SARS CoV, MERS CoV and SARS CoV 2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case fatality rates. Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS CoV 2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms. However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults. Most children with SARS CoV present with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs. Many children affected by MERS CoV are asymptomatic. The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them. In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure. In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.	0

585	We developed a computational tool to assess the risks of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside of China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number R loc ). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia, and Europe. We investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is growing.	0

Interferon (IFN) administration is the main therapy for HCV infected individuals, but still a fraction of them are not completely responsive to the treatment. Several HCV proteins such as core, E2, and NS5A proteins have been demonstrated to attenuate IFN responses through different mechanisms. In the present study, we examined whether HCV NS4B, a membrane bound protein whose functions are mostly unknown, exerted any effects on IFN induced antiviral responses. From the reporter assay, we showed that NS4B significantly suppressed IFN induced activation of IFNstimulated responsive element (ISRE) promoter activity. We further examined the ability of HCV NS4B to confer IFN resistance on VSV, an originally IFN sensitive virus, by a trans rescue assay. The viral titer was low when cells were treated with IFN a, which, however, was significantly increased by HCV NS4B. We also examined the effects of HCV NS4B on the transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) by qRT PCR and found that the IFN induced expression of ISG15, ISG54, ISG56, and OAS2 p69 was significantly downregulated by NS4B. The results were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay . The levels and the activation status of the interferon stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), known to regulate the IFN pathway, were also noticeably reduced by NS4B. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that, in addition to the above mentioned HCV proteins, HCV NS4B may also play a role in IFN antagonism."	0

and HCoV HKU1, the effective reproduction number typically reached its peak between October
and November and its trough between February and May. Over the five seasons included in our
data (2014 2019), the median peak effective reproduction number was 1.85 (range: 1.61 2.21)
for HCoV HKU1 and 1.56 (range: 1.54 1.80) for HCoV OC43 after removing outliers (five for
HCoV HKU1, zero for HCoV OC43). The intensity of the initial pandemic wave will depend fundamentally on the basic
reproduction number at the time of epidemic establishment: if establishment occurs in the
autumn when the reproduction number is rising, which could occur in countries that maintain
epidemic control by contact tracing and quarantine through the summer, or if SARS CoV 2 is
not subject to the same summertime decline in transmissibility as HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1,
then a high peak prevalence of infection is likely. The construction of spatially explicit models will become more feasible as more data on
SARS CoV 2 incidence becomes available; these will help determine whether there are
differences in seasonal forcing between geographic locations, as for influenza (12), and will also introductions."	0
595	"Introduction: The world is currently undergoing an extremely stressful scenario due to the pandemic. This unexpected and dramatic situation could increase the incidence of mental health problems, among them, psychotic disorders. The aim of this paper was to describe a case series of brief reactive psychosis due to the psychological distress from the current coronavirus pandemic.
Materials and methods: We report on a case series including all the patients with reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID 19 crisis who were admitted to the Virgen del Rocío and Virgen Macarena University Hospitals (Seville, Spain) during the first two weeks of compulsory nationwide quarantine.
Results: In that short period, four patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5) criteria for a brief reactive psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID 19 pandemic and half of the patients presented severe suicidal behavior at admission.
Conclusions: We may now be witnessing an increasing number of brief reactive psychotic disorders as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. This type of psychosis has a high risk of suicidal behavior and, although short lived, has a high rate of psychotic recurrence and low diagnostic stability over time. Therefore, we advocate close monitoring in both the acute phase and long term follow up of these patients."	0
596	Activating mutations in LRRK2 kinase cause Parkinson's disease. Pathogenic LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases and blocks ciliogenesis. Thus, defining novel phospho Rab interacting partners is critical to our understanding of the molecular basis of LRRK2 pathogenesis. RILPL2 binds with strong preference to LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab8A and Rab10. RILPL2 is a binding partner of the motor protein and Rab effector, Myosin Va. We show here that the globular tail domain of Myosin Va also contains a high affinity binding site for LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab10, and certain tissue specific Myosin Va isoforms strongly prefer to bind phosphorylated Rab10. In the presence of pathogenic LRRK2, RILPL2 relocalizes to the peri centriolar region in a phosphoRab10 and Myosin Vadependent manner. In the absence of phosphoRab10, expression of RILPL2 or depletion of Myosin Va increase centriolar RILPL2 levels, and either condition is sufficient to block ciliogenesis in RPE cells. These experiments show that LRRK2 generated phosphoRab10 dramatically redistributes Myosin Va RILPL2 complexes to the mother centriole, which may sequester Myosin Va and RILPL2 in a manner that blocks their normal roles in ciliogenesis.	0

602	To model the spread of COVID 19 coronavirus in Russian regions and in Moscow, a discrete logistic equation describing the increase in the number of cases is used. To check the adequacy of the mathematical model, the simulation results were compared with the spread of coronavirus in China, in a number of European and Asian countries, and the United States. The parameters of the logistics equation for Russia, Moscow and other large regions were determined in the interval [01.03  08.04]. A comparative analysis of growth rates of COVID 19 infected population for different countries and regions is presented. Various scenarios of the spread of COVID 19 coronavirus in Moscow and in the regions of Russia are considered. For each scenario, curves for the daily new cases and graphs for the increase in the total number of cases were obtained, and the dynamics of infection spread by day was studied. Peak times, epidemic periods, the number of infected people at the peak and their growth were determined.	0

607	In the COVID 19 pandemic caused by SARS CoV 2, hospitals are stretched beyond capacity. There are widespread reports of dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), which are paramount to protect frontline medical/nursing staff and to minimize further spread of the virus. We carried out a rapid review to summarize the existing evidence on SARS CoV 2 survivorship and methods to disinfect PPE gear, particularly N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFR). In the absence of data on SARS CoV 2, we focused on the sister virus SARS CoV 1. We propose a two step disinfection process, which is conservative in the absence of robust evidence on SARS CoV 2. This disinfection protocol is based on an initial storage of PPE for ≥4 days, followed by ultraviolet light (UVC), dry heat treatment, or chemical disinfection. Importantly, each of the two steps is based on independent disinfection mechanisms, so that our proposed protocol is a multiplicative system, maximising the efficacy of our disinfection process. This method could be rapidly implemented in other healthcare settings, while testing of each method is undertaken, increasing the frontline supply of PPE, and avoiding faced.	0

610	Huang et al. 1 used their EpiRank algorithm, which emphasizes forward and backward commuter flow between homes and workplaces, to analyze the distribution patterns of two infectious diseases in Taiwan: the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus and the widespread emergence of the 2000 2008 type 71 enterovirus (EV). As this article was being prepared, the spreading mechanism of the novel coronavirus disease now designated as COVID 19 had yet to be identified, but according to the American Centers for Disease Control, its spreading mechanism and patterns are likely more similar to influenza than to other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV 1) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS CoV). To consider potential COVID 19 spatial patterns, we applied EpiRank to the 2003 SARS outbreak in north Taiwan for comparison with H1N1 and EV. SARS was found to be less contagious than H1N1 or EV, but with a significantly higher fatality rate. The characteristics of these diseases determined their specific spatial spreading patterns, as reflected in the different effects of forward and backward commuting movement. Our motivation is to highlight these differences and to illustrate EpiRank spatial patterns for the 2003 SARS outbreak for comparison with EpiRank determined distributions for the H1N1 and EV outbreaks. Our results indicate that the daytime parameter (i.e., forward movement effect) range was slightly higher (0.5 0.55) for the SARS outbreak than for either the influenza (0.4 0.5) or EV (0.3 0.5) outbreaks, suggesting that the forward and backward movements of individuals between residential and core urban areas with concentrated populations were equally important regarding the spread of SARS. While COVID 19 might resemble either SARS or H1N1 in terms of spatial spreading, its daytime parameter is likely somewhere in between, with backward movement being dominant (similar to H1N1) or with forward and backward movement being equally important (similar to SARS). Building on Huang et al.'s paper, we present an estimated risk distribution pattern for the Taipei Metropolitan Area for a daytime parameter of 0.55.	0
611	The outbreak the SARS CoV 2 (CoV 2) virus has resulted in over 2.5 million cases of COVID19, greatly stressing global healthcare infrastructure. Lacking medical prophylactic measures to combat disease spread, many nations have adopted social distancing policies in order to mitigate transmission of CoV 2. While mathematical models have suggested the efficacy of social distancing to curb the spread of CoV 2, there is a lack of systematic studies to quantify the realworld efficacy of these approaches. Here, we quantify the spread rate of COVID19 before and after national social distancing measures were implemented in 26 nations and compare this to the changes in COVID19 spread rate over equivalent time periods in 27 nations that did not enact social distancing policies. We find that social distancing policies significantly reduced the COVID19 spread rate. Using mixed linear regression models we estimate that social distancing policies reduced the spread of COVID19 by 66%. These data suggest that social distancing policies may be a powerful tool to prevent spread of COVID19 in real world scenarios.	0

613	The CoVid 19 is spreading pandemically all over the world. A rapid defeat of the pandemic requires carrying out on the population a mass screening, able to separate positive from negative cases. Such a cleaning will free a flow of productive population. The current rate and cost of testing, performed with the common PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method and with the available resources, is forcing a selection of the subjects to be tested. Indeed, each one must be examined individually at the cost of precious time. Moreover, the exclusion of potentially positive individuals from screening induces health risks, a broad slowdown in the effort to curb the viral spread, and the consequent mortality rates. We present a new procedure, the Purified by Unified Resampling of Infected Multitudes, in short Purim, able to untangle any massive candidate sample with inexpensive screening, through the crosscorrelated analysis of the joint speciments. This procedure can reveal and detect most negative patients and in most cases discover the identity of the few positives already in the first or few secondary tests. We investigate the the two dimensional correlation case in function of the infection probability. The multi dimensional topology, the scaled Purim procedure are also considered. Extensive Purim tests may measure and weight the degree of epidemic: their outcome may identify focal regions in the early stages. Assuming hundreds or thousand subjects, the saving both in time and in cost will be remarkable. Purim may be able to filter scheduled flights, scholar acceptance, popular international event participants. The optimal extension of Purim outcome is growing as the inverse of the epidemia expansion. Therefore, the earlier, the better.	0

615	Teledermatology has developed rapidly in recent years. 1 As public health guidance 4 endorses social distancing, this modality can aid physicians and patients during the COVID 19 5 emergency to overcome barriers in access to care. 2 Mitigating the spread of contagion places 6 patients at a difficult impasse: receiving care while minimizing exposure. This is especially true 7 for dermatology patients who often require ongoing care and use long term immunomodulatory 8 medications. 9 Recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and some major 10 private payers including UnitedHealthCare, Cigna, and Aetna have expanded telehealth coverage 11 during this pandemic. Additionally, CMS has issued a 1135 waiver providing compensation for 12 office, hospital, and other visits delivered via telehealth, including in patients' own homes. 13 Potential penalties for HIPAA violations when serving patients in good faith via FaceTime, 14 Skype, and other commonplace communication modalities also will be waived during this 15 emergency. 16 Since its inception, teledermatology has aided in triaging, diagnosing, and managing 17 many dermatologic conditions, ranging from inflammatory to neoplastic. 1 While the current 18 social distancing guidelines impede in person assessments, dermatologists can utilize 19 teledermatology for routine follow up and triage of urgent concerns, subsequently setting up in 20 person appointments, if needed. In addition, teledermatology can reach patients of various 21 socioeconomic levels who would otherwise not seek a dermatologist during this crisis. 2 Finally, 22 the American Academy of Dermatology has released guidance facilitating teledermatology 23 implementation. 3	0

619	"Objectives: As of the early April 2020, the antimalarial drug, chloroquine, has been approved as an emergency treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 in the United States and in Europe.
Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated these adverse events (AEs) using a large self reporting database.
We conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FAERS database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model.
We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited.
There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation.
Conclusion: Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID 19."	0
620	"Background: False negative results of SARS CoV 2 nucleic acid detection pose threats to COVID 19 patients and medical workers alike.
Objective: To develop multivariate models to determine clinical characteristics that contribute to false negative results of SARS CoV 2 nucleic acid detection, and use them to predict false negative results as well as time windows for testing positive.
Design: Retrospective Cohort Study (Ethics number of Tongji Hospital
Measurements: Clinical information on CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinic symptoms were collected. A multivariate logistic regression was used to explain and predict false negative testing results of SARS CoV 2 detection. A multivariate accelerated failure model was used to analyze and predict delayed time windows for testing positive.
Results: Of the 1,324 outpatients who diagnosed of COVID 19, 633 patients tested positive in their first SARS CoV 2 nucleic acid test (47.8%), with a mean age of 51 years (SD=14.9); the rest, which had a mean age of 47 years (SD=15.4), tested negative in the first test. ""Ground glass opacity"" in a CT imaging report was associated with a lower chance of false negatives (aOR, 0.56), and reduced the length of time window for testing positive by 26%. ""Consolidation"" was associated with a higher chance of false negatives (aOR, 1.57), and extended the length of time window for testing positive by 44%. In blood routine tests, basophils (aOR, 1.28) and eosinophils (aOR, 1.29) were associated with a higher chance of false negatives, and were found to extend the time window for testing positive by 23% and 41%, respectively. Age and gender also affected the significantly.
Limitation: Data were generated in a large single center study.
Testing outcome and positive window of SARS CoV 2 detection for COVID 19 patients were associated with CT imaging results, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms. Taking into account relevant information in CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms helped reduce a false negative testing outcome. The predictive AFT model, what we believe to be one of the first statistical models for predicting time window of SARS CoV 2 detection, could help clinicians improve the accuracy and efficiency of the diagnosis, and hence, optimizes the timing of nucleic acid detection and alleviates the shortage of nucleic acid detection kits around the world.

However, the mechanisms responsible for infection and molecular evolution of this virus remained unclear. 5 Methods: We collected and analyzed 120 genomic sequences of 2019 nCoV including 11 novel genomes from patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis of the available genome sequences of 2019 nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019 nCoV relative to other coronaviruses. 10 Results: Systematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019 nCoV revealed cocirculation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to trace the 2019 nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although 2019 nCoV, human and bat SARS CoV share high homologous in overall genome structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities 15
through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019 nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site.
Our studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and spread of the 2019 nCoV. Our results provided evidence suggesting that 2019 nCoV 20 may increase its infectivity through the receptor binding domain recombination and a cleavage site insertion. author/funder.

To release social panic and guide future schedules, this article proposes a novel mathematical model, the Delay Differential Epidemic Analyzer (D 2 EA), to analyze the dynamics of epidemic and forecast its future trends. Based on the traditional Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model, the D 2 EA model innovatively introduces a set of quarantine states and applies both ordinary differential equations and delay differential equations to describe the transition between two states. Potential variations of practical factors are further considered to reveal the true epidemic picture. In the experiment part, we use the D 2 EA model to simulate the epidemic in Hubei Province. Fitting to the collected real data as non linear optimization, the D 2 EA model forecasts that the accumulated confirmed infected cases in Hubei Province will reach the peak at the end of February and then steady down. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the quarantine measures and schedule the date to reopen Hubei Province.

Farmers attempting to reduce first calving age (FCA) need to understand which rearing management factors influence FCA and first lactation milk production (FLP). Reduced FCA might be associated with lower FLP. This study describes the association between herd FCA, FLP, and several herd level health and rearing management variables and describes the association between FCA and FLP at the cow level. It uses data from a 2010 survey of 100 Dutch dairy farms about general management, colostrum and milk feeding, housing, cleanliness, healthcare, disease, and breeding. It also used available data on FCA and 305 d FLP at both cow and herd level. The associations between median FCA and median FLP of the herd and herd level health and rearing management variables were determined using multivariate regression analysis. The median FCA was associated with minimum age of first insemination, feeding of waste milk, and the amount of milk given preweaning. The median FLP was associated with median FCA and vaccination status for bovine respiratory syncytial virus. The association between FCA and FLP (based on 8,454 heifers) was analyzed with a single effect linear mixed model, where the dependent variable was either FCA or relative FCA (defined as the difference between FCA of the heifer and median FCA of the herd to which they belonged). Heifers having an FCA of 24 mo produced, on average, 7,164 kg of milk per 305 d, and calving 1 mo earlier gave 143 kg less milk per 305 d. When FCA did not deviate from the median herd FCA, heifers produced, on average, 7,272 kg of milk per 305 d. From the median FCA of the herd, heifers calving 1 mo earlier produced 90 kg of milk per 305 d less, and heifers calving 1 mo later produced 86 kg per 305 d more. This is the first study that explained FLP using relative FCA. It assumes that heifers raised within the same farm have similar development because they are similarly managed. Similar management is reflected by the median FCA of the herd, with a deviation of the heifer's FCA from median FCA reflecting the heifer's development relative to the herd's average. The advantage of using relative FCA was that it accounts for between farm differences in rearing management. It showed that earlier insemination without adjusting management to ensure sufficient development lowers FLP. An economic optimum exists between rearing costs, FCA, and FLP and, as a consequence, care."	0
627	"Background Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures.
Methods From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS CoV 2 cases and 1286 close contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital.
Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20 22). Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1 5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1 2·7). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49 26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43 34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1 13·8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7·4% in children <10 years vs population average of 6·6%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3 0·5), with a mean serial interval of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2 7·6).
Interpretation Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS CoV 2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control."	0

630	In this paper, we describe the results of analyzing a large scale survey, called the Covid19Impact survey, to assess citizens' feedback on four areas related to the COVID 19 pandemic in Spain: social contact behavior, financial impact, working situation and health status. A total of 24 questions cover the areas of demographics, their home situation, social contact behavior, personal economic impact, their workplace situation and their health. The survey was responded to by 146,728 participants over a period of 44 hours. Such a large response enables us to gain new insights, as well as an unprecedented glimpse at respondents' personal experiences and concerns during the current COVID 19 pandemic. From the analysis, we draw implications for the design of public policies related to the management of the COVID 19 pandemic.	1

The dynamics is governed by a single functional delay differential equation, which, in the case of a large population, can be solved exactly, even in the presence of a time dependent infection rate. This delay model has a higher degree of accuracy than the so called SIR model, commonly used in epidemiology, which, instead, is formulated in terms of a set of three ordinary differential equations. We apply our model to describe the outbreak of the new virus COVID 19 in Italy, taking into account the containment measures implemented by the government in order to mitigate the spreading of the virus and the social costs for the population.	1

635	"SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV share a common human receptor ACE2. Protein protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike RBD of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ACE2. In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses' similar binding affinities to ACE2. The above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the SARS CoV 2 outbreak. Potent ACE2 blocking SARS CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross binding and neutralizing activities to SARS CoV 2. ACE2 non blocking SARS CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS CoV, showed positive cross neutralizing activities to SARS CoV 2 with an unknown mechanism. These findings suggest a trade off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the possibilities and challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against SARS CoV 2 and its future mutants.
Various estimates and analyses suggest SARS CoV 2 and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) may have similar transmissibility with an estimated reproductive number (R 0 ) of 3.77 (2.23 4.82) for SARS CoV 2 and between 2.9 3.3 for SARS CoV 8 .
SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV share a common host cell receptor protein, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed on epithelial cells in the respiratory track system and various human organs, such as the lung 9,10 . Receptor recognition by coronaviruses is the first and essential step for infecting host cells 11,12 . An envelope anchored trimeric spike (S) protein mediates the binding of the two coronaviruses to human ACE2 13,14 , and is cleaved by the host protease into two separate polypeptides as S1, which contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), and S2, which is responsible for the homotrimer formation and mediates fusion of the virion with cellular membranes 15 . The receptor binding motif (RBM) in RBD is responsible for direct binding to ACE2 and its binding affinity may directly affects the virus infectivity and transmissibility 16, 17 . The amino acid sequence homology between SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2 approximates to 75% for the spike proteins, and are 73.7% and 50.0% for RBDs and RBMs, respectively.

637	"1 Background Since December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel 2 coronavirus (2019 nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China. The exponential increase of 3 the confirmed number of cases of 2019n CoV is of great concern to the global 4 community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted 5 diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and 6 support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak.
7 We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 8 2019 nCoV outbreak. 9 Methods An anonymous Internet based, cross sectional survey was administered on 10 January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or 11 working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in 12 information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and 13 treatment seeking behaviors were queried. 14 Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the 15 information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the 16 local government. A high uptake of 2019 nCoV preventive measures was found, 17 particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under 18 quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) 19 and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both 20 strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority 21 of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital 22 treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n CoV.

639	Pandemics have threatened human race many a times. One of the most important tasks during a pandemic is to bring awareness among people. Bringing awareness contributes a lot in controlling any pandemic. Covid 19 has been causing severe loss to the human race. Considering the mode of spread and the level of severity of this disease, it is extremely important to make people aware of various safety precautions such as using sanitizers and masks and maintaining social distancing, that are to be followed to prevent the disease and break the chain of spread. This mode of educating individuals about the disease is being widely carried out as announcements through online or physical awareness campaigns, advertisements in the media and so on. The younger generations in the present day spend considerably more time on mobile phones and games. However, there are very few mobile applications or games, aimed to bring awareness about a pandemic, which is much lesser in case of Covid 19. Also, considering the lockdown scenario across the world, games also act as a good pass time indoors. Hence, we propose a 2D survival based game, SurviveCovid 19, aimed to educate people about safety precautions to be taken for Covid 19 outside their homes, by incorporating social distancing and usage of masks and sanitizers in the game. SurviveCovid 19 has been designed as an Android based mobile game and has been evaluated through a remote qualitative user survey, with 20 volunteers. The results of the survey are promising 3.6.	0
640	Accurate segmentation of lung and infection in COVID 19 CT scans plays an important role in the quantitative management of patients. Most of the existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare current COVID 19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics. In this paper, we created a COVID 19 3D CT dataset with 20 cases that contains 1800  annotated slices and made it publicly available. To promote the development of annotation efficient deep learning methods, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation that contain current main research interests, e.g., few shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide unified training, validation and testing dataset splits, and evaluation metrics and corresponding code. In addition, we provided more than 40 pre trained baseline models for the benchmarks, which not only serve as out ofthe box segmentation tools but also save computational time for researchers who are interested in COVID 19 lung and infection segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the largest public annotated COVID 19 CT volume dataset, the first segmentation benchmark, and the most pre trained models up to now. We hope these resources (https://gitee.com/junma11/ COVID 19 CT Seg Benchmark) could advance the development of deep learning methods for COVID 19 CT segmentation with limited data.	0

644	"Since the beginning of 2020, COVID 19 is the most urgent and challenging task for the international scientific community, in order to identify its behaviour, track its progress and plan effective mitigation policies. In this study, Greece is the main focus for assessing the national outbreak and estimating the general trends and outlook of it. Multiple data analytics procedures, spectral decomposition and curve fitting formulations are developed based on the data available at hand. Standard SIEQRDP epidemic modelling is applied for Greece and for the general region around it, providing hints for the outbreak progression in the mid and long term, for various infections under reporting rates. The overall short term outlook for Greece seems to be towards positive, with a downward trend in infections rate daily increase (i.e., now beyond the exponential growth rate), a possible peak within a few days beyond April 14th, as well as the high availability level of ICU w.r.t. expected demand at peak. On the negative side, the fade out period seems to be in the order of several months, with high probability of recurrent surges of the outbreak. The mitigation policies for the 'next day' should be focused on close tracking of the epidemic via large scale tests, strict border checking in international travelling and an adaptive plan for selective activation of mitigation measures when deemed necessary.

647	"Since the outbreak and rapid spread of COVID 19 starting late December 2019, it has been apparent that disease prognosis has largely been influenced by multi organ involvement.
Comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases have been the most common risk factors for severity and mortality. The hyperinflammatory response of the body, coupled with the plausible direct effects of SARS CoV 2 on body wide organs via ACE2, has been associated with complications of the disease. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, renal failure, liver damage, shock and multi organ failure have precipitated death. Acknowledging the comorbidities and potential organ injuries throughout the course of COVID 19 is therefore crucial in the clinical management of patients. This paper aims to add onto the ever emerging landscape of medical knowledge on COVID 19, encapsulating its multi organ impact."	1

The United States government has identified the health care sector as part of the critical infrastructure for homeland security to protect citizens against health risks arising from terrorism, natural disasters, and epidemics. Citizens also have expectations about the role that health care plays in enjoying a good quality of life, by providing response systems to handle emergencies and other illness situations adequately.
Among the systems required to support desired performance levels is a robust and resilient pharmaceutical supply chain that is free of disruption. Shortages of drugs place undue pressure on healthcare providers to devise alternative approaches to administer patient care. With climate change expected to result in increasingly severe weather patterns in the future, it is critical that logistics engineers understand the impact that a catastrophic weather event could have on supply chain disruption to facilitate the design of supply systems that are robust and resilient. This study investigates the main causal and intermediate events that led to risk propagation in, and disruption of, the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain following Hurricane Maria. A causality Bayesian model is developed to depict linkages between risk events and quantify the associated cumulative risk. The quantification is further examined through different advanced techniques such as predictive inference reasoning and sensitivity analysis. The general interpretation of these analyses suggests that port resilience is imperative to pharmaceutical supply chain performance in the case of Puerto Rico."	0

650	"Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f Neutrophils are the main cells of the innate immunity system. One of the mechanisms of neutrophils action is the formation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) [1]. Brinkman was the first to report the release of NETs in 2004 [2]. The discovery of NETs has spawned a new field of research in granulocytes investigation. NETs are composed of nuclear chromatin, associated with nuclear histones and granular antimicrobial proteins. They are scaffolds, ideal for retaining microbes. The main function of NETs is trapping and killing pathogens, as such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoa [1,2]. The trapping within DNA fibres prevents the spread of pathogens and facilitates the concentration of antimicrobial factors at the infection site [1].
The process of NETs generation, called NETosis, is a specific type of cell death, different from necrosis and apoptosis. It is a multi step cell death program: enzymes from granules translocate to the nucleus and facilitate chromatin de condensation. Then, internal membranes break down, and cytolysis releases NETs.
Both the nuclear and granular membranes disintegrate during NETosis, but plasmatic membrane integrity is maintained. This is in contrast to apoptosis or necrosis. NETosis is associated with disintegration of the nuclear envelope and mixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic material, loss of internal membranes and the disappearance of cytoplasmic organelles. More precisely, no peculiar signs of apoptosis are observed (membrane blebs, phosphatidylserine exposure, nuclear chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation).
NETosis resembles necrosis in that both membranes are not intact, allowing intracellular proteins to leak outside the cells."	0
651	The epidemic curve and the final extent of the COVID 19 pandemic are usually predicted from the rate of early exponential raising using the SIR model. These predictions implicitly assume a full social mixing, which is not plausible generally. Here I am showing a counterexample to the these predictions, based on random propagation of an epidemic in Barabási Albert scale free network models. The start of the epidemic suggests R 0 = 2.6, but unlike Ω ≈ 70% predicted by the SIR model, they reach a final extent of only Ω ≈ 4% without external mitigation. Daily infection rate at the top of the curve is also an order of magnitude less than in SIR models. Quarantining only the 1.5% most active superspreaders has similar effect on extent and top infection rate as blind quarantining a random 50% of the full community.	0

In such a pandemic situation, it is important to protect medical staffs and use resources such as personal protective equipment (PPE) safely and efficiently. The CDC guidelines recommend applying a United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered disinfectant against SARS CoV 2 for environmental cleaning and disinfection in healthcare settings, including those patient care areas where aerosol generating procedures were performed.5 Oxivir® Tb solution, an enhanced hydrogen peroxide disinfectant, is one of the EPA registered disinfectants.9 Also, the KCDC guidelines recommend the use of Oxivir® Tb solution, too.78 This disinfectant was made with 0.5% enhanced action formulation of hydrogen peroxide."	0

655	We discovered that the time evolution of the inverse fractional daily growth of new infections, N/∆ N , in the current outbreak of COVID 19 is accurately described by a universal function, namely the two parameter Gumbel cumulative function, in all countries that we have investigated. While the two Gumbel parameters, as determined bit fits to the data, vary from country to country (and even within different regions of the same country), reflecting the diversity and efficacy of the adopted containment measures, the functional form of the evolution of ∆ N/N appears to be universal. The result of the fit in a given region or country appears to be stable against variations of the selected time interval. This makes it possible to robustly estimate the two parameters from the data data even over relatively small time periods. In turn, this allows one to predict with large advance and well controlled confidence levels, the time of the peak in the daily new infections, its magnitude and duration (hence the total infections), as well as the time when the daily new infections decrease to a pre set value (e.g. less than about 2 new infections per day per million people), which can be very useful for planning the reopening of economic and social activities. We use this formalism to predict and compare these key features of the evolution of the COVID 19 disease in a number of countries and provide a quantitative assessment of the degree of success in in their efforts to countain the outbreak.	0

658	"Purpose of review: Preprint servers including arXiv and bioRxiv have disrupted the scientific communication landscape by providing rapid access to pre  peer reviewed research. MedRxiv is a recently launched free online repository for preprints in the health sciences. We sought to summarize potential benefits and risks to preprint server use, from both the researcher and end  user perspective, and evaluate the uptake of preprint servers in the nephrology community.
We performed a rapid review of articles describing preprint servers and their use. We approached the 20 highest impact nephrology journals regarding their policy towards the use of preprint servers. We evaluated the average time from study completion to publication of impactful articles in nephrology. Finally, we evaluated the number of nephrology articles submitted to preprint servers. Findings: To date over 600 kidney  related articles have been uploaded to bioRxiv and medRxiv. The average time from study completion to publication was over 10 months. 16 of the top 20 nephrology journals currently accept research submitted to a preprint server. Transparency and collaboration, visibility and recognition, and rapid dissemination of results were identified as benefits of preprint servers. Concerns exist regarding the potential risk of non  peer reviewed medical research being publicly available. Limitations: Preprint servers remain a recent phenomenon in health sciences and their long term impact on the medical literature remains to be seen. Implications: The quantity of research submitted to preprint servers is likely to continue to grow. The model for dissemination of research results will need to adapt to incorporate preprint servers.

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.
Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).
On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human to human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

The situation has drawn international attention, including from the virology community. We applaud the rapid release to the public of the genome sequence of the new virus by Chinese virologists, but we also believe that increased transparency on disease reporting and data sharing with international colleagues are crucial for curbing the spread of this newly emerging virus to other parts of the world.
It is now clear that the mysterious respiratory illness in Wuhan is caused by a new type of coronavirus distantly related to the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) [1, 2] . We applaud the rapid release to the public of the genome sequence of the new virus by Chinese virologists [3], as this represents an important first step in curbing the spread of the new virus to other parts of the world.
Viruses emerge and re emerge globally without consideration for borders. In the recent past, we have witnessed outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, Chikungunya, and Zika [4] . With each new outbreak, lives are lost, and the world is placed on high alert. Lessons have been learned from the initial coverup and misidentification of the SARS pathogen in 2003 [5, 6] , and the recent slow response of the World Health Organization to the 2014 2015 Ebola outbreak [7] . From this perspective, it is understandable that Chinese scientists cautiously released the identity and genome sequence of this new virus [3] . However, transparency on disease reporting to the public and data sharing with international colleagues must continue. With an increasing number of new cases of infection by the new coronavirus reported in China and neighboring countries, such as Japan and Thailand [8], human to human transmission should be thoroughly investigated."	0

The multi agent description leads to study the evolution over time of a system of kinetic equations for the wealth densities of susceptible, infectious and recovered individuals, whose proportions are driven by a classical compartmental model in epidemiology. Explicit calculations show that the spread of the disease seriously affects the distribution of wealth, which, unlike the situation in the absence of epidemics, can converge towards a stationary state with a bimodal form. Furthermore, simulations confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomena characteristics of economic trends in situations compromised by the rapid spread of an epidemic, such as the unequal impact on the various wealth classes and the risk of a shrinking middle class. 1 arXiv:2004.13620v1 [physics.soc ph] 28 Apr 2020 J (t) J ∈ {S, I, R} the solution to the system (4) (6) with initial datum f ∞ J J ∈ {S, I, R}, thus satisfying (25).

This innovative and general procedure, based on the representation of the molecular iso electron density surface in terms of 2D Zernike polynomials, allows the rapid and quantitative assessment of the geometrical shape complementarity between interacting proteins, that was unfeasible with previous methods. We first tested the method with a large dataset of known protein complexes obtaining an overall area under the ROC curve of 0.76 in the blind recognition of binding sites and then applied it to investigate the features of the interaction between the Spike protein of SARS CoV 2 and human cellular receptors. Our results indicate that SARS CoV 2 uses a dual strategy: its spike protein could also interact with sialic acid receptors of the cells in the upper airways, in addition to the known interaction with Angiotensin converting enzyme 2.	1
668	Background: Thrombocytopenia has been implicated in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, while the association of platelet count and changes with subsequent mortality remains unclear. Methods: The clinical and laboratory data of 383 patients with the definite outcome by March 1, 2020 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan were reviewed. The association between platelet parameters and mortality risk was estimated by utilizing Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results: Among the 383 patients, 334 (87.2%) were discharged and survived, and 49 (12.8%) died. Thrombocytopenia at admission was associated with mortality of almost three times as high as that for those without thrombocytopenia (P < 0.05). Cox regression analyses revealed that platelet count was an independent risk factor associated with in hospital mortality in a dose dependent manner. An increment of per 50 × 10 9 /L in platelets was associated with a 40% decrease in mortality (hazard ratio: 0.60, 95%CI: 0.43, 0.84). Dynamic changes of platelets were also closely related to death during mortality.	0
669	"This paper introduces a microscopic approach to model epidemics, which can explicitly consider the consequences of individual's decisions on the spread of the disease. We first formulate a microscopic multi agent epidemic model where every agent can choose its activity level that affects the spread of the disease. Then by minimizing agents' cost functions, we solve for the optimal decisions for individual agents in the framework of game theory and multi agent reinforcement learning. Given the optimal decisions of all agents, we can make predictions about the spread of the disease. We show that there are negative externalities in the sense that infected agents do not have enough incentives to protect others, which then necessitates external interventions to regulate agents' behaviors. In the discussion section, future directions are pointed out to make the model more realistic. 2 2 This paper is adapted from the lecture notes for Lectures 20 of 16 899 Adaptive Control and Reinforcement Learning (Spring 2020) at CMU.

is R0, the regeneration number, which tells how fast the disease can spread. R0 can be regressed from data.
Limitations of Existing Models Although these models are useful in predicting the spread of epidemics, they lack the granularity needed for analyzing individual behaviors during an epidemic and understanding the relationship between individual decisions and the spread of the disease. 5 For example, many countries now announced However, their effects are very different across different countries, or even across different counties in the same country. One factor that can possibly explain these differences is the cultural difference. In different cultures, individuals make different choices. For instance, in the west, people exhibit greater inertia to give up their working/life routines so that they do not follow the orders seriously. While in the east, people tend to obey the rules better. These different individual choices can result in significantly different outcomes in disease propagation that cannot be captured by a macroscopic model.
In this paper, we develop a microscopic epidemic model by explicitly considering individual decisions and the interaction among different individuals in the population, in the framework of multi agent systems. The aforementioned cultural difference can be understood as a difference in agents' cost functions, which then affect their behaviors when they are trying to minimize their cost functions.

670	14 COVID 19 pandemic has resulted so far 14,395,16 confirmed cases with 85,711 deaths from the 15 212 countries, or territories. Due to multifacet issues and challenges in implementation of the 16 safety & preventive measures, inconsistent coordination between societies governments and 17 most importanly lack of specific vaccine to SARS CoV 2, the spread of Wuhan originated virus 18 is still uprising after taking a heavy toll on human life. In the present study, we mapped several 19 immunogenic epitopes (B cell, T cell, and IFN gamma) over the entire structural proteins of 20 SARS CoV 2 and by applying various computational and immunoinformatics approaches, we 21 designed a multi epitope peptide based vaccine that predicted high immunogenic response in the 22 largest proportion of world's human population. To ensure high expression of the recombinant 23 vaccine in E. coli, codon optimization and in silico cloning were also carried out. The designed 24 vaccine with high molecular affinity to TLR3 and TLR4, was found capable to initiate effective 25 innate and adaptive immune response. The immune simulation also suggested uprising high 26 levels of both B cell and T cell mediated immunity which on subsequent exposure cleared 27 antigen from the system. The proposed vaccine found promising by yielding desired results and 28 hence, should be tested by practical 2.	0

672	Objective: To test the hypothesis that knowledge of COVID 19 influences participation in different behaviors including self reports of purchasing more goods than usual, attending large gatherings, and using medical masks. Methods: Cross sectional online survey of 1,034 U.S. residents age 18  conducted on March 17, 2020. Results: For every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (OR=0.88, 95% CI:0.81 0.95), attending large gatherings (OR=0.87, 95%CI: 0.81 0.93), and using medical masks (OR=0.56, 95% CI:0.50 0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively. Gen X and Millennial participants had 56% to 76% higher odds, respectively, of increased purchasing behavior, compared to Baby Boomers. Results suggest politicization of response recommendations. Democrats had 30% lower odds of attending large gatherings (OR=0.70, 95% CI:0.50 0.97), and 48% lower Republicans.	0
673	Mobile geolocation data is a valuable asset in the assessment of movement patterns of a population. Once a highly contagious disease takes place in a location the movement patterns aid in predicting the potential spatial spreading of the disease, hence mobile data becomes a crucial tool to epidemic models. In this work, based on millions of anonymized mobile visits data in Brazil, we investigate the most probable spreading patterns of the COVID 19 within states of Brazil. The study is intended to help public administrators in action plans and resources allocation, whilst studying how mobile geolocation data may be employed as a measure of population mobility during an epidemic. The first part of the study focus on the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro during the period of March 2020, when the disease first started to spread in these states. Metapopulation models for the disease spread were simulated in order to evaluate the risk of infection of each city within the states, by ranking them according to the time the disease will take to infect each city. We observed that, although the high risk regions are those closer to the capital cities, where the outbreak has started, there are also cities in the countryside with great risk.	0

677	The potential for acute shortages of ventilators at the peak of the Covid 19 pandemic has raised the possibility of needing to support two patients from a single ventilator. To provide a system for understanding and prototyping designs we have developed a mathematical model of two patients supported by a mechanical ventilator. We propose a standard setup where we simulate the introduction of T splitters to supply air to two patients and a modified setup where we introduce a variable resistance in each inhalation pathway and one way valves in each exhalation pathway. Using the standard setup, we demonstrate that ventilating two patients with mismatched lung compliances from a single ventilator will lead to clinically significant reductions in tidal volume in the patient with the lowest respiratory compliance. Using the modified setup, we demonstrate that it could be possible to achieve the same tidal volumes in two patients with mismatched lung compliances, and we show that the tidal volume of one patient can be manipulated independently of the other. The results indicate that, with appropriate modifications, two patients could be supported from a single ventilator with independent control of tidal volumes.	0
678	"The novel coronavirus pneumonia, namely COVID 19, has become a global Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f public health problem. Previous studies have found that air pollution is a risk factor for respiratory infection by carrying microorganisms and affecting body's immunity. This study aimed to explore the relationship between ambient air pollutants and the infection caused by the novel coronavirus. Daily confirmed cases, air pollution concentration and meteorological variables in 120 cities were obtained from January 23, 2020 to February 29, 2020 in China. We applied a generalized additive model to investigate the associations of six air pollutants (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , CO, NO 2 and O 3 ) with COVID 19 confirmed cases. We observed significantly positive associations of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 and O 3 in the last two weeks with newly COVID 19 confirmed cases. A 10 μg/m 3 increase (lag0 14) in PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , and O 3 was associated with a 2.24% (95% CI:
1.02 to 3.46), 1.76% (95% CI: 0.89 to 2.63), 6.94% (95% CI: 2.38 to 11.51), and 4.76% (95% CI: 1.99 to 7.52) increase in the daily counts of confirmed cases, respectively. However, a 10 μg/m 3 increase (lag0 14) in SO 2 was associated with a 7.79% decrease (95% CI:  14.57 to  1.01) in COVID 19 confirmed cases. Our results indicate that there is a significant relationship between air pollution and COVID 19 infection, which could partially explain the effect of national lockdown and provide implications for the control and prevention of this novel disease."	0

When R0 is >1, it means that each individual affected by a transmittable disease is expected to infect a number of subjects that increase exponentially with the increase of the R0 value and the disease is expected to spread through the susceptible population. Nonetheless, a decreasing trend of infections emerges by the analysis of the epidemic curves provided by the authors, which may indicate the effectiveness of the control measure adopted to date.15

683	"Background: There is little published evidence on the gastrointestinal features of COVID 19. Aims: To report on the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings of patients with COVID 19, and to discuss the possibility of faecal transmission. Methods: We have reviewed gastrointestinal features of, and faecal test results in, COVID 19 from case reports and retrospective clinical studies relating to the digestive system published since the outbreak. Results: With an incidence of 3% (1/41) 79% (159/201), gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID 19 included anorexia 39.9% (55/138) 50.2% (101/201), diarrhoea 2% (2/99) 49.5% (146/295), vomiting 3.6% (5/138) 66.7% (4/6), nausea 1% (1/99) 29.4%
(59/201), abdominal pain 2.2% (3/138) 6.0% (12/201) and gastrointestinal bleeding 4% (2/52) 13.7% (10/73). Diarrhoea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom in children and adults, with a mean duration of 4.1 ± 2.5 days, and was observed before and after diagnosis. Vomiting was more prominent in children. About 3.6%
(5/138) 15.9% (32/201) of adult and 6.5% (2/31) 66.7% (4/6) of children patients presented vomiting. Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found. Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in nonsevere patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion with gastrointestinal symptoms was similar in severe and nonsevere cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and virus nucleocapsid protein were detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from faeces. Faecal PCR testing was as accurate as respiratory specimen PCR detection.
In 36% (5/14) 53% (39/73) faecal PCR became positive, 2 5 days later than sputum PCR positive. Faecal excretion persisted after sputum excretion in 23% (17/73) 82% (54/66) patients for 1 11 days."	0

687	An important task during the current Covid 19 pandemic is to predict the remainder of the epidemic, both without preventive measures and with. In the current paper we address this question using a simple estimation prediction method. The input is the observed initial doubling time and a known value of R 0 . The simple General epidemic model is then fitted, and time calibration to calendar time is done using the observed number of case fatalities, together with estimates of the time between infection to death and the infection fatality risk. Finally, predictions are made assuming no change of behaviour, as well as for the situation where preventive measures are put in place at one specific time point. The overall effect of the preventive measures is assumed to be known, or else estimated from the observed increased doubling time after preventive measures are put in place. The predictions are highly sensitive to the doubling times without and with preventive measures, sensitive to R 0 , but less sensitive to the estimates used for time calibration: observed number of case fatalities, typical time between infection and death, and the infection fatality risk. The method is applied to the urban area of Stockholm, and predictions show that the peak May.	0

689	The new decade of the 21 st century (2020) started with the emergence of a novel coronavirus known as SARS CoV 2 that caused an epidemic of coronavirus disease in Wuhan, China. It is the third highly pathogenic and transmissible coronavirus after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) emerged in humans. The source of origin, transmission to humans, and mechanisms associated with the pathogenicity of SARS CoV 2 are not yet clear, however, its resemblance to SARS CoV and several other bat coronaviruses was recently confirmed through genome sequencing related studies. The development of therapeutic strategies is necessary in order to prevent further epidemics and cure infections. In this review, we summarize current information about the emergence, origin, diversity, and epidemiology of three pathogenic coronaviruses with a specific focus on the current outbreak in Wuhan, China. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical features and potential therapeutic options that may be effective against SARS CoV 2.	1

691	"23 BACKGROUND 24 The ongoing worldwide outbreak of the 2019 nCoV is markedly similar to the severe acute 25 respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago. During the 2002 2003 SARS outbreak, 26 healthcare workers formed a special population of patients. Although virus specific IgG play 27 important roles in virus neutralization and prevention against future infection, limited information is 28 available regarding the long term persistence of IgG after infection with SARS like coronavirus.
29
METHODS
A long term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS CoV infected healthcare workers from a 31 hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002 2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, 32 with a 13 year follow up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003 2015. Twenty 33 SARS CoV infected and 40 non infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum 34 samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a 35 recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS CoV, as a diagnostic antigen.
36
RESULTS
Anti SARS CoV IgG was found to persist for up to 12 years. IgG titers typically peaked in 2004,
declining rapidly from 2004 2006, and then continued to decline at a slower rate. IgG titers in 39 .

Patients 40 treated with corticosteroids at the time of infection were found to have lower IgG titers than those 41 without. 42 CONCLUSIONS 43 IgG antibodies against SARS CoV can persist for at least 12 years. The presence of SARS CoV IgG 44 might provide protection against SARS CoV and other betacoronavirus. This study provides valuable 45 information regarding humoral immune responses against SARS CoV and the 2019 nCoV.

693	"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 has surprised the world since the beginning of 2020, and the rapid growth of COVID 19 is beyond the capability of doctors and hospitals that could deal in many areas. The chest computed tomography (CT) could be serve as an effective tool in detection of COVID 19. Its valuable to develop automatic detection of COVID 19.
The collected dataset consisted of 521 COVID 19 chest CT images, 397 normal chest CT images, 76 bacterial pneumonia chest CT images and 48 SARS chest CT images obtained by exhaustively searching available data on the Internet. Then, these data are divided into three sets, referred to training set, validation set and testing set. Sixteen data augmentation operations are designed to enrich the training set in deep learning training phase. Multiple experiments were conducted to analyze the performance of the model in the detection of COVID 19 both in case of no noisy labels and noisy labels. The performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Results The data augmentation operations on the training set is effective for improvement of the model performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.9689 with (95% CI: 0.9308, 1) in case of no noisy labels, while the per exam sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detecting COVID 19 in the independent testing set are 90.52%, 91.58% and 91.21%, respectively. Besides, the model is robust when part of the training samples is marked incorrectly. The AUC is 92.23% in the case of noisy labels of 10% in the training set. Conclusion A deep learning model with insufficient samples can be developed by using data augmentation in 19."	0
694	We use an established semi mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of the COVID 19 pandemic [1], driven by European mortality data, to estimate the prevalence of immunity. We allow the infection fatality ratio (IFR) to vary, adapt the model's priors to better reflect emerging information, and re evaluate the model fitting in the light of current mortality data. The results indicate that the IFR of COVID 19 may be an order of magnitude smaller than the current consensus, with the corollary that the virus is more prevalent than currently believed. These results emerge from a simple model and ought to be treated with caution. They emphasise the value of rapid community scale antibody testing when this becomes available.	0
695	Purpose: To evaluate lung abnormalities on thin section computed tomographic (CT) scans in patients with COVID 19 and correlate findings to duration of symptoms. Methods: In total, 348 CT scans in 112 patients were classified according to the time after the onset of the initial symptoms, namely stage 1 (0 4 days); stage 2 (5 9 days); stage 3 (10 14 days); stage 4 (15 21 days); stage 5 (22 28 days); and stage 6 (＞28 days). Each lung lobe was evaluated for extent affected by ground glass opacities (GGO), crazy paving pattern and consolidation, in five categories of percentual severity. Summation of scores from all five lung lobes provided the total CT score (maximal CT score, 25). Results: The predominant patterns of lung abnormalities were GGOs, crazy paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities. The frequency of crazy paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities peaked at stage 3 (62.7 %), stage 4 (75.0 %) and stage 5 (83.1 %), respectively, and decreased thereafter. Total CT scores increased from stage 1 to stage 2 (2.8 ± 3.1, vs. 6.5 ± 4.6, respectively, P < 0.01), and thereafter remained high. The lower lobes were more inclined to be involved with higher CT scores except for stage 1. At stage 6 98.1 % of CT scans still showed abnormalities (CT score 7.5 ± 4.1). Conclusion: Thin section CT could provide semi quantitative analysis of pulmonary damage severity. This disease changed rapidly at the early stage, then tended to be stable and lasted for a long time.	0
696	"objectives: COVID 19 began spreading widely in China in January 2020. Outpatient ""Fever Clinics"" (FCs), instituted during the SARS epidemic in 2003 were upgraded to provide COVID 19 screening and prevention attached to large tertiary hospitals. We sought to analyze the effect of upgraded FCs to detecting COVID 19 at our institution.
Design：A population based cross sectional study.
Participants：A total of 6,365 patients were screened in the FC. covering a period of 40 days before and after upgrading the FC. All necessary data, including baseline patient information, diagnoses, follow up conditions for critical patients, transfer information between the FC and emergency department (ED) were collected and analyzed. Results: 6,365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2,192 patients were screened before January 21, 2020, while 3,453 were screened afterwards. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. Compared to before the outbreak, patients transferred from the FC to ED decreased significantly [39.21% vs 15.75%, p<0.001] and tended to spend more time in the FC [55 vs 203mins, p<0.001]. For critically ill patients waiting for a screening result, the total length of stay in the FC was 22mins before the outbreak, compared to 442mins after the outbreak (p< 0.001). The number of in hospital deaths of critical care patients seen first in the FC was 9 of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 of 38 after (p<0.050). Nineteen COVID 19 cases were confirmed in the FC, but no other patients or medical care providers were cross infected. Conclusion: The work load of the FC increased after the COVID 19 outbreak and effectively prevented COVID 19 from spreading in the hospital，as well as offload ED resources."	0

698	In a previous note we made an analysis of the spreading of the COVID disease in Italy. We used a model based on the logistic and Hubbert functions, the analysis we exploited has shown limited usefulness in terms of predictions and failed in fixing fundamental indications like of the disease growth. In this note we elaborate on the previous model, using multi logistic models and attempt a more realistic analysis.	1
699	We develop a minimal compartmental model to analyze policies on mobility restriction in Italy during the Covid 19 outbreak. Our findings show that a premature lockdown barely shifts the epidemic in time: moreover, beyond a critical value of the lockdown strength, an epidemic that seems to be quelled fully recovers after lifting the restrictions. We investigate the effects on lockdown scenarios and exit strategies by introducing heterogeneities in the model. In particular, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative entities in which social interactions through different age classes occur. We find that, due to the sparsity of the mobility matrix, epidemics develop independently in different regions once the outbreak starts. Moreover, after the epidemics ha started, the influence of contacts with other regions becomes soon irrelevant. Sparsity might be responsible for the observed delays among different regions. Analogous arguments apply to the world/countries scenario. We also find that disregarding the structure of social contacts could lead to severe underestimation of the post lockdown effects. Nevertheless, age class based strategies can help to mitigate rebound effects with milder strategies. Finally, we point out that these results can be generalized beyond this particular model by providing a description of the effects of key parameters on non medical epidemic mitigation strategies.	0

704	"Over the past 20 years, several coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness. Since SARS CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions.
Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS CoV and the recent 2019 nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently permission."	0
705	"An epidemic can be characterized by its speed (i.e., the exponential growth rate r) and strength (i.e., the reproductive number R). Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for this classic, strength based paradigm and show that there is a corresponding speed based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like R = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, just as the strength based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of ""test and treat"" interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion measures."	0
706	"Despite the lockdown of Wuhan and the suspension of all public transport, flights and trains on January 23, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases, including 6,484 (16.1%) with severe illness, and 909 deaths (2.2%) had been reported in China by the National Health Commission up to February 10, 2020; meanwhile, 319 cases and one death were reported outside of China, in 24 countries [3]. Then, the optimal value of the infection rate α that fits the reported data was found by “wrapping” around the SIRD simulator an optimization algorithm (such as a nonlinear least squares solver) to solve the problem:
argminα{∑t=1M(w1ft(α;β,γ)2 w2gt(α;β,γ)2 w3ht(α;β,γ)2)},(16)
where
ft(α;β,γ)=CΔISIRD(t)−CΔI(t),gt(α;β,γ)=CΔRSIRD(t)−CΔR(t),ht(α;β,γ)=CΔDSIRD(t)−CΔD(t)
where, CΔXSIRD(t), (X = I, R, D) are the cumulative cases resulting from the SIRD simulator at time t; w1, w2, w3 correspond to scalars serving in the general case as weights to the relevant functions. These numbers are within the lower bounds and expected trends of our forecasts from the 10th of February that are based on Scenario I. Importantly, by assuming a 20 fold scaling of the confirmed cumulative number of the infected cases and a 40 fold scaling of the confirmed number of the recovered cases in the total population, forecasts show a decline of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February."	0

(2) to use these specifications as input to the construction of a system intended to meet these requirements. An important goal was to provide information about the diffusion of a communicable disease without being dependent on centralised storage of information about individual patients or revealing patient identifiable information.
The method applied is rooted in the engineering paradigm involving phases of analysis, system specification, design, implementation, and testing. The requirements were established from earlier projects' conclusions and analysis of disease outbreaks. The requirements were validated by a literature study of syndromic and disease surveillance systems. The system was tested on simulated EHR databases generated from microbiology laboratory data.
and an open source system, ""The Snow Agent system"", has been developed. The Snow Agent system is a distributed system for monitoring the status of a population's health by distributing processes to, and extracting epidemiological data directly from, the electronic health records (EHR) system in a geographic area.
Conclusions: Syndromic and disease surveillance tools should be able to operate at all levels in the health systems and across national borders. Such systems should avoid transferring patient identifiable data, support two way communications and be able to define and incorporate new and unknown diseases and syndrome definitions that should be reported by the system. The initial tests of the Snow Agent system shows that it will easily scale to national level in Norway. .no (J.G.

711	"The outbreaks of 2002/2003 SARS, 2012/2015 MERS and 2019/2020 Wuhan respiratory syndrome clearly indicate that genome evolution of an animal coronavirus (CoV) may enable it to acquire human transmission ability, and thereby to cause serious threats to global public health. It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large scale protein protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019 nCoV S protein receptor binding domain (S RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS CoV S RBD ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest energy receptor binding conformations, and hence established an experiment based strength reference for evaluating the receptor binding affinity of 2019 nCoV via comparison with SARS CoV. Our results show that this
binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS CoV, supporting that 2019 nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post genome analysis of protein control."	0

Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f way of transmission of the COVID 19 is through the respiratory system, hearing research does not seem to be on the frontlines as other areas in this pandemic.
As a matter of fact, this is not true, but a more integrated strategy is requested, and, in Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 3 response to the manuscript ""Hearing loss and COVID 19: A note"" 7 , we would like to evidence other aspects. Some cultural associations in Italy have denounced the problems that patients suffering from hearing impairments have understanding and communicating with the health personnel constantly wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), especially when they have to go to the emergency room for any need. Face masks represent an ally in the fight against COVID 19, but a challenge for patients with hearing loss for two main reasons; they reduce acoustic transmission and prevent lip reading 8 . Additionally, PPE makes more uncomfortable for the patients wearing hearing devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants.
Based on this background, we report our preliminary data regarding a series of patients visited at Foggia University Hospital, a tertiary referral center in one of the hardest hit provinces of Southern Italy, after the identification of the first Italian case on the 20 th February 2020. Fifty nine patients (37 males, 22 females; median age 60) with mild to profound grades of hearing impairment who were referred from the Emergency Department for urgent ORL consultations were included in this study.
Among the conditions treated there were: epistaxis, dyspnea, tonsillitis, facial trauma, foreign bodies, hemoptysis. Patients were asked to classify the difficulties experienced in the emergency visit after the COVID 19 outbreak in relation to their hearing impairment as none, mild, moderate and severe. Furthermore, in regard to the use of face masks by health personnel, they were asked if they were more bothered by the reduced acoustic transmission or the impossibility of lip reading. Our results showed that 8 (13.6%) subjects did not have difficulties, 15 (25.4%) presented mild difficulties, 22 (37.3%) moderate and 14 (23.7%) severe. Interestingly, the main concern about face masks was the sound attenuation for 26 (44.1%) subjects and the impossibility of lip reading for 33 (55.9%).
Although these data are just preliminary, they shed light on the problems that people affected by hearing loss are experiencing during these difficult times. Many solutions have been proposed internationally so far (i.e. speech to text mobile apps, written scripts, masks with a plastic panel over the mouth) 9 , but their application in medical daily routine is still limited and has to be tested yet. In conclusion, further research to provide effective solutions and global strategies is needed.

715	"Purpose. The purpose of this study was to find out risk factors associated with pneumonia, 35 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and clinical outcome among patients with 2019 36 novel coronavirus disease .
Methods. This was a cross sectional multicenter clinical study. A total of 95 patients infected 38 with COVID 19 were enrolled. The COVID 19 diagnostic standard was PCR detection of 39 target genes of 2019 novel coronavirus(2019 nCoV). Clinical, laboratory, and radiological 40 results as well as treatment outcome data were obtained. ARDS was defined as oxygenation
Findings. Multivariate analysis showed that older age (OR=1.078, P=0.008) and high BMI 43 (OR=1.327, P=0.024) were independent risk factor associated with patients with pneumonia.
For patients with ARDS, multivariate analysis showed that only high systolic blood pressure 45 (SBP) level (OR=1.046, P=0.025) and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (OR=1.010, 46 P=0.021) were independent risk factors associated with ARDS. A total of 70 patients were 47 conducted CT scan repeatedly after treatment. Patients were divided in disease exacerbation 48 group (n=19) and disease relieve group (n=51). High BMI (OR=1.285, P=0.017) and tobacco 49 smoking (OR=16.13, P=0.032) were independent risk factors associated with disease 50 exacerbation after treatment. 51 Implications. Our results help to risk stratification in patients with 2019 nCoV infection. 52 Patients with risk factors should be given timely intervention to avoid disease progression. 53 , several cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology have been 65 found in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China 1 . Those cases have been confirmed as acute 66 respiratory infections caused by a novel coronavirus infection. To date, confirmed cases have 93 Dongguan People's Hospital and Nanfang hospital, Southern Medical University from 94 January 2020 to February 2020 were enrolled. Our study population is hospitalized patients. 95 Because COVID 19 is an infectious disease, all outpatients are forced to be quarantined in 96 the hospital if they were confirmed infected with 2019 nCoV. Oral consent was obtained 97 from patients. The 2019 nCoV infection diagnostic standard was polymerase chain reaction 98 detection of two target genes of 2019 nCoV, including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and 99 nucleocapsid protein (N). A positive result was determined to be 209 nCoV infection.

The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197 amino acid fragment of the 1273 amino acid S protein protomer. Antibodies to the RBD domain of SARS CoV (SARS CoV 1), a closely related coronavirus which emerged in 2002 2003, have been shown to potently neutralize SARS CoV 1 S protein mediated entry, and the presence of anti RBD antibodies correlates with neutralization in SARS CoV 2 convalescent sera.

Based on our molecular insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the above coronaviruses, including 2019 nCoV. To develop broad spectrum anti viral agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3' blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators.	1
718	After the first infected patient detected in Wuhan, China in December, 2019 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) virus, the COVID 19 ('CO' means corona, 'VI' is virus, 'D' is disease, '19' is the year of discovery) disease spread globally due to its high contagious nature and became an ongoing pandemic. Also, the lack of vaccines and efficacious drugs to treat infected patients is a great problem to cope this pandemic. The approved drugs for similar health problems, reported potential drugs but plants extracts are investigated randomly to deal with the COVID 19 infection. Molecular docking, one of the best approach to search therapeutically potent drugs/molecules in real time with possible hope to apply on COVID 19. In this communication, molecular docking studies of 18 ligands were carried out with the three important proteins of SARS CoV 2, i.e., RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and spike glycoprotein (SGp). From the obtained results, we observed that all the tested molecules showed better dock score in compared to the hydroxychloroquine claimed to be effective against COVID 19. Combining the dock score and other medicinal properties, we believe the limonin can be further explored for potential use against COVID 19.	1
719	The SARS CoV 2 (COVID 19) novel corona virus represents a significant health risk, particularly in older patients. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in most rich countries, and delivering chemotherapy may be associated with increased risk in the presence of a pandemic infection. Estimating this risk is crucial in making decisions about balancing risks and benefits from administering chemotherapy. However, there are no specific data about chemotherapy risks per se. Here we develop a simple model to estimate the potential harms in patients undergoing chemotherapy during a COVID outbreak. We use age related case fatality rates as a basis for estimating risk, and use previous data from risk of death during influenza outbreaks to estimate the additional risk associated with chemotherapy. We use data from randomised trials to estimate benefit across a range of curative and palliative settings, and address the balance of benefit against the then use those data to estimate the impact on national chemotherapy delivery patterns.	1

721	Hospital enterprises are currently faced with anticipating the spread of COVID 19 and the effects it will have on visits, admissions, bed needs, and crucial supplies. While many studies have focused on understanding the basic epidemiology of the disease, few open source tools have been made available to aid hospitals in their planning. We developed a web based application (available at: http://covid19forecast.rush.edu/) for US states and territories that allows users to choose from a suite of models already employed in characterizing the spread of COVID 19. Users can obtain forecasts for hospital visits and admissions as well as anticipated needs for ICU and non ICU beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment supplies. Users can also customize a large set of inputs, view the variability in forecasts over time, and download forecast data. We describe our web application and its models in detail and provide recommendations and caveats for its use. Our application is primarily designed for hospital leaders, healthcare workers, and government official who may lack specialized knowledge in epidemiology and modeling. However, specialists can also use our open source code as a platform for modification and deeper study. As the dynamics of COVID 19 change, our application will also change to meet emerging needs of the healthcare community.	0
722	"T he outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has led to 95,333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. 1 In this issue of the Journal, the American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (AABIP) has provided an initial statement on the use of bronchoscopy and respiratory specimen collection in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID 19 infection. 2 This statement has received an expedited peer review by the Journal in an effort to disseminate high quality information in a clinically useful timeframe that ultimately will help patients. At this point in time much remains unknown, and evidence based guidance regarding bronchoscopy precautions and SARS CoV 2 infection will require updating as new information becomes available. But as William Osler reflected, ""Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability."" So even though there is much that is still uncertain, we need to act prudently in a timely manner rather than waiting for perfect information. The AABIP statement is an initial step in this process and it will be updated accordingly at the Web site of the AABIP (https://aabronchology.org/). Subsequent updates will also be reviewed and published in the Journal with free access to all in an expedited manner.
The AABIP statement highlights the fact that while interventional pulmonology is a procedurally oriented discipline, it remains important for physicians to be cognizant of epidemiological concepts and the context within which procedures are performed. Bronchoscopy is a tremendous tool for diagnosis and treatment of a variety of conditions, but it can also transmit disease if appropriate precautions are not followed. In the cases of SARS CoV 2, there are risks to both patients and health care providers. The AABIP statement appropriately highlights this and emphasizes that bronchoscopy is not an appropriate tool for diagnosis of SARS CoV 2 infection the benefits are far outweighed by the risks.
There are also more nuanced aspects to the epidemiology that should impact how we think about bronchoscopy in the age of COVID 19. One way to characterize infectious epidemics is to calculate the basic reproduction number, also called the basic reproductive ratio (R 0 ). R 0 is not a rate, but rather a ratio. It is the ratio of the expected number of cases directly generated by a case in a population in which all members are susceptible to the infection. 3 Note that this definition makes certain assumptions specifically that all members of the population are susceptible so R 0 technically is not changed by interventions such as vaccination. This number attempts to quantify the potential for the transmissibility of an infectious agent. While R 0 is a valid biological metric, the value itself is usually estimated with mathematical models that are in turn based on key assumptions, so interpretation of its value is complex and estimated values for the same pathogen"	0

727	Background: Similar to outbreaks of many other infectious diseases, success in controlling the novel 2019 coronavirus infection requires a timely and accurate monitoring of the epidemic, particularly during its early period with rather limited data while the need for information increases explosively. Methods: In this study, we used a second derivative model to characterize the coronavirus epidemic in China with cumulatively diagnosed cases during the first 2 months. The analysis was further enhanced by an exponential model with a close population assumption. This model was built with the data and used to assess the detection rate during the study period, considering the differences between the true infections, detectable and detected cases. Results: Results from the second derivative modeling suggest the coronavirus epidemic as nonlinear and chaotic in nature. Although it emerged gradually, the epidemic was highly responsive to massive interventions initiated on January 21, 2020, as indicated by results from both second derivative and exponential modeling analyses. The epidemic started to decelerate immediately after the massive actions. The results derived from our analysis signaled the decline of the epidemic 14 days before it eventually occurred on February 4, 2020. Study findings further signaled an accelerated decline in the epidemic starting in 14 days on February 18, 2020. Conclusions: The coronavirus epidemic appeared to be nonlinear and chaotic, and was responsive to effective interventions. The methods used in this study can be applied in surveillance to inform and encourage the general public, public health professionals, clinicians and epidemic.	0
728	The pandemic of COVID 19 is seriously challenging the medical organization in many parts of the world. This novel corona virus SARS CoV 2 has a specific tropism for the low respiratory airways, but causes severe pneumonia in a low percentage of patients. However, the rapid spread of the infection during this pandemic is causing the need to hospitalize a high number of patients. Pneumonia in COVID 19 has peculiar features and can be studied by lung ultrasound in the early approach to suspected patients. The sonographic signs are non specific when considered alone, but observation of some aspects of vertical artifacts can enhance the diagnostic power of the ultrasound examination.	0
729	The pandemic state of COVID 19 caused by the SARS CoV 2 put the world in quarantine and is causing an unprecedented economic crisis. However, COVID 19 is spreading in different rates at different countries. Here, we tested the effect of three classes of predictors, i.e., socioeconomic, climatic and transport, on the rate of daily increase of COVID 19. We found that global connections, represented by countries' importance in the global air transportation network, is the main explanation for the growth rate of COVID 19 in different countries. Climate, geographic distance and socioeconomics did not affect this big picture analysis. Geographic distance and climate were significant barriers in the past but were surpassed by the human engine that allowed us to colonize almost every corner on Earth. Based on our global analysis, the global network of air transportation could lead to a worst case scenario of synchronous global pandemic if board control measures in international airports were not taken and are not sustained during this pandemic. Despite all limitations of a global analysis, our results indicate that the current claims that the growth rate of COVID 19 may be lower in tropical countries should be taken very carefully, at risk to disturb well established and effective policy of social isolation that may help to avoid higher mortality rates due to collapse of national health systems. This is the case of Brazil, a well connected tropical country that presents the second highest increase rate of COVID 19 and might experience a serious case of human induced disasters if decision makers take into consideration unsupported claims of countries.	0
730	"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has become a serious threat to global public health.1,2 Although the virus appears to be only partially similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, all of these viral infections are responsible for severe and potentially lethal acute respiratory syndromes in humans.3 Unfortunately, to date, there are no specific/targeted drugs, or vaccines, and the number of SARS CoV 2 positive patients is growing in these infected patients had mild to moderate elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels; one patient had severely elevated serum aminotransferases (ALT of 7590 U/L, AST of 1445 U/L).5 Since COVID 19 related liver dysfunction is now attracting widespread attention, this review discusses the epidemiological characteristics, the potential mechanisms, and the treatment options for liver dysfunction induced by COVID 19.

733	The impact of the drastic reduction in travel volume within mainland China in January and February 2020 was quantified with respect to reports of novel coronavirus (COVID 19) infections outside China. Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86,449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should fallout.	0

Especially a good choice of β as the number of others that one infected person encounters per unit time (per day) influences the adequateness of the results of the model. For the example of the actual COVID 19 pandemic some aspects of the parameter choice will be discussed. Because of the incompatibility of the data of the Johns Hopkins University [3] to the data of the German Robert Koch Institut we use the COVID 19 data of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [2] (ECDC) as a base for the parameter estimation. Two different mathematical methods for the data analysis will be discussed in this paper and possible sources of trouble will be shown.
Parameters for several countries like UK, USA, Italy, Spain, Germany and China will be estimated and used in W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick's SIR model [1] . Strategies for the commencing and ending of social and economic shutdown measures are discussed.

739	A pandemic of a novel Coronavirus emerged in December of 2019 , causing devastating public health impact across the world. In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals, strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, contact tracing, quarantine, isolation and the use of face masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by R c ), is less than unity. This equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, for a special case of the model where quarantined susceptible individuals do not acquire COVID 19 infection during quarantine, when R c is less than unity. The epidemiological consequence of this theoretical result is that, the community wide implementation of control interventions that can bring (and maintain) R c to a value less than unity will lead to the effective control (or elimination) of COVID 19 in the community. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID 19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on baseline levels of interventions) are 105, 100 for New York state and 164, 000 for the entire US by the end of the pandemic. These numbers dramatically decreased by 80% and 64%, respectively, if adherence to strict social distancing measures is improved and maintained until the end of May or June. The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social distancing measures are crucially important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID 19 pandemic. This study shows that early termination of the strict social distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social distance measures were implemented. The use of efficacious face masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy ≥ 70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID 19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti COVID 19 intervention strategies	0

We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability.

The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability.

743	"The COVID 19 crisis represents the most dangerous threat to public health since the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 1918. So far, the disease due to the SARS CoV 2 virus has been countered with extreme measures at national level that attempt to suppress epidemic growth. However, these approaches require quick adoption and enforcement in order to effectively curb virus spread, and may cause unprecedented socio economic impact. A viable alternative to mass surveillance and rule enforcement is harnessing collective intelligence by means of citizen empowerment. Mobile applications running on personal devices could significantly support this kind of approach by exploiting context/location awareness and data collection capabilities. In particular, technology assisted location and contact tracing, if broadly adopted, may help limit the spread of infectious diseases by raising end user awareness and enabling the adoption of selective quarantine measures. In this paper, we outline general requirements and design principles of personal applications for epidemic containment running on common smartphones, and we present a tool, called ""diAry"" or ""digital Ariadne"", based on voluntary location and Bluetooth tracking on personal devices, supporting a distributed query system that enables fully anonymous, privacy preserving contact tracing. We look forward to comments, feedback, and further discussion regarding contact tracing solutions for pandemic containment."	0
744	"Drug development is one of the most significant processes in the pharmaceutical industry. Various computational methods have dramatically reduced the time and cost of drug discovery. In this review, we firstly discussed roles of multiscale biomolecular simulations in identifying drug binding sites on the target macromolecule and elucidating drug action mechanisms. Then, virtual screening methods (e.g., molecular docking, pharmacophore modeling, and QSAR) as well as structure and ligand based classical/de novo drug design were introduced and discussed. Last, we explored the development of machine learning methods and their applications in aforementioned computational methods to speed up the drug discovery process. Also, several application examples of combining various methods was discussed. A combination of different methods to jointly solve the tough problem at different scales and dimensions will be an inevitable trend in drug screening and design. Molecules 2020, 25, 1375 2 of 17
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2013 was awarded jointly to Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt, and Arieh Warshel for their pioneering contributions in the development of multiscale models for complex biochemical systems, recognizing the important role that theory and computational methods play as a direct and necessary complement to experiments [12] . Further, applications of biomolecular simulations in identifying drug binding sites and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of diseases have been subject to rapid developments [13] [14] [15] .
Depending on the biological problems to be studied, multiscale models will be used in biomolecular simulations. The combination of quantum mechanics (QM) and molecular mechanics (MM) (QM/MM) can be used to study the electronic properties [16], simulate chemical reactions (e.g., the enzyme catalysis mechanism [17]), and calculate spectra [18] in a single simulation, which can be used to elucidate the action mechanism of certain drugs. Another widely used biomolecular method is molecular dynamics (MD) simulation [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , which applies empirical molecular mechanics (MM) force fields and is based on classical Newtonian mechanics. According to different accuracy requirements, all atom (AA), united atom (UA), and coarse grained (CG) MD simulations as well as explicit/implicit solvent models, which allow simulations of temporal and spatial scales, can be used to facilitate the drug discovery [25, 26] . Generally, MD simulations have been used for the identification of potential drug binding sites on target proteins, the calculation of binding free energy between target proteins and drug molecules, the action mechanism of drug molecules, etc. [27, 28] . However, it is worth mentioning that MD simulations are also limited to time and length scales. Currently, AAMD simulations can explore time dependent phenomena of large systems such as viral capsids in atomic detail as long as microseconds or even milliseconds [21, 29, 30] . Therefore, different types of simulation methods are required for different types of problems. Each of the different simulation methods has advantages, disadvantages, and practical limitations in terms of the size of system that can be simulated, the length of simulation that can be achieved, and the types of phenomena that can be modeled. On the other hand, improved algorithms, fast growing data sets and computing ability are driving rapid advances in multiscale modeling methods which provide a powerful emerging paradigm for drug discovery.
As mentioned above, multiscale biomolecular simulations are useful in drug design. For example, MD simulations can be used to identify the drug binding sites on the target protein as several simple tools (e.g., fpocket [31]). Moreover, multiscale biomolecular simulations can be used to reveal the action mechanism of a drug, which happens mainly on a molecular level, but clearly has macroscopic effects [32 34]. From the molecular structure level to cellular tissue, the dynamics of drug targets and the surprising complexity of biological systems challenge our scientific understanding. In order to reveal how changes at different levels are linked and interaction network, no single simulation method can solve all these problems involved. Multiscale simulation methods are designed to simulate and analyze cross scale connections, for example, how one scale change leads to another scale change. An obvious challenge is the integration of data and simulation across length scales and time scales. The current multiscale approach has potential to overcome these limitations by directly combining different levels of descriptions, thus bringing new prospects for drug discovery.
Multiscale simulations play an important role in studying biological processes. Here, we show applications of a combination of different methods to deal with complicated biological processes in this field. In recent years, although MD simulations are widely used, they still cannot consider the change of ionization states in simulated process. For example, MD simulations cannot discuss time dependence in a long time scale of biological proton transport process, so the time dependence of protein changes with pH also cannot be revealed [35] . Therefore, in calculations and simulation process, it is necessary to combine the Monte Carlo (MC) approach (performed time dependent simulations) in the proton transport process with the MD approach (performed pH dependent) in a protein model [35] . According to the electrostatic energy of the CG model, which can obtain the free energy of protonation states. In addition, the movement of the MC approach is based on the electrostatic energy of the CG model, and then proton transport time is used to make the scale, so as to correspond to the rate constant"	0

Objective: This review aims to provide an overview of various cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID 19 through three case reports and a literature review.
Results: Eighteen articles and three additional cases reported in this paper were included in this review. Of these studies, 6 are case series and 12 are case report studies. The most common cutaneous manifestation of COVID 19 was found to be maculopapular exanthem (morbilliform), presenting in 36.1% (26/72) patients. The other cutaneous manifestations included: a papulovesicular rash (34.7%, 25/72), urticaria (9.7%, 7/72), painful acral red purple papules (15.3%, 11/72) of patients, livedo reticularis lesions (2.8%, 2/72) and petechiae (1.4%, 1/72). Majority of lesions were localized on the trunk (66.7%, 50/72), however, 19.4% (14/72) of patients experienced cutaneous manifestations in the hands and feet. Skin lesion development occurred after the onset of respiratory symptoms or before J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 3 of 15 COVID 19 diagnosis in 12.5% (9/72) of the patients, and lesions spontaneously healed in all patients within 10 days. Majority of the studies reported no correlation between COVID 19 severity and skin lesions. Conclusion: Infection with COVID 19 may result in dermatological manifestations with various clinical presentations, which may aid in the timely diagnosis of this infection."	0
750	Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71 7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019 nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019 nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.	0

ABSTRACT The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on December 2019 about a coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province (China). Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID 19. More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID 19. Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database.
The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants' clinical conditions; and utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 (2019 nCoV). It is essential to emphasize that this article only captured trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database. We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM).
Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution."	0
754	"Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is an escalating global epidemic caused by SARS CoV 2, with a high mortality in critical patients. Effective indicators for predicting disease severity in SARS CoV 2 infected patients are urgently needed. Methods: In this study, 43 COVID 19 patients admitted in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center were involved. Demographic data, clinical features, and laboratory examinations were obtained through electronic medical records. Peripheral blood specimens were collected from COVID 19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profiles by flow cytometry. Potential contributing factors for prediction of disease severity were further analyzed.
Results: A total of 43 COVID 19 patients were included in this study, including 29 mild patients and 14 sever patients. Severe patients were significantly older (61.9±9.4 vs 44.4±15.9) and had higher incidence in co infection with bacteria compared to mild group (85.7%vs27.6%).
Significantly more severe patients had the clinical symptoms of anhelation (78.6%) and asthma (71.4%). For laboratory examination, 57.1% severe cases showed significant reduction in lymphocyte count.
The levels of Interluekin 6 (IL6), IL10, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and D Dimer (D D) were significantly higher in severe patients than mild patients, while the level of albumin (ALB) was remarkably All rights reserved.

Further analysis demonstrated that ESR, D D, age, ALB and IL6 were the major contributing factors for distinguishing severe patients from mild patients. Moreover, ESR was identified as the most powerful factor to predict disease progression of COVID 19 patients.
: Age and the levels of ESR, D D, ALB and IL6 are closely related to the disease severity of COVID 19 patients. ESR can be used as a valuable indicator for distinguishing severe COVID 19 patients in early stage, so as to increase the survival of severe patients."	0

representing a global share of 5.1% and 28.9% for incidence and mortality, respectively. In Italy, we report the analysis of the Italian Medical Council on 909 patients who died from COVID 19, of whom 16.5% were cancer patients. The population was enriched with subjects with multiple co morbid non communicable diseases, with less than 1% of the population presenting no comorbid conditions. At the patient level, we identified nine patients referred to our department in the last two months who were receiving standard of care or experimental medications in the curative and palliative settings. The median age was 68 years (range: 42 79 years), and patients carried a median of one co morbid condition (0 2); two out of nine patients presented with severe COVID 19 presentation, and were receiving inpatient care. None of the patients receiving immunotherapy experienced severe adverse outcomes, and four patients were discharged with complete reversal of the clinical syndrome and SARS CoV 2 clearance. Learning from the experience of countries with a high burden, efforts must be made to assure the access of cancer patients to treatments, prioritizing the cancer health interventions based on their intrinsic value, and limiting the exposure to an unacceptable risk of infection for both health providers and patients. Any significant work in the design and implementation of health system actions, including in clinical care, must be framed as an initiative under the Global Response Agenda and through a community approach, with the intention of pursuing common goals to Health's."	0
758	The pandemic novel coronavirus infection, Coronavirus Disease 2019 , has affected at least 190 countries or territories, with 465,915 confirmed cases and 21,031 deaths. In a containment based strategy, rapid, sensitive and specific testing is important in epidemiological control and clinical management. Using 96 SARS CoV 2 and 104 non SARS CoV 2 coronavirus genomes and our in house program, GolayMetaMiner, four specific regions longer than 50 nucleotides in the SARS CoV 2 genome were identified. Primers were designed to target the longest and previously untargeted nsp2 region and optimized as a probe free real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) assay. The new COVID 19 nsp2 assay had a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.8 TCID 50 /mL and did not amplify other human pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory viruses.

761	"As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) spreads across the world, the intensive care unit (ICU) community must prepare for the challenges associated with this pandemic. Streamlining of workflows for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention will matter not only to patients with COVID 19, but also to health care workers and other patients who are at risk from nosocomial transmission. Management of acute respiratory failure and haemodynamics is key. ICU practitioners, hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity, with a focus not just on infrastructure and supplies, but also on staff management. Critical care triage to allow the rationing of scarce ICU resources might be needed. Researchers must address unanswered questions, including the role of repurposed and experimental therapies. Collaboration at the local, regional, national, and international level offers the best chance of survival for the critically ill.

762	The findings of the Guttmacher–Lancet Commission on SRHR show that high income countries have largely instituted policies that favour holistic implementation of SRHR programmes and services, whereas most LMICs are battling with the reality of prioritising SRHR or are simply offering lip service to it. In this time of global pandemic of Covid 19 and the new demand placed on the system to cope with the resulting new demands, Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights has emphasized in its statement that there are concerns regarding increased wait times to access SRHR services, difficulties in accessing SRHR medications (including contraceptives, hormone therapy and HIV treatment and increased health risks), and increased health risks experienced by pregnant and immune compromised people.	0
763	We consider the control of the COVID 19 pandemic, modeled by a standard SIR compartmental model. The control of the epidemic is induced by the aggregation of individuals' decisions to limit their social interactions: on one side, when the epidemic is ongoing, an individual is encouraged to diminish his/her contact rate in order to avoid getting infected, but, on the other side, this effort comes at a social cost. If each individual lowers his/her contact rate, the epidemic vanishes faster but the effort cost may be high. A Mean Field Nash equilibrium at the population level is formed, resulting in a lower effective transmission rate of the virus. However, it is not clear that the individual's interest aligns with that of the society. We prove that the equilibrium exists and compute it numerically. The equilibrium selects a sub optimal solution in comparison to the societal optimum (a centralized decision respected fully by all individuals), meaning that the cost of anarchy is strictly positive. We provide numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis. We show that the divergence between the individual and societal strategies underway.	0

Then, we compute percentage changes of these metrics from a baseline based on the historical part of the anonymized metrics. We then discard a subset which does not meet our bar for statistical reliability, and release the rest publicly in a format that compares the result to the private baseline."	0

775	Small and medium sized tourism and hospitality enterprises (SMTHEs) are often susceptible to various hazards, which result in risk concerns. Insurance is recognised as one of the risk management strategies, but evidence indicates that insurance uptake among SMTHEs has been low. Yet, researchers have hardly researched into the factors that influence insurance uptake among SMTHEs. Two hundred and fifty (250) respondents were selected using a multi stage sampling technique. Confirmatory factor analysis, multivariate logit and probit regression techniques were used to determine factors underlying SMTHEs' insurance uptake. Risk concerns, the firm's characteristics, the perceived benefits of insurance and other informal risk coping mechanisms, as well as insurance service provision concerns were identified as determinants of insurance uptake. This is one of the first papers to offer a holistic understanding of the factors influencing SMTHEs' insurance subscription in a resourcescarce destination of Sub Saharan Africa. The practical and theoretical implications of the paper are discussed.	0

777	This short note provides estimates of the number of passengers that travel from China to all world airports in the period October 2019  March 2020 on the basis of historical data. From this baseline we subtract the expected reduction in the number of passengers taking into account the temporary ban of some routes which was put in place since 23 January 2020 following the COVID 2019 Coronavirus outbreak. The results indicate a reduction of the number of passengers in the period January  March 2020 of  2.5%. This calculation considers only the complete closure of routes (not just direct flights) and not the reduction in the number of passengers on still active direct and indirect connections. At the moment of writing, with such partial information it is premature to quantify economic losses on the civil air transport and tourism industry. This note is meant to provide a baseline that be extended to all countries of origin and updated as more recent data will become available.	0

784	Since the end of 2019 an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, called SARS CoV 2, is reported from China and later other parts of the world. Since January 21, WHO reports daily data on confirmed cases and deaths from both China and other countries [1]. The Johns Hopkins University [5] collects those data from various sources worldwide on a daily basis. For Germany, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) also issues daily reports on the current number of infections and infection related fatal cases [2]. However, due to delays in the data collection, the data from RKI always lags behind those reported by Johns Hopkins. In this work we present an extended SEIR model to describe the disease dynamics in Germany.

Design: Systematic review and meta analysis of the literature. Data sources: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus and PsycINFO were searched using the strategy: (Coronavirus OR Coronavirus Infections OR COVID OR SARS virus OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome OR MERS OR Middle east respiratory syndrome) AND (Follow up OR Follow up studies OR Prevalence). Original studies reporting the clinical outcomes of adult survivors of coronavirus outbreaks two months after discharge or three months after admission were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2009 Level of Evidence Tool. Meta analysis was conducted to derive pooled estimates of prevalence and severity for different outcomes at time points up to 6 months follow up and beyond 6 months follow up. Results: The search yielded 1169 studies of which 28 were included in this review. There were 15 Level 1b, 8 Level 2b, 2 Level 3b and 3 Level 4 studies by OCEBM grading. Pooled analysis of studies revealed that complications commonly observed were impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)

788	On March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID 19 a global pandemic. The infection, transmitted by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCov), was first discovered in December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then rapidly spread worldwide. Italy was early and severely involved, with a critical spread of the infection and a very high number of victims. Person to person spread mainly occurs via respiratory droplets and contact. The median incubation period is 5 days. The spectrum of respiratory symptoms may range from mild to severe, strictly depending on the age of the patient and the underlying comorbidities. In children COVID 19 related disease is less frequent and less aggressive. In Italy 1% of positive cases are under 18 years of age, and no deaths have been recorded before 29 years of age. For patients affected by rheumatic disease, despite the concerns related to the imbalance of their immune response and the effect of immunosuppressive treatments, there are still few data to understand the real consequences of this infection. Major scientific societies have issued recommendations to help rheumatologists in caring their patients. Interestingly, some of the drugs mostly used by rheumatologists appear to be promising in critical COVID 19 infected patients, where the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm seem to drive to the multiorgan failure. Pediatric rheumatologists are expected to play a supporting role in this new front of COVID 19 pandemic, both as general pediatricians treating infected children, and as rheumatologists taking care of their rheumatic patients, as well	1
789	"The COVID 19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has become a serious challenge for health systems worldwide. Despite the favorable clinical course for most cases, a mortality rate of 30 70% is expected for COVID 19 patients treated on intensive care unit (ICU) [1] . Reports have shown an increased risk of death for older patients with existing comorbidities and potential biomarkers associated with severity for COVID 19 patients [2, 3] .
Because of the complexity and the limited evidence on the pathogenesis of COVID 19, the management of critically ill patients has been challenging. Multiple recent studies have provided valuable clinical and laboratory features of hospitalized patients with COVID 19, but in many of them the information is not complete and there is a potential for overlapping data. Therefore, findings from a comprehensive systematic review can help physicians to understand the disease and make decisions for critically ill patients. In this study, we performed a quantitative evidence synthesis of clinical and laboratory factors associated with mortality in patients with COVID 19.
We searched the peer reviewed (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase) and gray (Google Scholar, bioRxiv, medRxiv) literature to identify studies comparing clinical data, laboratory parameters (hematological, biochemical, inflammatory markers, coagulation factors, and blood gas analysis) and complications between non survivors and survivors of COVID 19. We included only studies providing clinical data and at least one of the laboratory parameters previously mentioned. We excluded publications with potential overlapping reports, and studies from which data extraction was not possible. In case of potential overlapping data, we selected the study with most complete information.
Reports were screened in two stages: screening of titles and abstracts followed by the retrieval and screening of full text articles. Searches were performed from January 1, 2020 up to April 06, 2020, without language restrictions. The reference lists of all eligible studies and reviews were also evaluated to identify additional studies for inclusion. The following search terms were used: ""COVID 19″, ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2″, ""SARS CoV 2″, ""2019 nCoV"", ""coronavirus"" and ""coronaviruses"".
Data from publications were extracted by two authors and crosschecked for accuracy. Our outcome of interest was in hospital death. Clinical data, laboratory parameters, and complications were considered predictor variables. Effect sizes were reported as mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous variables and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous variables with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Not all studies reported data on all predictor variables, and the pooled analysis was estimated from the data available for each variable. A random effects model was used to pool the results and a 2 tailed p 〈 0.05 was used to determine significance. Cohen's classification was used to interpret the magnitude of the effect size for the laboratory findings. SMD 〉 0.8 was considered a large effect https://doi."	0
790	Background: Due to the influence of several factors on the hunting of game meat, we investigated how the seasonality of the environment, the abundance, and the biomass of wild animals, as well as the proximity to these resources, can affect the hunting. Methods: The research was developed with the Fulni ô people in the municipality of Águas Belas, Agreste of Pernambuco, Northeast of Brazil. In order to do this, we applied snowball sampling to select the participants. Data from potentially useful game species were obtained from lists and semi structured interviews to register their particular kind of uses, capture periods (daytime, night, or both), preferences, and perceived abundance. The hunters who allowed their game meat captured to be weighed and identified were followed for 1 year. Results: Our records pointed to a vast repertoire of potentially hunting animals. However, we did not verify relationships between the abundance, seasonality, and biomass of the animals that were hunted by the Fulni ô. We observed a total of 209,866 (kg) of game meat hunted in the studied group, belonging to 23 species, distributed in three taxonomic groups, the birds being the most representative group with 59% of total reported. Conclusion: Such consumption by the group is well below in terms of biomass when compared to other ethnic or local groups in other regions of Brazil, or in Caatinga areas, characterizing an activity much more of cultural character than subsistence. Also, the use of game meat among the Fulni ô seems to be actively directed to the preferred species, suggesting that in the case of an urbanized indigenous community, where other sources of income are available, the demand for game meat is lower when compared to other ethnic groups.	0
791	"The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 in Japan was reported on 15 January 2020 and the number of reported cases has increased day by day. The purpose of this study is to give a prediction of the epidemic peak for COVID 19 in Japan by using the real time data from 15 January to 29 February 2020. Taking into account the uncertainty due to the incomplete identification of infective population, we apply the well known SEIR compartmental model for the prediction. By using a least square based method with Poisson noise, we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in Japan is R 0 = 2.6 (95%CI, 2.4 2.8) and the epidemic peak could possibly reach the early middle summer. In addition, we obtain the following epidemiological insights: (1) the essential epidemic size is less likely to be affected by the rate of identification of the actual infective population;
(2) the intervention relatively long period is needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic size."	0

793	The sudden spread of Covid 19 outside China has pushed on March 11 the World Health Organization to acknowledge the ongoing outbreak as a pandemic. It is crucial in this phase to understand what should countries which presently lag behind in the spread of the infection learn from countries where the infection spread earlier. The choice of this work is to prefer timeliness to comprehensiveness. By adopting a purely empirical approach, we will limit ourselves to identifying different phases in the plots of different countries, based on their different functional behaviour, and to make a comparative analysis. The comparative analysis of the registered cases curves highlights remarkable similarities, especially among Western countries, together with some minor but crucial differences. We highlight how timeliness can largely reduce the size of the individual national outbreaks, ultimately limiting the final death toll. Our data suggest that Western governments have not unfortunately shown the capability to anticipate their decisions, based on the experience	1

We found genomic and evolutionary evidences of the 3 occurrence of 2019 nCoV like coronavirus (named as Pangolin CoV) from dead Malayan 4 Pangolins. Pangolin CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical at the whole genome level to 5 2019 nCoV and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively. Pangolin CoV is the lowest common 6 ancestor of 2019 nCoV and RaTG13. The S1 protein of Pangolin CoV is much more 7 closely related to 2019 nCoV than RaTG13. Five key amino acid residues involved in the 8 interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin CoV and 2019 9 nCoV but four amino acid mutations occur in RaTG13. It indicates Pangolin CoV has 10 similar pathogenic potential to 2019 nCoV, and would be helpful nCoV.	0

J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 2 Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) was first reported in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in other countries in December 2019. The infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, sometimes with digestive and other systemic manifestations, and some progressed with a severe acute respiratory syndrome or even death. Associated digestive symptoms were frequently observed in the patients, with an unknown significance and mechanism. ACE2, as the major known functional receptor of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) attracted our attention. We collected the clinical data of the 2019 nCoV infected patients from published studies and extracted the data about the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, we used online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs, especially in the small intestine, to explore the relationship between ACE2 expression patterns and clinical symptoms. We found that diarrhea accounted for a notable proportion of COVID 19 patients, ranging from 8.0% to 12.9%. The results reveal that ACE2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the small intestinal enterocytes but not in the goblet cells or intestinal immune cells. High expression of ACE2 on the surface cells in the digestive tract may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation susceptibility. Overall, digestive symptoms were common in the COVID 19 patients. ACE2 expression on surface cells of the small intestine may mediate the invasion and amplification of the virus and activation of gastrointestinal inflammation. It is a possible mechanism of digestive symptoms in the COVID 19 patients and explains the presence of the virus in patients' stool samples. The study also highlights the necessity of taking stool samples for suspected patients to help in early diagnosis and assessment of disease status."	0

799	Recently, researchers, specialists, and companies around the world are rolling out deep learning and image processing based systems that can fastly process hundreds of X Ray and computed tomography (CT) images to accelerate the diagnosis of pneumonia such as SARS, COVID 19, and aid in its containment. Medical images analysis is one of the most promising research areas, it provides facilities for diagnosis and making decisions of a number of diseases such as MERS, COVID 19. In this paper, we present a comparison of recent Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architectures for automatic binary classification of pneumonia images based fined tuned versions of (VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet201, Inception_ResNet_V2, Inception_V3, Resnet50, MobileNet_V2 and Xception). The proposed work has been tested using chest X Ray & CT dataset which contains 5856 images (4273 pneumonia and 1583 normal). As result we can conclude that finetuned version of Resnet50, MobileNet_V2 and Inception_Resnet_V2 show highly satisfactory performance with rate of increase in training and validation accuracy (more than 96% of accuracy). Unlike CNN, Xception, VGG16, VGG19, Inception_V3 and DenseNet201 display low performance (more than 84% accuracy).	0

Crystal structure of the catalytic domain of Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase in complex with a non carbohydrate based inhibitor, 2 (cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid a b s t r a c t Anti bacterial and anti viral neuraminidase agents inhibit neuraminidase activity catalyzing the hydrolysis of terminal N acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) from glycoconjugates and help to prevent the host pathogenesis that lead to fatal infectious diseases including influenza, bacteremia, sepsis, and cholera. Emerging antibiotic and drug resistances to commonly used anti neuraminidase agents such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) have highlighted the need to develop new anti neuraminidase drugs. We obtained a serendipitous complex crystal of the catalytic domain of Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase (CpNanI CD ) with 2 (cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid (CHES) as a buffer. Here, we report the crystal structure of CpNanI CD in complex with CHES at 1.24 Å resolution. Amphipathic CHES binds to the catalytic site of CpNanI CD similar to the substrate (Neu5Ac) binding site. The 2aminoethanesulfonic acid moiety and cyclohexyl groups of CHES interact with the cluster of three arginine residues and with the hydrophobic pocket of the CpNanI CD catalytic site. In addition, a structural comparison with other bacterial and human neuraminidases suggests that CHES could serve as a scaffold for the development of new anti neuraminidase agents targeting CpNanI."	0
801	Chest X ray (CXR) is the most common test among medical imaging modalities. It is applied for detection and differentiation of, among others, lung cancer, tuberculosis, and pneumonia, the last with importance due to the COVID 19 disease. Integrating computer aided detection methods into the radiologist diagnostic pipeline, greatly reduces the doctors' workload, increasing reliability and quantitative analysis. Here we present a novel deep learning approach for lung segmentation, a basic, but arduous task in the diagnostic pipeline. Our method uses state of the art fully convolutional neural networks in conjunction with an adversarial critic model. It generalized well to CXR images of unseen datasets with different patient profiles, achieving a final DSC of 97.5% on the JSRT dataset.	0

804	Background There is variability among clinicians in their ability to detect murmurs during cardiac auscultation and identify the underlying pathology. Deep learning approaches have shown promise in medicine by transforming collected data into clinically significant information. Objective The objective of this research is to assess the performance of a deep learning algorithm to detect murmurs and clinically significant valvular heart disease using recordings from a commercial digital stethoscope platform. Methods Using over 34 hours of previously acquired and annotated heart sound recordings, we trained a deep neural network to detect murmurs. To test the algorithm, we enrolled 373 patients in a clinical study and collected recordings at the four primary auscultation locations. Ground truth was established using patient echocardiograms and annotations by three expert cardiologists. Results Algorithm performance for detecting murmurs has sensitivity and specificity of 76.3% and 91.4%, respectively. By omitting softer murmurs, those with grade 1, sensitivity increases to 90.0%. The algorithm detects moderate to severe or greater aortic stenosis with sensitivity of 97.5% and specificity of 77.7% and detects moderate to severe or greater mitral regurgitation with sensitivity of 64.0% and specificity of 90.5%. Conclusion The deep learning algorithm's ability to detect murmurs and clinically significant aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation is comparable to expert cardiologists. The research findings attest to the reliability and utility of such algorithms as front line clinical support tools to aid clinicians in screening for cardiac murmurs caused by valvular heart disease.

806	"Coronavirus COVID 19 spreads through the population mostly based on social contact. To gauge the potential for widespread contagion, to cope with associated uncertainty and to inform its mitigation, more accurate and robust modelling is centrally important for policy making.
We provide a flexible modelling approach that increases the accuracy with which insights can be made. We use this to analyse different scenarios relevant to the COVID 19 situation in the UK. We present a stochastic model that captures the inherently probabilistic nature of contagion between population members. The computational nature of our model means that spatial constraints (e.g., communities and regions), the susceptibility of different age groups and other factors such as medical pre histories can be incorporated with ease. We analyse different possible scenarios of the COVID 19 situation in the UK. Our model is robust to small changes in the parameters and is flexible in being able to deal with different scenarios.
This approach goes beyond the convention of representing the spread of an epidemic through a fixed cycle of susceptibility, infection and recovery (SIR). It is important to emphasise that standard SIR type models, unlike our model, are not flexible enough and are also not stochastic and hence should be used with extreme caution. Our model allows both heterogeneity and inherent uncertainty to be incorporated. Due to the scarcity of verified data, we draw insights by calibrating our model using parameters from other relevant sources, including agreement on average (mean field) with parameters in SIR based models. We use the model to assess parameter sensitivity for a number of key variables that characterise the COVID 19 epidemic. We also test several control parameters with respect to their influence on the severity of the outbreak. Our analysis shows that due to inclusion of spatial heterogeneity in the population and the asynchronous timing of the epidemic across different areas, the severity of the epidemic might be lower than expected from other models.
We find that one of the most crucial control parameters that may significantly reduce the severity of the epidemic is the degree of separation of vulnerable people and people aged 70 years and over, but note also that isolation of other groups has an effect on the severity of the epidemic. It is important to remember that models are there to advise and not to replace reality, and that any action should be coordinated and approved by public health experts with experience in dealing with epidemics.
The computational approach makes it possible for further extensive scenario based analysis to be undertaken. This and a comprehensive study of sensitivity of the model to different parameters defining COVID 19 and its development will be the subject of our forthcoming paper. In that paper, we shall also extend the model where we will consider different probabilistic scenarios for infected people with mild and severe cases."	0
807	"Background: The international community has been put in an unprecedented situation by the COVID 19 pandemic. Creating models to describe and quantify alternative mitigation strategies becomes increasingly urgent.
Methods: In this study, we propose an agent based model of disease transmission in a society divided into closely connected families, workplaces, and social groups. This allows us to discuss mitigation strategies, including targeted quarantine measures.
Results: We find that workplace and more diffuse social contacts are roughly equally important to disease spread, and that an effective lockdown must target both. We examine the cost benefit of replacing a lockdown with tracing and quarantining contacts of the infected. Quarantine can contribute substantially to mitigation, even if it has short duration and is done within households. When reopening society, testing and quarantining is a strategy that is much cheaper in terms of lost workdays than a long lockdown of workplaces.
Conclusions: A targeted quarantine strategy is quite efficient with only 5 days of quarantine, and its relative effect increases when supplemented with other measures that reduce disease transmission.

808	"Chinese government has taken strong measures in response to the epidemic of new coronavirus (2019 nCoV) from Jan.23, 2020. The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data.
Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed identified Recovered (EIR) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase. Then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions. According to the spread characters of 2019 nCov, we construct a novel EIR compartment system dynamics model. This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. We assume that 2019 nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. Use the latest reported data from National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019 nCov. Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019 nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated. The epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared.
In our baseline scenario, the government has taken strict prevention actions, and the estimate numbers fit the official numbers very well. Simulation results tells that, if the prevention measures are relaxed or the action starting date of prevention measures is later than Jan. 23, 2020, the peak of identified individuals would be greatly increased, and the elimination date also would be delayed. We estimate the reproductive number for 2019 nCoV was 2.7. And simulation of the baseline scenario tells that, the peak infected individuals will be 49093 at Feb.16, 2020 and the epidemic spreading will be eliminated at the end of March 2020. The simulation results also tell that the quarantine rate and the starting date of intervention action policy have great effect on the epidemic spreading. Specifically, if the quarantine rate is reduced from 100% to less than 63%, which is the threshold of the quarantine rate to control the epidemic .

809	"virus has caused a casualty of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 cases are serious. Mainly based on Chinese newspapers, social media and other digital platform data, this paper analyzes the timeline of the key actions taken by the government and people over three months in five different phases. It found that although there was an initial delay in responding, a unique combination of strong governance, strict regulation, strong community vigilance and citizen participation, and wise use of big data and digital technologies, were some of the key factors in China's efforts to combat this virus. Being inviable and non measurable (unlike radioactive exposure), appropriate and timely information is very important to form the basic foundation of mitigation and curative measures. Infodemic, as it is termed by WHO, is a key word, where different stakeholder's participation, along with stricter regulation, is required to reduce the impact of fake news in this information age and social media. Although different countries will need different approaches, focusing on its humanitarian nature and addressing infodemic issues are the two critical factors for future global mitigation efforts.
was to share customized information with specific target groups [2] . Finally, on 11th March, WHO declared it this as a pandemic.
""We know that every outbreak will be accompanied by a kind of tsunami of information, but also within this information you always have misinformation, rumors, etc. We know that even in the Middle Ages there was this phenomenon. ""But the difference now with social media is that this phenomenon is amplified, it goes faster and further, like the viruses that travel with people and go faster and further. So it is a new challenge, and the challenge is the [timing] because you need to be faster if you want to fill the void...What is at stake during an outbreak is making sure people will do the right thing to control the disease or to mitigate its impact. So it is not only information to make sure people are informed; it is also making sure people are informed to act appropriately."" Said Sylvie Briand, Director of Infectious Hazards Management at WHO's Health Emergencies Program and architect of WHO's strategy to counter the infodemic risk. This poses the real challenge of mitigating the risk occurring from Coronavirus.
One of the key issues of the ""invisible disaster"" is obtaining correct information. In 2011, Japan had a triple disaster, caused by an earthquake induced tsunami, which caused a nuclear meltdown. A that time, there was a severe panic in and around Japan about the level of radiation, which was also an invisible disaster. However, radiation could be measured, whereas the level of penetration of the virus is not measurable. Therefore, providing the right information from a reliable source is the key issue in this type of pandemic.
Keeping this infodemic challenge in mind, this paper tries to analyze three months of happenings in China from December 2019 to February 2020, drawing and analyzing data from different Chinese websites, social media and research institutes. The value addition of this paper lies in the fact that original data were collected and analyzed in Chinese, and from Chinese social media. Although a characteristic information censorship exists in China, there were several positive and negative things that happened in the last three months. This paper is a narrative of those events and provides an original analysis.
There are three characteristics/impacts of the paper: (1) this is possibly the first analytical paper which uses firsthand social media and internet data and information from China to describe the time series narrative in Wuhan and China with a focus on key policy decision, (2) it also uses original survey raw data to understand the types of media people used to get information, and (3) the reliance of different types of online services at different phases of the lockdown.
Of course, the paper has its own limitation, since, due to the evolving nature of the pandemic, the paper analyzes the spread in the original hotspot (although, as of late March 2020, the hotspot has shifted to Europe), which was Wuhan and the Hubei province of China. However, the key findings, which are described in Section 5, are useful to other parts of the world, which is currently suffering the impacts of COVID 19, as well as in future pandemic responses.

One of the questions many governments are asking is how the spread is going to evolve in time. In this study, an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak was applied to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation. As some of the parameters were unknown, and the data for Portugal is still scarce, given that the outbreak started later (first case on the 2nd of March) I used Italian data (first reported case in Italy on the 31st of January) to predict them. I then construct five different scenarios for the evolution of covid 19 in Portugal, considering both the effectiveness of the mitigation measurements implemented by the government, and the selfprotective measures taken by the population, as explained in the South Korean model."	0
811	To date, the world perhaps has never waited for the summer so impatiently in the entire Anthropocene, owing to the debate whether increasing temperature and humidity will decrease the environmental endurance of SARS CoV 2. We present the perspective on the seasonal change on SARS CoV 2 decay and COVID 19 spread. Our arguments are based on: i) structural similarity of coronavirus with several enteric viruses, and its vulnerability; ii) reports related to decay of those similar transmissible gastroenteritis viruses (TGEV) like norovirus and iii) improvement in the human immunity during summer compared to winter. We present reasons why we can be optimistic about the slowdown of corona in the upcoming summer.	1

The term 'emerging infectious diseases' (EIDs) is a broad one that covers newly recognized human diseases caused by pathogens that have recently jumped species, older pathogens that have emerged in new populations due to human behaviors or modifications to natural habitats, and older pathogens that are exhibiting resurgence in areas once brought under control, usually due to microbiological adaptation and change; this includes previously identified microorganisms exhibiting new patterns of antimicrobial drug resistance and pathogenic properties. Emerging infectious diseases are those with increasing incidence at local, regional, or international scales, and are spreading from epicenters to new geographic areas. The surveillance, study and control of EIDs is a complex interdisciplinary effort, crossing international borders and involving the collaborative efforts of scientists, clinicians, and political leaders from many disciplines and backgrounds to protect human health.
According to a comprehensive literature review performed by Taylor et al. (2001) at the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, 1415 species of infectious organisms known to be pathogenic to humans were identified. The human pathogens tabulated by this study included an assortment of 217 viruses and prions, 538 bacteria and rickettsia, 307 fungi, 66 protozoa and 287 helminths. The majority of these (61%) were zoonotic infections transmitted from animals to humans. Of the 175 pathogenic species associated with diseases considered to be 'emerging', 135 (75%) were zoonotic. The study found that protozoan and virus pathogens were particularly likely to emerge, and that the helminths were less likely to do so. Interestingly, no association was found between route of transmission and emergence in this study. An updated literature survey from the Centre for Infectious Diseases at the same institution (University of Edinburgh) was published in 2005 by Woolhouse and Gowtage Sequeria. This study identified 1407 species of human pathogens, 58% of which were zoonotic. Of the total, 177 were regarded as 'emerging' or 're emerging' pathogens. The emerging and re emerging zoonotic pathogens were most likely to have the broadest host ranges. The authors noted that although zoonotic pathogens constitute a significant source for emerging and re EIDs, only a small minority of them would prove capable of causing major epidemics in the human population  but the H5N1 influenza strain could prove to be an exception.
Causal factors contributing to the emergence of new pathogens include human population growth resulting in human encroachment on wildlife habitats, increased human contact with domestic and wild animals, changes in agricultural practices CHAPTER 3 sECTion 1 ä PRE TRAvEl AdviCE"	0

819	The infection coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by a virus classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). At cellular level, virus infection initiates with binding of viral particles to the host surface cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS CoV 2 engages ACE2 as the entry receptor and employs the cellular serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming. TMPRSS2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host. Understanding how TMPRSS2 protein expression in the lung varies in the population could reveal important insights into differential susceptibility to influenza and coronavirus infections. Here, we systematically analyzed coding region variants in TMPRSS2 and the eQTL variants, which may affect the gene expression, to compare the genomic characteristics of TMPRSS2 among different populations. Our findings suggest that the lung specific eQTL variants may confer different susceptibility or response to SARS CoV 2 infection from different populations under the similar conditions. In particular, we found that the eQTL variant rs35074065 is associated with high expression of TMPRSS2 but with a low expression of the interferon (IFN) α/β inducible gene, MX1, splicing isoform. Thus, these subjects could account for a more susceptibility response.	0
820	"A key challenge for estimating the epidemiological parameters of the COVID 19 outbreak in Wuhan is the discrepancy between the officially reported number of infections and the true number of infections. A common approach to tackling the challenge is to use the number of infections exported from Wuhan to infer the true number in the city. This approach can only provide a static estimate of the epidemiological parameters before Wuhan lockdown on January 23, 2020, because there are almost no exported cases thereafter. Here, we propose a method to dynamically estimate the epidemiological parameters of the COVID 19 outbreak in Wuhan by recovering true numbers of infections from day to day official numbers. Using the method, we provide a comprehensive retrospection on how the disease had progressed in Wuhan from January 19 to March 5, 2020. Particularly, we estimate that the outbreak sizes by January 23 and March 5 were 11, 239 [95% CI 4,372] and 124,506 [95% CI 69,113], respectively. The effective reproduction number attained its maximum on January 24 (3.42 [95% CI 3.34 3.50]) and became less than 1 from February 7 (0.76 [95% CI 0.65 0.92]). We also estimate the effects of two major government interventions on the spread of COVID 19 in Wuhan. In particular, transportation suspension and large scale hospitalization respectively prevented 33,719 and 90,072 people from getting infected in the nine day time period right after its implementation.

824	"Since the emergence of SARS CoV 2 in December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 has rapidly spread across the globe. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that age is one of the strongest risk factors influencing the morbidity and mortality of COVID 19. Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age associated changes with experimental data on host interactions between SARS CoV 2 or its relative SARS CoV, we identify several age associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID 19 in older populations. We observed that age associated gene expression and cell populations are significantly linked to the heightened severity of COVID 19 in older populations.
The aging lung is characterized by increased vascular smooth muscle contraction, reduced mitochondrial activity, and decreased lipid metabolism. Lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts, pericytes and CD4  Tcm cells increase in abundance with age. Several age associated genes have functional effects on SARS CoV replication, and directly interact with the SARS CoV 2 proteome. Interestingly, ageassociated genes are heavily enriched among those induced or suppressed by SARS CoV 2 infection. These analyses illuminate potential avenues for further studies on the relationship between the aging lung and COVID disease."	0
825	Strict interventions were successful to control the novel coronavirus (COVID 19) outbreak in China. As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID 19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Children 0 14 years were 59% (95% CI 7 82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID 19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. These findings can help guide global intervention policies.	1

827	"COVID 19, caused by SARS CoV 2 infection, has recently been announced as a pandemic all over the world. Plenty of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic knowledges have been enriched from clinical studies since December 2019. However, animal models, particularly non human primate models, are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients, evaluations of anti viral drugs and vaccines. In this study, two families of non human primates, old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta, 6 Macaca fascicularis) and new world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were experimentally inoculated with SARS CoV 2. Clinical signs were recorded. Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS CoV 2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys. Viral shedding from upper respiratory reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C. jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung, heart and stomach of SARS CoV 2 infected animals. In summary, we have established a NHP model for COVID 19, which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines, and investigate viral pathogenesis. M. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS CoV2 infection, followed by M. fascicularis and C. jacchus. One Sentence Summary: M. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS CoV 2 infection as compared to M. fascicularis and C. jacchus. : bioRxiv preprint COVID 19 model, two families including 3 species of non human primates, which are widely used for animal models with their own advantages and disadvantages, were experimentally infected with SARS CoV 2, followed by comparisons of clinical symptoms, hematology, biochemical indexes, immunology and histopathology among 3 species. We found that both Macaca mulatta (M. mulatta) and Macaca fascicularis (M. fascicularis) of old world monkeys were susceptible to SARS CoV 2 infection, although M. mulatta was more susceptible to viral infection than M. fascicularis. However, : bioRxiv preprint SARS CoV 2 infection. Therefore, as the model of COVID 19, M. mulatta and M. fascicularis may be chosen for further exploration of viral pathogenesis, evaluation of anti SARS CoV 2 drugs and vaccines.
Given that host factors may be involved in viral pathogenesis, we designed an experiment in the present study to investigate whether host genetics, age and gender affect SARS CoV 2 infection in non human primates (Figure 1 ). Two families of non human primates, old world monkeys (12 M. mulatta, 6 M. fascicularis) and new world monkeys (6 C. jacchus), were chosen for this experiment after screening and randomly grouped based on species, age and gender ( Figure 1 ). Animals in large size (4 adults and 4 old M. mulatta, 6 M. fascicularis) were inoculated with 4.75x10 6 pfu of SARS CoV 2 via 3 routines (intratreachuslly 4.0ml, intranasally 0.5ml and intra 0.25ml). Half dosage of the viruses was given to 4 young M. mulatta via the same 3 routines. 6 C. jacchus were inoculated with 1.0x10 6 pfu intranasally.
Animals were monitored daily and sampled at the indicated time points before and after viral inoculation (Figure 1 ). Increased body temperature (BT) (above 38 ℃) was continuously observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS CoV 2. BT of 7/12 M. mulatta reached the first peak on day 4 6 post inoculation (dpi) and maintained above 38 ℃ for several days. The highest BT was 40.9 ℃ during SARS CoV 2 infection. Of M. fascicularis, their BT didn't change as much as those of M. mulatta. And duration of BT>38 ℃ in M. fascicularis was shorter than M. mulatta (Figure 2A ).
On 0 and 10 dpi, body weight (BW) of experimental animals (C. jacchus not determined) was checked on electronic balance. As compared to BW on day 0, nine out of 12 M. mulatta showed the decreased BW with declined range of 5.88% 28.57%. Eighty three percent (5/6) of M. fascicularis lost BW by 2."	0
828	Due to the recent coronavirus outbreak, many efforts and innovative solutions have surfaced to deal with the possible shortage of ventilators upon catastrophic surges of patients. One solution involves splitting one ventilator to treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are obvious risks and little is known on how the technique would work on patients with ARDS from Covid 19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs of equal characteristics can be successfully ventilated from one machine, but that large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with different compliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility of the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments expanding on the previous studies with different ventilator setting and lung characteristics. Using two test lungs connected to a ventilator, the tidal volumes and pressures into both lungs were measured for different combinations of lung compliance, airway resistances, modes of ventilation, inspiratory and end expiratory pressure levels. We found large discrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs with compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway resistances, and that higher PEEP settings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test lungs. The most balanced, although far from ideal, delivery of tidal volumes for the test lungs with different compliance was measured using pressure controlled ventilation with a maximum inspiratory pressure of 30 mbar and a PEEP at 6 or 10 mbar. From this study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to identify reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the hazards of the technique.	0

830	"Background: Following stringent social distancing measures, some European countries are beginning to report a slowed or negative rate of growth of daily case numbers testing positive for the novel coronavirus. The notion that the first wave of infection is close to its peak begs the question of whether future peaks or 'second waves' are likely. We sought to determine the current size of the effective (i.e. susceptible) population for seven European countries to estimate immunity levels following this first wave. We compare these numbers to the total population sizes of these countries, in order to investigate the potential for future peaks.
We used Bayesian model inversion to estimate epidemic parameters from the reported case and death rates from seven countries using data from late January 2020 to April 5 th 2020. Two distinct generative model types were employed: first a continuous time dynamical systems implementation of a Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model and second: a partially observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) or hidden Markov model (HMM) implementation of an SEIR model. Both models parameterise the size of the initial susceptible population ('S0'), as well as epidemic parameters.
Parameter estimation ('data fitting') was performed using a standard Bayesian scheme (variational Laplace) designed to allow for latent unobservable states and uncertainty in model parameters.
Results: Both models recapitulated the dynamics of transmissions and disease as given by case and death rates. The peaks of the current waves were predicted to be in the past for four countries (Italy, Spain, Germany and Switzerland) and to emerge in 0.5  2 weeks in Ireland and 1 3 weeks in the UK. For France one model estimated the peak within the past week and the other in the future in two weeks. Crucially, Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of S0 for each country indicated effective population sizes of below 20% (of total population size), under both the continuous time and HMM models. Using for all countries with a Bayesian weighted average across all seven countries and both models, we estimated that 6.4% of the total population would be immune. From the two models the maximum percentage of the effective population was estimated at 19.6% of the total population for the UK, 16.7% for Ireland, 11.4% for Italy, 12.8% for Spain, 18.8% for France, 4.7% for Germany and 12.9% for Switzerland.
Our results indicate that after the current wave, a large proportion of the total population will remain without immunity. This suggests that in the absence of strong seasonal effects, new medications or more comprehensive contact tracing, a further set of epidemic waves in different geographic centres are likely. These findings may have implications for 'exit strategies' from any lockdown stage."	0

The world is in the grip of pandemic . Children appear to be only mildly affected but for those countries that are still preparing for their first wave of infections, it is salutary to have some estimates with which to plan for eventual contingencies. These assessments would include acute hospital admission requirements, intensive care admissions and deaths per given population. It is also useful to have an estimate of how many paediatric admissions to expect per given population. However it is only very recently that paediatric epidemiological data has become available. This paper will create an interactive spreadsheet model to estimate population and paediatric admissions for a given population, with the author's country, Malta, as a worked example for both. Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f COVID 19 admissions calculators: general population and paediatric cohort. Paediatric populations Lu et. al. evaluated both symptomatic and asymptomatic children (<16 years) who were contacts with confirmed or suspected COVID19.(3) 1391 children were assessed with 171 (12.3%) confirmed cases. The median age was 6.7 years.

 12 had radiologic features of pneumonia in the absence of symptoms of infection.
 3 patients required intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation and these all had comorbidities (hydronephrosis, leukemia on maintenance chemotherapy, and intussusception.
 6 (3.5%) had lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1.2×10 9 /liter)  The most common radiological finding was bilateral ground glass opacity (32.7%). Dong et al. retrospectively evaluated 2,143 children (<18 years) who had confirmed infection or were presumed to have the disease based on symptoms and history of exposure.(4) Median age was 7 years. Levels of severity were defined thus:  4.4% were asymptomatic infections with normal chest imaging.
 50.9 % were mild with symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infection along with fever, fatigue, myalgia, cough, sore throat, runny nose, and sneezing. Physical examination  38.8 % were moderate with pneumonia but no obvious hypoxemia such as shortness of breath. Some of these had only radiological findings with no clinical manifestation.
 5.2% were severe with dyspnea and oxygen saturation <92%.
 0.6% were critical with respiratory failure/shock/encephalopathy/myocardial injury or heart failure/coagulopathyacute kidney injury.
Interestingly, vulnerability was inversely related to age in that the proportion of severe and critical cases were 10.6 %, 7.3%, 4.2%, 4.1% and 3.0% for the age groups of <1, 1 5, 6 10, 11 15 and ≥16 years.

Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f Discussion By the very nature of the disease and its definition, is not easy to control pandemic spread.
China has managed to drastically reduce new cases by more than 90%.(7) but this has taken draconian measure. Countries that started late have taken off exponentially, with hospitals overwhelmed.(7) Intensive care units have been completely inundated, with the chief bottleneck being availability of mechanical ventilators to tide critically ill patients over their intensive care stay.(7) For these reasons, global mortality may even greatly exceed that of so called Spanish Flu around the end of the First World War. (8,9) This paper will not discuss mitigation vs. suppression measures and the importance of hygiene etc, except to note that without active and very vigorous suppression, harrowing scenes will be re enacted, as we witnessed after surges of cases in Northern Italy, and over the last few days, in New York.(9) The non availability of ventilators to cope with extreme surges in case numbers may lead to triage situations with doctors having to choose who to ventilate and who to leave to die. (7) The results shown here suggest that the Maltese health services would find it extremely difficult to cope even with a 20% infection rate spread over a 14 week period. (10) These calculations assume that severe cases that would normally require relatively standard care (such as supplemental and non invasive administration of oxygen, intravenous fluids, antibiotics for secondary infections etc) actually manage to access these therapies. In surge conditions, even the provision of such relatively basic and standard care may falter or fail.
Furthermore, in extreme surge situations, the provision of care for everyday medical conditions would also be compromised, with morbidity and mortality also incurred from non novel conditions. Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f Conclusion It is hoped that these calculators will help clinicians and planners to plan ahead with the expected surges in cases in respective regions and countries."	0

837	"Traditional approaches to case finding, case isolation, and contact tracing methods have so far proved insufficient on their own to prevent the development of local epidemics of COVID 19 in many high income countries despite relatively advanced public health systems. As a result, many governments have resorted to widespread social distancing measures and mass quarantines ('lock downs') to reduce transmission and to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. However, such measures impose heavy human and societal costs. Automated or semi automated digital contact tracing, in conjunction with scaled up community testing, has been proposed as a key part of exit strategies from lockdowns. However, the effectiveness of these approaches to contact tracing is unclear, and to be effective, trusted, and widely adopted such technology must overcome several challenges.
We will perform a rapid systematic review to assess the effectiveness of automated and semiautomated digital tools for contact tracing, and identify key considerations for successful implementation, to inform the control of COVID 19. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Medical COVID information portal, OVID Global Health, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, BioRxiv, and arXiv for peer reviewed and pre print papers on automated or semi automated digital tools for contact tracing of COVID 19, another respiratory disease with pandemic potential (limited to SARS, MERS, or pandemic influenza), or Ebola, in human populations. Studies will be eligible if published in English between 1 January 2000 and 14 April 2020. We will synthesise study findings narratively and will consider meta analysis if ≥3 suitable studies with comparable interventions and outcomes are available.

838	"Homology between human and viral proteins is an established factor in viral or vaccine induced autoimmunity. Failure of SARS and MERS vaccines in animal trials involved pathogenesis consistent with an immunological priming that could involve autoimmunity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the SARS and MERS spike protein. Exposure pathogenesis to SARS CoV 2 in COVID 19 likely will lead to similar outcomes. Immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides (similar to the more diffuse idea of ""immune enhancement""). Here I provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure, via infection or injection. SAR CoV 2 spike proteins, and all other SARS CoV 2 proteins, immunogenic epitopes in each SARS CoV 2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching. Only one immunogenic epitope in a SARS CoV 2 had no homology to human proteins. If all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming, the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development. Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID 19 disease. It also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself, targeting elements of MHC Class I and Class II antigen presentation, PD 1 signaling, cross presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the ER Phagosome pathway. Translational consequences of these findings are explored."	0
839	Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) assays are used to test patients and key workers for infection with the causative SARS CoV 2 virus. RT PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives can occur if the sample contains insufficient quantities of the virus to be successfully amplified and detected. The amount of virus in a swab is likely to vary between patients, sample location (nasal, throat or sputum) and through time as infection progresses. Here, we analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT PCR tests and were identified as SARS CoV 2 positive at least once. We identify that the probability of a positive test decreases with time after symptom onset, with throat samples less likely to yield a positive result relative to nasal samples. Empirically derived distributions of the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation allowed us to comment on the likely false negative rates in cohorts of patients who present for testing at different clinical stages. We further estimate the expected numbers of false negative tests in a group of tested individuals and show how this is affected by the timing of the tests. Finally, we assessed the robustness of these estimates of false negative rates to the probability of false positive tests. This work has implications both for the identification of infected patients and for the discharge of convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious.	0
840	"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV, also known as SARS CoV 2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019 nCoV/SARS CoV 2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV host interactome and drug targets in the human protein protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019 nCoV/SARS CoV 2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019 nCoV/SARS CoV 2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug gene signatures and HCoV induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the ""Complementary Exposure"" pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019 nCoV/SARS CoV 2."	0

843	"21 Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are a valuable animal model used in biomedical research.
22 Ferrets undergo significant variation in body weight seasonally, affected by photoperiod, 23 and these variations make it difficult to use weight as an indicator of health status. To 24 overcome this requires a better understanding of these seasonal weight changes. We 25 provide a normative weight data set for the female ferret accounting for seasonal 26 changes, and also investigate the effect of fluid regulation on weight change. Female 27 ferrets (n=39) underwent behavioural testing from May 2017 to August 2019 and were 28 weighed daily while housed in an animal care facility with controlled light exposure. In the 29 winter (October to March), animals experienced 10 hours of light and 14 hours of dark, 30 while in summer (March to October), this contingency was reversed. Individual animals 31 varied in their body weight from approximately 700 to 1200 g. However, weights fluctuated 32 with light cycle, with animals losing weight in summer, and gaining weight in winter such 33 that they fluctuated between approximately 80% and 120% of their long term average 34 weight. Ferrets were weighed as part of their health assessment while experiencing water 35 regulation for behavioural training. Water regulation superimposed additional weight 36 changes on these seasonal fluctuations, with weight loss during the 5 day water 37 regulation period being greater in summer than winter. These data establish a normative 38 benchmark for seasonal weight variation in female ferrets that can be incorporated into : bioRxiv preprint 42 of biomedical research areas, including: neuroscience [1 6], drug development [7] and 43 respiratory diseases such as Influenza and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 44 [8,9] including the new coronavirus strain, SARS CoV 2 [10]. In laboratory animals 45 exposed to scientific procedures, a standard approach to monitoring health status is to 46 measure body weight. Weight loss is a key indicator of health problems, and therefore 47 understanding the factors that contribute to natural variation in body weight is critical for 48 correctly monitoring an animal's condition. Ferrets undergo significant variation in their 49 body weight seasonally; however, there is currently no normative data available to provide 50 a benchmark for the expected seasonal weight changes. Seasonal variations may mask 51 or exaggerate changes in body weight due to an experimental procedure or change in 52 health status and thus must be integrated into assessments of a ferret's health status. 53 Seasonal weight changes have been demonstrated in multiple species 54 independent of diurnality, including monkeys [11,12], raccoons [13], hamsters [14] and 55 rodents [15]. There are a range of potential factors that elicit seasonal weight changes, 56 but temperature and day length are key triggers, which are ultimately crucial for survival. 57 Ferrets are members of the mustelid family and have been domesticated from 58 European polecats, a species which was native to western Euroasia. Seasonal weight 59 changes have been observed in polecats and other closely related species such as mink. 60 These weight changes are seen as adaptations to the differing energy intake and 61 expenditure requirements of winter and summer [16,17]. In animal care facilities, daylight . 4 62 hours can be easily regulated and are often set at a 12 hour light cycle (12 hours ON, 12 63 hours OFF) or synchronised with the external environment; for example, varying from a 64 minimum 8 hour cycle in winter (8 hours ON, 16 hours OFF) to maximum 16 hour cycle 65 in summer (16 hours ON, 8 hours OFF) [18 21]. Variation in the photoperiod can change 66 factors such as eating habits, coat thickness, sleep and activity levels  all of which may 67 contribute to normal and possible abnormal weight changes. Previous research has 68 demonstrated that ferret weights increase as hours of daylight decrease, leading to 69 sinusoidal weight fluctuations with annual light cycle [22,23]. Contrastingly, in another 70 study where the sleep habits of two male ferrets were tracked, light/dark schedule was 71
shown to have no effect on their weight [24].
In addition to body weight, changes in photoperiod have also been linked to the 73 timing of the oestrus cycle, which occurs once per year in female ferrets [20,22,25,26].
74 One of the first studies showed that sexual activity in ferrets increased when light duration 75 or intensity increased [27]. Since then, further research has described ferret oestrus as 76 seasonal and photoperiod activated [28]. The relationship between photoperiod, oestrus 77 and body weight is unknown, but Donovan (1986) concluded that while there was not a 78 critical weight to trigger oestrus, oestrus does require a minimum weight of around 420g.
The aim of this study is to provide data on the normative weights of female ferrets, 80 accounting for seasonal changes over multiple years. In addition, we document changes 81 in weight that occur due to water regulation. We hypothesized that controlled light 82 exposure in animal care facilities would induce naturalistic fluctuations in the ferrets' body 83 weight.
Animals 93 The data from 39 healthy female pigmented ferrets (0.5  4 years) were used for this 94 study. All animals underwent behavioural testing in psychoacoustic tasks that required 95 regulated access to water. Water was available during twice daily testing sessions, with 96 supplementary wet food and/or water provided to ensure animals received a minimum of 97 60 ml/kg of water. Testing took place from Monday to Friday in, roughly, a three weeks 98 on and one week off schedule. This ensured that ferrets did not experience water 99 regulation more than 50% of the time. When not participating in behavioural testing, 100 animals had free access to water. During testing periods, each animal was weighed daily 101 using digital scales (Salter, UK) prior to their morning testing session. Data was obtained"	0

845	We estimated the cumulative total number of children infected with SARS CoV 2 in the United States for each day from March 18 to April 6 by dividing the PICU cumulative case count (described earlier) by an adjusted pediatric criticality proportion derived from an empirical study of COVID 19 in children in China. The first factor was an estimate of the overall SARS CoV 2 reporting rate for China, derived from a peer reviewed spatiotemporal infection dynamics modeling study recently published in Science.18 The authors modeled 3 time periods.20 The model for the period January 24 to February 8 (the period of time with the best overlap with the Dong et al9 case series) estimated that 69% (95% CI, 66 71) of SARS CoV 2 cases were detected by laboratory testing (see page 42 of the Li et al20 online technical supplement for these modeling results). US hospitals have been advised to implement social distancing and quarantine protocols that include limiting or prohibiting visitors for adult COVID 19 patients.27 In New York, special considerations have been given to children for whom the visitor is a needed advocate and caregiver.28 However, child hospital companions may also be infected with COVID 19 themselves and will require both logistical and infection control accommodations that place an additional strain on hospital resources.	0
846	This century is witnessing dramatic changes in the health needs of the world's populations. The double burden of infectious and chronic diseases constitutes major causes of morbidity and mortality. Over the last two decades, there has been a rise in infectious diseases, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), the H1N1 pandemic influenza, the Ebolavirus and the Covid 19 virus. These diseases have rapidly spread across the world and have reminded us of the unprecedented connectivity that defines our modern civilization. Though some countries have made substantial progress toward improving global surveillance for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), the vast majority of Low and Middle income Countries (LMICs) with fragile health systems and various system related bottlenecks remain vulnerable to outbreaks and, as such, experience dramatic social and economic consequences when they are reported. Lessons learned from past outbreaks suggest that gender inequalities are common across a range of health issues relating to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), with women being particularly disadvantaged, partially due to the burden placed on them. Though these countries are striving to improve their health systems and be more inclusive to this vulnerable group, the national/ global outbreaks have burdened the overall system and thus paralyzed normal services dedicated to the delivery of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services. In this paper, we discuss the global commitments to SRH, the impact of the EIDs on the LMICs, the failure in the delivery of SRH services, and the strategies for successful implementation of recovery plans that must address the settings.	0

848	"Background: Since late December 2019, a novel coronavirus has emerged in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout China. Fears were raised higher, effective policies for prevention and control were concerned.
: Till March 3, 91273 confirmed COVID 19 cases were included in. Using Mann Whitney U test, the provinces that reported the life tracks of confirmed cases to public had lower increased in daily new confirmed cases. Results: Compared with the paired province, Tianjin, Jilin, Gansu, Shanxi, Hainan and Guizhou had significant differences in the number of new confirmed cases and have lower mean rank (P<0.05).
Shanghai had a lower mean rank (P=0.175) but no significant difference. Besides, the successful prevention and control work need other effective strategies, such as real time media coverage, isolating the suspected cases or close contacts, delaying the return of work, closing schools, wearing facial masks, and disinfecting the communities, et.al.
Strategies must be adjusted in real time according to the epidemic. Reporting the life tracks of confirmed cases was an effective way to control the epidemic. They may be suggestions to other counties with an outbreak of COVID 19."	0
849	"Three anti HIV drugs, ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir, might have therapeutic effect on coronavirus disease 2019 . In this study, the structure models of two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) proteases, coronavirus endopeptidase C30 (CEP_C30) and papain like viral protease (PLVP), were built by homology modeling. Ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir were then docked to the models, respectively, followed by energy minimization of the protease drug complexes. In the simulations, ritonavir can bind to CEP_C30 most suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; lopinavir can also bind to CEP_C30 suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; darunavir can bind to PLVP suitably with slight conformation changes of PLVP. It is suggested that the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID 19 may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS CoV 2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP.

It takes into account that the growth in the number of infected individuals increases the initial viral load and provides a passage from the first stage of epidemic where only people with weak immune response are infected to the second stage where people with strong immune response are also infected. This scenario may be viewed as an increase of the effective number of susceptible increasing the effective growth rate of infected.	1

853	"medRxiv preprint [Abstract]Objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) has become pandemic in the world. The need for IgG IgM combined antibody test is booming, but data on diagnostic indexes evaluation was inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic indexes of a rapid IgG IgM combined antibody test for SARS CoV 2. Methods A total of 179 patients were enrolled. Serum were collected for IgG IgM combined antibody test and corresponding nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for SARS CoV 2 RT PCR. According to SARS CoV 2 RT PCR results, patients under study were categorized as PCR positive group in 90 patients and PCR negative group in 89 patients. Results 1. Of the 90 PCR positive samples, 77 were tested positive by SARS CoV 2 IgG IgM test kit, yielding a sensitivity of 85.6%. Meanwhile, of the 89 PCR negative sample, 8 samples were detected positive, resulting in a specificity of 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of this test kit was 95.1%, 82.7%, and 88.3%, respectively. Kappa efficiency between IgG/IgM test kit and RT PCR were 0.75. 2. Accuracy in mild/common and severe/critical subgroup were 73.9% and 97.7%, respectively. Accuracy in clinical confirmed, suspected cases and other disease subgroups were 70%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. 3. Patients were further divided into '0  7', '8  15' and '>= 16' groups according to the time from illness onset to sample collection.
Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in these three groups were 18.8%, 77.8% and 40%; 100%, 50% and 87.5%; 100%, 64.3%, and 93.9, respectively. Conclusion The sensitivity and specificity of this ease of use IgG/IgM combined test kit were adequate, plus short turnaround time, no specific requirements for additional equipment or skilled technicians, all of these collectively contributed to its competence for mass testing. At the current stage, it cannot take the place of SARA CoV 2 nucleic acid RT PCR, but can be served as a complementary option for RT PCR.

854	As a result of the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic , there has been an urgent worldwide demand for treatments. Due to factors such as history of prescription for other infectious diseases, availability, and relatively low cost, the use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been tested in vivo and in vitro for the ability to inhibit the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). However, even though investigators noted the therapeutic potential of these drugs, it is important to consider the toxicological risks and necessary care for rational use of CQ and HCQ. This study provides information on the main to be considered for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID 19 using CQ but mainly HCQ, which is a less toxic derivative than CQ, and was shown to produce better results in inhibiting proliferation of SARS CoV 2 based upon preliminary tests.	1

858	One major bottleneck in the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic is the limited number of critical care beds. Due to the dynamic development of infections and the time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can easily be underestimated. To derive future ICU load from reported infections, we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2) allows for making predictions depending on different future growth rates. We evaluate our model for public data from Berlin, Germany, by first estimating the model parameters (i.e., time lag and average stay in ICU) for March 2020 and then using an exponential model to predict the future ICU load for April and May 2020. Assuming an ICU rate of 5%, a time lag of 5 days and an average stay of 14 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data and is in accord with independent estimates. Our model is then used to predict future ICU load assuming a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0 15%). For example, based on our parameters the model predicts that the number of ICU patients at the end of May would be 246 if the exponential growth were to continue at a rate of 3%, 1,056 if the growth rate were 5% and 3,758 if the growth rate were 7%. The model can be adjusted as estimates of parameters develop and can thus also help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity. Although our predictions are based on a small data set, disregard non stationary dynamics, and have a number of assumptions, especially an exponential development of cases, our model is simple, available.	0

864	"Background: New endemic disease has been spread across Wuhan City, China on December 2019. Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 . In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a ""public health emergency of international concern"" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus the objective a multi epitope peptide vaccine against COVID 19 using immunoinformatics approach. Method: Several techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T cell epitopes based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019 nCoV as a target. Results: Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in COVID 19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively. Conclusion: T cell epitopes based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID 19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine is rapidly needed to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety, immunogenic profile and to help on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks."	1

866	"We propose a simple SIR model in order to investigate the impact of various confinement strategies on a most virulent epidemic. Our approach is motivated by the current COVID 19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is the existence of two populations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement and for which the infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non confined for various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The model, initially formulated as a differential system, is discretised following a specific procedure, the discrete system serving as an integrator for the differential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is observed in the COVID 19 epidemic.
Several conclusions can be reached, despite the very simple structure of our model. First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by just analysing data from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn out that the epidemic has reached a sizeable part of the world months before it became noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal feature of all our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a rekindling of the epidemic. Thus we sought the conditions for the second epidemic peak to be lower than the first one. This is possible in all the scenarios considered (abrupt, progressive or stepwise exit) but typically a progressive exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the progressive exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too different. From our results, the most promising strategy is that of a stepwise exit. And in fact its implementation could be quite feasible, with the major part of the population (minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously but obeying rigorous distancing constraints.

Preprint platforms that were launched up to 25 th June 2019 and have a biomedical and medical scope according to MEDLINE's journal selection criteria were identified using existing lists, web based searches and the expertise of both academic and non academic publication scientists. A data extraction form was developed, pilot tested and used to collect data from each preprint platform's webpage(s). Data collected were in relation to scope and ownership; content specific characteristics and information relating to submission, journal transfer options, and external discoverability; screening, moderation, and permanence of content; usage metrics and metadata. Where possible, all online data were verified by the platform owner or representative by correspondence.
A total of 44 preprint platforms were identified as having biomedical and medical scope, 17 (39%) were hosted by the Open Science Framework preprint infrastructure, six (14%) were provided by F1000 Research Ltd (the Open Research Central infrastructure) and 21 (48%) were other independent preprint platforms. Preprint platforms were either owned by non profit academic groups, scientific societies or funding organisations (n=28; 64%), owned/partly owned by for profit publishers or companies (n=14; 32%) or owned by individuals/small communities (n=2; 5%). Twenty four (55%) preprint platforms accepted content from all scientific fields although some of these had restrictions relating to funding source, geographical region or an affiliated journal's remit. Thirty three (75%) preprint platforms provided details about article screening (basic checks) and 14 (32%) of these actively involved researchers with context expertise in the screening process. The three most common screening checks related to the scope of the article, plagiarism and legal/ethical/societal issues and compliance. Almost all preprint platforms allow submission to any peer reviewed journal following publication, have a preservation plan for read access, and most have a policy regarding reasons for retraction and the sustainability of the service. Forty one (93%) platforms currently have usage metrics, with the most common metric being the number of downloads presented on the abstract page.
A large number of preprint platforms exist for use in biomedical and medical sciences, all of which offer researchers an opportunity to rapidly disseminate their research findings onto an open access public server, subject to scope and eligibility. However, the process by which content is screened before online posting and withdrawn or removed after posting varies between platforms, which may be associated with platform operation, ownership, governance and financing."	0

875	Epizootic pathogens pose a major threat to many wildlife species, particularly in the context of rapidly changing environments. Pangolins (order Pholidota) are highly threatened mammals, in large part due to the trade in illegal wildlife. During July to August 2018 four sick wild pangolins (three Manis javanica and one Manis pentadactyla) exhibiting a variety of clinical symptoms were rescued by the Jinhua Wildlife Protection Station in Zhejiang province, China. Although three of these animals died, fortunately one recovered after 2 weeks of symptomatic treatment. Using meta transcriptomics combined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR), we identified two novel RNA viruses in two of the dead pangolins. Genomic analysis revealed that these viruses were most closely related to pestiviruses and coltiviruses, although still highly genetically distinct, with more than 48 and 25 per cent sequence divergence at the amino acid level, respectively. We named these Dongyang pangolin virus (DYPV) and Lishui pangolin virus (LSPV) based on the sampling site and hosts. Although coltiviruses (LSPV) are known to be transmitted by ticks, we found no evidence of LSPV in ticks sampled close to where the pangolins were collected. In addition, although DYPV was present in nymph ticks (Amblyomma javanense) collected from a diseased pangolin, they were not found in the local tick population. Epidemiological investigation revealed that both novel viruses might have been imported following the illegal international trade of pangolins. Hence, these data indicate that illegal wildlife trafficking not only threatens the status of pangolin populations, but may also spread epizootic pathogens.	0

Although people at the extremes of age have a greater risk of complications, influenza has been more frequently investigated in the elderly than in children, and inpatients than outpatients. Yearly vaccination with trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines is the main strategy to control influenza. Objectives: Determine the clinical and molecular characteristics of influenza A and B infections in children and adolescents with influenza like illness (ILI).
Methods: A cohort of outpatient children and adolescents with ILI was followed for 20 months. Influenza was diagnosed with commercial multiplex PCR platforms.
: 179 patients had 277 episodes of ILI, being 79 episodes of influenza A and 20 episodes of influenza B. Influenza A and B cases were mild and had similar presentation. Phylogenetic tree of influenza B viruses showed that 91.6% belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage, which is not included in trivalent vaccines. Conclusions: Influenza A and B are often detected in children and adolescents with ILI episodes, with similar and mild presentation in outpatients. The mismatch between the circulating influenza viruses and the trivalent vaccine offered in Brazil may have contributed to the high frequency of influenza A and B in this population."	0

We proposed using Poisson mixtures model that utilized data of deaths, recoveries, and total confirmed cases in each day since the outbreak. We demonstrated that our CFR estimates for Hubei Province and other parts of China were superior to the simple CFR estimators in the early stage of COVID 19 outbreak. : medRxiv preprint 6 | P a g e February, and that for the other parts of China were all very close to the actual CFR on the first day of CFR estimation (25 th January). The performance of the Poisson mixtures model for Hubei Province started to overestimate the CFR starting from mid March when the daily confirmed cases dropped to single digit onwards and the simple CFR estimator began to converge. Similarly, the performance of our model for other parts of China became inferior to the simple CFR estimator starting from late February when the daily confirmed cases dropped from 200 800 to less than 30.
Our CFR estimates for Hubei Province and other parts of China were superior to the simple CFR estimators. Making use of all real time information available for COVID 19, including the number of deaths, recoveries, and total confirmed cases for every single day during the outbreak, our proposed CFR estimates for Hubei Province were acceptable even at the very early stage of the COVID 19 pandemic of mid February (4.5% to 7%) at which the simple CFR estimators overestimated the actual CFR by more than five folds. Similarly, we achieved CFR estimates for other parts of China at a reasonable level of 1.5% to 1.6% with data up to late January at which the simple CFRs were in the range between 15% and 35%.
Similar to the gamma mixtures model, our proposed model that substituted gamma distribution with Poisson distribution, the CFR estimate was reasonable at the early stage of the disease outbreak, however, the estimate was positively biased in the later stage. We believed that this finding reflected that the actual CFR was changing over time at the later stage of the COVID 19 pandemic, and fitting the data with a constant CFR model may not be appropriate. To test this hypothesis, we can allow the Poisson mixtures model to have one CFR at a time range and another CFR in the other time range, and test the equivalence of these two CFRs. This test of time varying CFR could also be used to examine the effectiveness of population level interventions. : medRxiv preprint 7 | P a g e The Poisson mixtures model proposed here can be applied to countries in the early and middle stages of the COVID 19 outbreak, for example, the US, Spain, Italy, France, and Germany.
However, note that the validity of our model relied on several assumptions, including the constant nature of CFR and the identification of deaths, recoveries, and confirmed cases. The constant CFR assumption may not be appropriate if effective treatments were invented within the disease outbreak.

Objectives Develop a draft pandemic specific triage assessment score for the current COVID 19 pandemic. Design a website where initial Toward a COVID 19 Scores (TACS) can be quickly calculated and used to compare various treatment strategies. Create a TACS Registry where data and outcomes for suspected and confirmed COVID 19 patients can be recorded. Use the TACS Registry to develop an influenza epidemic specific database and score for use in future respiratory based epidemics.
Retrospective analysis of 3,301 ICU admissions with respiratory failure admitted to 41 U.S. Intensive Care Units from 2015 19. Independent external validation on 1,175 similar ICU Admissions using identical entry criteria from Barnes Jewish Hospital (BJH), Washington University from 2016 2019.
Main Outcomes TACS was created with 16 readily available predictive variables for risk assessment of hospital mortality 24 hours after ICU Admission and the need for prolonged assisted mechanical ventilation (PAMV) ( > 96 hours) at 24 and 48 hours post ICU admission.
Results TACS achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for hospital mortality after 24 hours of 0.80 in the development dataset; 0.81 in the internal validation dataset. At a probability of 50% hospital mortality, positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.55, negative predictive value (NPV) 0.89; sensitivity 22%, specificity 97%. For PAMV after 24 hours, the AUC was 0.84 in the development dataset, 0.81 in the validation dataset. For PAMV after 48 hours, the AUC was 0.82 in the development dataset, 0.78 in the validation dataset. In the external validation the AUC for TACS was 0.76  / 0.024. We launched a website that is scaled for mobile device use ( https://covid19score.azurewebsites.net/) that provides open access to a user friendly TACS Calculator for all predictions. We also designed a voluntary TACS Registry for collection of data and outcomes on ICU Admissions with COVID 19."	0
881	Background: Since the outbreak of 2019 nCoV in December, Chinese government has implemented various measures including travel bans, centralized treatments, and home quarantines to slowing the transmission across the country. In this study, we aimed to estimate the incidence of 2019 nCoV infection among people under home quarantine in Shenzhen, China. Methods: We used a stratified multistage random sampling method to recruit participants and collected demographic information and laboratory results of people under home quarantine. We conducted descriptive analysis to estimate the basic characteristics and to calculate the incidence in out study population. Results: A total of 2004 people under home quarantine participated in this study, of which 1637 participants finished the questionnaire with a response rate of 81.7%. Mean age of the participants was 33.7 years, ranging from 0.3 to 80.2 years. Of people who provided clear travel history, 129 people have traveled to Wuhan city and 1,046 people have traveled to other cities in Hubei province within 14 days before the home quarantine. Few (less than 1%) participants reported contact history with confirmed or suspected cases during their trip and most of these arrived at	0

Social distancing and lockdown measures modifies people's habits, while the Internet gains a major role to support remote working, e teaching, online collaboration, gaming, video streaming, etc. All these sudden changes put unprecedented stress on the network.
In this paper we analyze the impact of the lockdown enforcement on the Politecnico di Torino campus network. Right after the school shutdown on the 25 th of February, PoliTO deployed its own in house solution for virtual teaching. Ever since, the university provides about 600 virtual classes daily, serving more than 16 000 students per day. Here, we report a picture of how the pandemic changed PoliTO's network traffic. We first focus on the usage of remote working and collaborative platforms. Given the peculiarity of PoliTO in house online teaching solution, we drill down on it, characterizing both the audience and the network footprint. Overall, we present a snapshot of the abrupt changes on campus traffic and learning due to COVID 19, and testify how the Internet has operations."	0
883	"During the current COVID 19 pandemic, testing kit and RNA extraction kit availability has become a major limiting factor in the ability to determine patient disease status and accurately quantify prevalence. Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS CoV 2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID 19.
Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low risk individuals. Drawing on the well studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a them to adopt behavioral changes to slow the spread of COVID 19."	0

885	"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (CoV) epidemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  2 (SARS CoV 2) emerged from China. This virus causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19). Since then, there have been anecdotal reports of ocular infection. The ocular implications of human CoV infections have not been widely studied. However, CoVs have been known to cause various ocular infections in animals. Clinical entities such as conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis have been documented in feline and murine models. In this article, the current evidence suggesting possible human CoV infection of ocular tissue is reviewed. The review article will also highlight animal CoVs and their associated ocular infections. We hope that this article will serve as a start for further research into the ocular implications of human CoV infections.

The infection shows the primary symptoms of pneumonia and has an incubation period, with the majority of people showing symptoms within 14 days. Online Social Networks are the closest simulations of real world networks and have similar topology characteristics. This article simulates the spread and control of the nCoV 19 using the SIQR t model to highlight the importance of self quarantine and exercise of proper health care as a method to prevent the spread of the virus.
The article uses the Susceptible Infected Quarantined Recovered model with modification, introducing 14 different Infected states depending on the number of days the host has been carrying the infection. We simulate the spread of 2019 nCoV on human interaction similar graph taken from Online Social Network Epinions, of about 75000 nodes, similar to a small town or settlement. The infection rates depend on the sanitation and cleanliness these people exercise.
When people practice self quarantine and hygiene, aided by the governmental efforts of testing and quarantine, the cumulative number of affected people fall drastically. The decrease is apparent in time based simulations of the spread received from the study.
The 2019 nCoV is a highly infectious zoonotic virus. It has spread like a pandemic, and governments across the world have launched quarantines. The results of the SIQR t model indicate that hygiene and social distancing can reduce its impact and sharply decrease the infection scale. Individual efforts are key to the control."	0

These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations.
In our study, we demonstrate that nonidentifiability in model calibrations using the confirmed case data is the main reason for such wide variations. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed case data. This indicates that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model. We present our model predictions for the COVID 19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and quarantine of the city on January 23, 2020.

895	A pandemic of a novel Coronavirus emerged in December of 2019 , causing devastating public health impact across the world. In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals, strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, contact tracing, quarantine, isolation, and the use of face masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by R c ), is less than unity. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID 19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti COVID non pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict socialdistancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social distancing measures are crucially important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID 19 pandemic. This study shows that early termination of the strict socialdistancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social distancing measures were implemented. The use of efficacious face masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy ≥ 70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID 19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti COVID 19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. This study emphasizes the important role social distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID 19. Increases in the adherence level of socialdistancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID 19. Using face masks in public (including the low efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of COVID 19, provided their coverage level is high. The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID 19 decreases if the masks based intervention is combined with the strict social distancing strategy.	0

898	"OBJECTIVES: To determine the viruses and risk factors associated with hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in infants with acute bronchiolitis.
INTRODUCTION: Bronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity in infants. Widespread use of molecular based methods has yielded new insights about its etiology, but the impact of viral etiologies on early outcomes is still unclear.
METHODS: Seventy seven infants with bronchiolitis who were under two years of age and visited an emergency unit were included. Using molecular based methods, samples were tested for 12 different respiratory viruses. Logistic regression models were used to identify clinical and virological variables associated with the main endpoints: hospital admission and ICU admission.
We identified at least one virus in 93.5% of patients, and coinfections were found in nearly 40% of patients. RSV was the most common pathogen (63.6%), followed by rhinovirus (39%). Identification of RSV was only associated with an increased risk of hospital admission in the univariate model. Younger age and enterovirus infection were associated with an increased risk of hospital admission, while atopy of a first degree relative showed a protective effect. Prematurity was associated with an increased risk of admission to the ICU. Coinfections were not associated with worse outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular based methods resulted in high rates of viral identification but did not change the significant role of RSV in acute bronchiolitis. Younger age and enterovirus infection were risk factors for hospital admission, while prematurity appeared to be a significant risk factor for admission to the ICU in acute viral bronchiolitis."	0

900	The coronavirus disease pandemic has led to a devastating effect on the global public health. Computed Tomography (CT) is an effective tool in the screening of COVID 19. It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately segment COVID 19 from CT to help diagnostic and patient monitoring. In this paper, we propose a U Net based segmentation network using attention mechanism. As not all the features extracted from the encoders are useful for segmentation, we propose to incorporate an attention mechanism including a spatial and a channel attention, to a U Net architecture to re weight the feature representation spatially and channel wise to capture rich contextual relationships for better feature representation. In addition, the focal tversky loss is introduced to deal with small lesion segmentation. The experiment results, evaluated on a COVID 19 CT segmentation dataset where 473 CT slices are available, demonstrate the proposed method can achieve an accurate and rapid segmentation on COVID 19 segmentation. The method takes only 0.29 second to segment a single CT slice. The obtained Dice Score, Sensitivity and Specificity are 83.1%, 86.7% and 99.3%, respectively.	0

We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV 27 OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into 28 C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential 29 susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and 30 LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at 31 significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression 32 of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV OC43. While 33 overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV 34 OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to 35
HCoV OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry 36 mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently 37 pandemic SARS CoV 2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or 38 amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus 39 entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The 40 work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that 41 controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism."	0

911	"Motivation: Accurately determining the atomic structure of proteins represents a fundamental problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm. Results: We trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. Furthermore, we detected secondary structure information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo EM density map, considering 20 different types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly improved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours. Availability: The repository of this project will be published.

913	Coronavirus disease 2019 has infected more than one million individuals all over the world and caused more than 55,000 deaths, as of April 3 in 2020. Radiological findings are important sources in guiding the diagnosis and treatment of COVID 19. However, the existing studies on how radiological findings are correlated with COVID 19 are conducted separately by different hospitals, which may be inconsistent or even conflicting due to population bias. To address this problem, we develop natural language processing methods to analyze a large collection of COVID 19 literature containing study reports from hospitals all over the world, reconcile these results, and draw unbiased and universally sensible conclusions about the correlation between radiological findings and COVID 19. We apply our method to the CORD 19 dataset and successfully extract a set of radiological findings that are closely tied to COVID 19.	1
914	We present a stochastic optimization model for allocating and sharing a critical resource in the case of a pandemic. The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory for a central agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID 19 pandemic by FEMA to different US states. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non COVID 19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs in slightly above average demand scenarios. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non COVID 19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In a severe case, where the demand is concentrated in the top most quartile of the forecast confidence interval and states are not willing to share their stockpile of ventilators, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till 05/31/20) is about 232,000 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 17,200 ventilators on 04/19/2020. Results are also reported for a worst case where interval.	0

Rapid and informed guidance of 29 epidemic (research) responses to severe infectious disease outbreaks requires quick 30 compilation and integration of existing pathophysiological knowledge. As a case 31 study we chose the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak that started in 2015 to develop a 32 proof of concept knowledge repository.

920	"The recent global pandemic of COVID 19 highlights the urgent need for practical applications of anti microbial coatings on touch surfaces. Nanostructured TiO 2 is a promising candidate for the passive reduction of transmission when applied to handles, push plates and switches in hospitals.
Here we report control of the nanostructure dimension of the mille feuille crystal plates in anatase columnar crystals as a function of the coating thickness. This nanoplate thickness is key to achieving the large aspect ratio of surface area to migration path length. TiO 2 solid coatings were prepared by pulsed pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (pp MOCVD) under the same deposition temperature and mass flux, with thickness ranging from 1.3 16 µm, by varying the number of precursor pulses. SEM and STEM were used to measure the mille feuille plate width which is believed to be a key functional nano dimension for photocatalytic activity. Competitive growth produces a larger columnar crystal diameter with thickness. The question is if the nano dimension also increases with columnar crystal size. We report that the nano dimension increases with the film thickness, ranging from 17 42 nm. The results of this study can be used to design a coating which has co optimized thickness for durability and nano dimension for enhanced photocatalytic properties.

921	"Background: International students frequently return to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFR), and are at increased risk of travel associated infections. Little is known of their travel health seeking behaviours. China is the biggest source of international students studying in Australia and the unprecedented epidemic of COVID 19 in China makes this an important area of research. Methods: Focus groups of Chinese international students were conducted to explore travel health related knowledge, attitudes and practices. Eligible participants were studying in Sydney, and had travelled to China and Hong Kong to visit friends and relatives in the preceding 18 months. A variety of topics were explored, using a focus group guide. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the transcripts using nVivo software. The list of codes and themes were not predetermined but developed through content analysis. Results: Two focus groups were held with a total of 28 participants. Risk perception about VFR travel was generally low among Chinese international students. Pre travel healthcare was not sought. Students strongly relied on the Internet, social media, parents and friends in China for travel health advice. Conclusion: This research provides insights into Chinese international students as VFR travellers. It confirms students could be a risk population for importations of infections such as COVID 19 because of low risk perception and lack of seeking travel health advice. This can inform health promotion strategies for students. ª
International students are a potential source of outbreaks on campus. Chinese international students severely underestimate infectious risks of VFR travel. They often rely on the internet for health advice and outbreak information. They do not see any need for professional pre travel medical advice or vaccination. They face multiple cultural and systemic barriers in accessing health care."	0

925	"The COVID 19 pandemic is still in its early stages and given the speed and magnitude of local outbreaks it is urgent to understand how mitigation measures translate into changes in key epidemiological and clinical outcomes. Here, we employ a mathematical model to explore the short term consequences of lowering the reproduction number ℛ0 and delaying measures on total infections and fatalities. The positive implications of mitigation generally accrue as these measures are adopted early, with the most striking effects seen when the reproductive number is lowered to a level ℛC≈1.0. As the delay in adopting measures exceeds approximately the half way point to the peak of an outbreak, the effects of lowering ℛ0 markedly decrease.
Aiming for reproduction numbers close to 1.0 can substantially reduce fatality probabilities over short time scales, particularly for larger populations. We conclude that research is urgently needed on how mitigation measures impact ℛ0 and how these can be optimized so as to achieve ℛC≈1.0 whilst supporting individual freedoms, society and the economy."	0

935	Viruses are evolving at an alarming rate, spreading and inconspicuously adapting to cutting edge therapies. Therefore, the search for rapid, informative and reliable diagnostic methods is becoming urgent as ever. Conventional clinical tests (PCR, serology, etc.) are being continually optimized, yet provide very limited data. Could high throughput sequencing (HTS) become the future gold standard in molecular diagnostics of viral infections? Compared to conventional clinical tests, HTS is universal and more precise at profiling pathogens. Nevertheless, it has not yet been widely accepted as a diagnostic tool, owing primarily to its high cost and the complexity of sample preparation and data analysis. Those obstacles must be tackled to integrate HTS into daily clinical practice. For this, three objectives are to be achieved: (1) designing and assessing universal protocols for library preparation, (2) assembling purpose specific pipelines, and (3) building computational infrastructure to suit the needs and financial abilities of modern healthcare centers. Data harvested with HTS could not only augment diagnostics and help to choose the correct therapy, but also facilitate research in epidemiology, genetics and virology. This information, in turn, could significantly aid clinicians in battling viral infections.	0

Harmful effects of aerosols from a pneumoperitoneum with the virus present have not yet been quantified. Measures for the protection of HCPs are an extrapolation of those taken during other epidemics. They must still be mandatory to minimise the risk of viral contamination. Protection measures include personal protection equipment for HCPs, adaptation of surgical technique (method for obtaining pneumoperitoneum, filters, preferred intracorporeal anastomosis, precautions during the exsufflation of the pneumoperitoneum), and organisation of the operating room.	0

We observe that US marketstructure has dramatically changed during the past four weeks and that the level of change has followed the number of infected cases reported in the USA. Presently, market structure resembles most closely the structure during the middle of the 2008 crisis but there are signs that it may be starting to evolve into a new structure altogether. This is the first article of a series where we will be analysing and discussing market structure as it evolves to a state of further instability or, more optimistically, stabilisation and recovery.	0
942	During decades, mathematical models have been used to predict the behavior of physical and biologic systems, and to define strategies aiming the minimization of the effects regarding different types of diseases. In the present days, the development of mathematical models to simulate the dynamic behavior of novel coronavirus disease (COVID 19) is considered an important theme due to the quantity of infected people worldwide. In this work, the aim is to determine an optimal control strategy for vaccine administration in COVID 19 pandemic treatment considering real data from China. For this purpose, an inverse problem is formulated and solved in order to determine the parameters of the compartmental SIR (Susceptible Infectious Recovered) model. To solve such inverse problem, the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is employed. After this step, two optimal control problems (mono and multi objective) to determine the optimal strategy for vaccine administration in COVID 19 pandemic treatment are proposed. The first consists of minimizing the quantity of infected individuals during the treatment. The second considers minimizing together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine concentration during the treatment, i.e., a multi objective optimal control problem. The solution of each optimal control problems is obtained using DE and Multi Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithms, respectively. The results regarding the proposed multi objective optimal control problem provides a set of evidences from which an optimal strategy for vaccine administration can be chosen, according to a given criterion.	0
943	COVID 19 pandemic has become a major threat to the country. Till date, well tested medication or antidote is not available to cure this disease. According to WHO reports, COVID 19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome which is transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Analysis of this disease requires major attention by the Government to take necessary steps in reducing the effect of this global pandemic. In this study, outbreak of this disease has been analysed for India till 30 th March 2020 and predictions have been made for the number of cases for the next 2 weeks. SEIR model and Regression model have been used for predictions based on the data collected from John Hopkins University repository in the time period of 30 th January 2020 to 30 th March 2020. The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSLE and achieved 1.52 for SEIR model and 1.75 for the regression model. The RMSLE error rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01. Also, the value of R 0 which is the spread of the disease was calculated to be 2.02. Expected cases may rise between 5000 6000 in the next two weeks of time. This study will help the Government and doctors in preparing their plans for the next two weeks. Based on the predictions for short term interval, these models can be tuned for forecasting in long term intervals.	0

945	Mathematical modeling is a process aimed at finding a mathematical description of a system and translating it into a relational expression. When a system is continuously changing over time (e.g., infectious diseases) differential equations, which may include parameters, are used for modeling the system. The process of finding those parameters that best fit the given data from the system is called an inverse problem. This study aims at analyzing the novel coronavirus infection (COVID 19) spread in South Korea using the susceptible infectedrecovered (SIR) model. We collect the data from Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC). We assume that each parameter in the SIR model is a function of time so that we can compute important parameters, such as the basic reproduction number (R0), more delicately. Using neural networks, we propose a method to find the best time varying parameters and the solution for the model simultaneously. Moreover, using time dependent parameters, we find that traditional numerical algorithms, such as the Runge Kutta methods, can successfully approximate the SIR model while fitting the COVID 19 data, thus modeling the propagation patterns of COVID 19 more precisely.	0
946	"The objective of the present study is to reveal the acceptance and preference for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease vaccination in health care workers (HCWs). We performed an internet based, region stratified survey among 352 HCWs and 189 individuals in the general population enrolled on March 17 th and 18 th 2020 from 26 Chinese provinces. The HCWs developed a more in depth understanding of SARS Coronavirus 2 infection and showed a higher tolerance to the future vaccination than the general population. 76.4% of HCWs (vs. 72.5% in the general) showed their willingness to receive vaccination. Potential benefits from COVID 19 outbreak such as seeking influenza (65.3%) or pneumonia (55.7%) vaccination can be gained in HCWs. To estimate the relative effects of attributes influencing vaccination choice in the discrete choice experiment, 7 attributes (3 disease relevant, 3 vaccine relevant, and 1 of social acceptance) were identified as key determinants. Among them, disease trend (odds ratio, OR: 4.367 (95%CI, 3.721 5.126) for seasonal epidemic, OR: 3.069 (2.612 3.605) for persistent epidemic, with reference to disappearance in summer), social contacts' decisions (0.398: 0.339 0.467 for refusal, 0.414: 0.353 0.487 for neutral, with reference to acceptance) and high possibility of being infected (2.076: 1.776 2.425 for infection probability of 30%  ) were significantly associated with increased probability of choosing vaccination in the HCWs. In contrast, for the general population, vaccine safety and social contacts' decisions were the most important predictors. For COVID 19
vaccination, education in HCWs should be taken as a priority, and further benefits of its recommendation to the general public will also be anticipated."	0

Texte d'expert Prise en charge des infections des voies respiratoires basses de l'immunocompétent.

Definitions, epidemiology, and diagnostic features F. Philippart Service de réanimation polyvalente, fondation hôpital Saint Joseph, 185, rue Raymond Losserand, 75014 Paris, France Reçu le 2 juin 2006 ; accepté le 21 juillet 2006 Disponible sur internet le 07 novembre 2006
Les infections respiratoires basses sont une des principales cause de mortalité dans le monde et les pneumopathies représentent en France la première cause de décès d'origine infectieuse. Trois entités nosologiques distinctes sont habituellement isolées en fonction de la localisation infectieuse : la bronchite aiguë, la pneumopathie et la bronchopneumopathie (atteignant les bronches et le parenchyme pulmonaire). En cas d'infections de l'arbre bronchique dans le cadre d'une bronchopathie chronique on parle de décompensation infectieuse de la maladie bronchique. Les deux principales difficultés diagnostiques de ces infections sont de déterminer la présence d'une participation alvéolaire au processus infectieux et de définir l'agent (ou les agents) pathogènes. Ces deux éléments vont conditionner la prise en charge thérapeutique. En dehors de l'examen physique, indispensable dans ce contexte, seule la radiographie thoracique pourra, en cas de persistance d'un doute, permettre de confirmer la présence d'une participation alvéolaire. Le diagnostic microbiologique pose la question de sa nécessité systématique et celui de sa valeur. Il n'est pas indispensable de réaliser un diagnostic microbiologique de certitude dans tous les cas. La décision de documentation doit répondre à deux impératifs : faisabilité et valeur diagnostique. La valeur d'un prélèvement dépend de son aptitude à mettre en évidence l'agent pathogène et dans certains cas de la possibilité d'en déterminer le profil de sensibilité (qui reste une indication majeure à la réalisation de ces prélèvements).
Particular attention is given to lower respiratory tract infections because of their frequency and potential severity. These infections represent a major cause of death worldwide and pneumonia remains the first cause of death from infectious origin in France. Three nosological entities are usually described according to the anatomic localization of the infectious process: acute bronchitis, pneumonia, and bronchopneumonia (if the infection involves the bronchial tree and the lung parenchyma). If bronchial infection occurs within the context of a chronic respiratory tract disease, it is called acute decompensation of chronic lung disease (usually chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The major diagnostic difficulties are to be able to confirm alveolar implication in the infectious process and to determine the pathogenic agent(s) responsible for the clinical pattern. This information is essential for subsequent care depends. Apart from clinical examination, essential in this context, only chest X rays can be of any help to confirm alveolar involvement in the disease process. On the contrary, the interest of systematic microbiological confirmation and its value according to various techniques and swab conditions may be questioned for the clinical diagnosis. Microbiological confirmation does not seem essential in every case. The feasibility and relevance of microbiological techniques must be determined before any decision is taken on documentation. The microbiological documentation value depends on its yield and sensitivity profile in identifying the pathogen."	0

952	Since then, the new coronavirus, which causes Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and is now known as MERS CoV, has infected >2,494 individuals across 27 countries and led to the death of at least 858 individuals as of November 2019, through a series of emergences and re emergences from camelid hosts (7). To date, no evidence supports that SARS CoV 2 is man made: COVID 19 closely resembles two other coronaviruses that have triggered outbreaks in recent decades, SARS CoV 1 (79% sequence identity) and MERS CoV (51.8% identity) (19), and all three viruses are most likely to have originated in bats (17,20): SARS CoV 2 has a 96% sequence identity with a recently sequenced bat coronavirus recovered from the wild by random sampling (21). ACE2 is also diffusely located on other cells, such as mucosal cells of the intestines, endothelial cells of veins and arteries including heart cells, epithelial cells of the renal tubules, epithelial cells of the kidneys, immune cells and cerebral neuronal cells, which may also be susceptible to coronavirus infections. The observation of COVID 19 patient demise on account of severe heart failure brought about by SARS CoV 2 infection and the higher risk among patients with previous cardiovascular and hypertensive disease has driven multiple hypotheses regarding potential direct mechanisms of viral action on the circulatory system. Whilst the research and academic value in understanding asymptomatic spread is undisputed, the magnitude of the socioeconomic damage by COVID 19 in redirecting resources away from confirmation of active infection in mildly symptomatic cases and asymptomatic contacts onto exposure numbers, is likely to extend transmission long beyond the period of a few weeks documented in China and Korea into months, extending the impact onto healthcare systems.	0

955	As the world confronts coronavirus disease 2019 , an illness caused by yet another emerging pathogen (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS CoV 2]), obstetric care providers are asking what this means for pregnant women. The global spread has been swift, and many key questions remain. The case fatality rate for persons cared for in the United States and whether asymptomatic persons transmit the virus are examples of questions that need to be answered to inform public health control measures. There are also unanswered questions specific to pregnant women, such as whether pregnant women are more severely affected and whether intrauterine transmission occurs. Although guidelines for pregnant women from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been rapidly developed based on the best available evidence, additional information is critically needed to inform key decisions, such as whether pregnant health care workers should receive special consideration, whether to temporarily separate infected mothers and their newborns, and whether it is safe for infected women to breastfeed. Some current recommendations are well supported, based largely on what we know from seasonal influenza: patients should avoid contact with ill persons, avoid touching their face, cover coughs and sneezes, wash hands frequently, disinfect contaminated surfaces, and stay home when sick. Prenatal clinics should ensure all pregnant women and their visitors are screened for fever and symptoms, and symptomatic women should be isolated from well women and required to wear a mask. As the situation with COVID 19 rapidly unfolds, it is critical that obstetricians keep up to date.	1

957	"The pandemic prevalence of COVID 19 has become a very serious global health issue. Scientists all over the world have been heavily invested in the discovery of a drug to combat SARS CoV 2.
It has been found that RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) plays a crucial role in SARS CoV 2 replication, and thus could be a potential drug target. Here, comprehensive computational approaches including drug repurposing and molecular docking were employed to predict an effective drug candidate targeting RdRp of SARS CoV 2. This study revealed that Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Fidaxomicin, 7 methyl guanosine 5' triphosphate 5' guanosine and Ivermectin have a potential inhibitory interaction with RdRp of SARS CoV 2, and could be effective drugs for COVID 19. In addition, virtual screening of the compounds from ZINC database also allowed the prediction of two compounds (ZINC09128258 and ZINC 09883305) with pharmacophore features that interact effectively with RdRp of SARS CoV 2; indicating their potentiality as effective inhibitors of the enzyme. Furthermore, ADME analysis along with analysis of toxicity was also investigated to check the pharmacokinetics and drug likeness properties of the two compounds.

958	The year 2020 has seen an unprecedented COVID 19 pandemic due to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus in 180 countries. In a desperate effort to discover new drugs and vaccines for COVID 19, many scientists are working around the clock. Their valuable time and effort may benefit from computer based mining of a large volume of health science literature that is a treasure trove of information. In this paper, we have developed a graph based model using abstracts of 10,683 scientific articles to find key information on three topics: transmission, drug types, and genome research related to coronavirus. A subgraph is built for each of the three topics to extract more topic focused information. Within each subgraph, we use a betweenness centrality measurement to rank order the importance of keywords related to drugs, diseases, pathogens, hosts of pathogens, and biomolecules. The results reveal intriguing information about antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Amantadine, Dexamethasone), pathogen hosts (pigs, bats, macaque, cynomolgus), viral pathogens (zika, dengue, malaria, and several viruses in the coronaviridae virus family), and proteins and therapeutic mechanisms (oligonucleotide, interferon, glycoprotein) in connection with the core topic of coronavirus. The categorical summary of these keywords and topics may be a useful reference to expedite and recommend new and alternative directions for COVID 19 research.	1

960	This training is commendable; however, PeDI C identified the need for context specific simulation (ie, simulation that reflects their specific role in the health care team).12,13 For example, anesthesia clinicians should design simulation sessions focused on intubating and extubating COVID 19 patients in full appropriate PPE while minimizing exposure to and spread of the virus in the perioperative environment. A simulation using a 3 layer transparent plastic technique with a simulated cough with particles of similar size to the SARS COV 2 virus indicates that this barrier may trap virus under the plastic drape creating a hot zone around the patient but reducing the exposure of clinicians.27 The World Health Organization (WHO) guide for rational use of PPE encourages the use of “physical barriers to reduce exposure to COVID 19 virus. Protective barriers can be helpful in all phases of care, and the WHO has recommended using them to reduce viral dispersion.35 Supplemental Digital Content 4, Video 3, http://links.lww.com/AA/D87, demonstrates an example of transparent barrier techniques used by PeDI C members during extubation.27 In addition, PeDI C agreed thatclinicians should consider placing a suction device under the barrier to create a negative pressure microenvironment which may scavenge droplets and aerosolized materials.	0

The LR model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.89, and the RF model showed similar performance with sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 1.0 in test dataset.
The machine learning based CT radiomics models showed feasibility and accuracy for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS CoV 2 infection.

Results
A total of 52 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection and initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia, China. As of February 20, 14 patients were still hospitalized, and 7 patients had non findings in CT images. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. The training and inter validation cohort comprised 26 patients (12 from Ankang, 8 from Lishui, 4 from Lanzhou, and 2 from Linxia) with 59 lesion segments, and test cohort comprised 5 patients from Zhenjiang with 13 lesion segments. The median age was 38.00 (interquartile range, 26.00 47.00) years and 17 (57%) were male. Comorbidities, symptoms and laboratory findings at admission were summarized in Table 1 .
The CT radiomics model, based on 6 features (supplementary Table1), showed the highest AUC on the training and inter validation dataset. The performance of modeling using LR and RF methods was shown in Figure 2. On lung lobe level, models using LR method significantly distinguished short and long term hospital stay (In training and inter validation datasets, cut off value 0.31, AUC 0.94 (95%CI 0.92 0.97), sensitivity 1.0, specificity 0.87, NPV 1.0, and PPV 0.88; In test dataset, AUC 0.97 (95%CI 0.83 1.0), sensitivity 1.0, specificity 0.89, NPV 1.0, and PPV 0.8). Besides, models using RF method obtained satisfied results (In training and inter validation datasets, cut off value 0.68, AUC 1.0 (95%CI 1.0 1.0), All rights reserved.

962	There is a nationwide concern about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) and immediate medical emergency caused by the infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2); currently, this virus is the largest global public health threat leading to a major challenge of medical systems in all countries. From the aftermaths from hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico there are rough ASTRO guidelines based on the limited evidence available [73–76].If possible members of the staff at high risk for 19 courses of disease should be identified and, if possible from an organizational point of view, allotted to off site assignments to allow for optimal social distancing and staff protection.	1

The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. Results: Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care.
(Continued on next page) Conclusions: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID 19. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short and long term."	0

Die Tatsache, dass auch Patienten mit hypoxischem Hirnschaden und demenziellem Syndrom langzeitbeatmet werden [5], langzeitbeatmete COPD Patienten eine hohe Lebens Unzufriedenheit haben und etwa die Hälfte der COPD Patienten ihr Bedauern darüber zum Ausdruck bringt, dass sie im Rahmen des Intensivaufenthaltes tracheotomiert worden und nachfolgend langzeitbeatmet sind [6], wirft ethische Fragen auf. Allerdings konnte kürzlich in einer randomisiert kontrollierten Studie gezeigt werden, dass Patienten, die nach stationärer Behandlung aufgrund einer Akutexazerbation eine über zwei Wochen persistierende Hyperkapnie aufweisen, durch die NIV einen prognostischen Benefit hinsichtlich der stationären Wiederaufnahme oder des Versterbens innerhalb von 12 Monaten haben [11].	0
967	This study is based on the a simple but robust model we developed urgently to accurately monitor and predict viral dynamics for each SARS CoV 2 infected patient, given the limited number of to monitor and predict the changes of viral loads from different nasal and throat swab of clinical specimens collected from diagnosed patients. We also tested this real time model by using the data from the SARS CoV 2 infected patients with different severity. By using this model (http://58.87.113.187:8080/), we can predict the viral dynamics of patients, minimize false negative test results, and screen the patients who are at risk of testing positive again after recovery. We sincerely thank those who are on the front lines battling SARS CoV 2 virus. We hope this model will be useful for SARS CoV 2 infected patients.	1

For China and South Korea, who have already flattened their infection curves, the number of infected individuals (I(t)) exhibits power law behavior before flattening of the curve. Italy has transitioned to the power law regime for some time. For the other six nations USA, Spain, Germany, France, Japan, and India a power law regime is beginning to appear after exponential growth. We argue that the transition from an exponential regime to a powerlaw regime may act as an indicator for flattening of the epidemic curve. We also argue that long term community transmission and/or the transmission by asymptomatic carriers traveling long distances may be inducing the power law growth of the epidemic.	1

The steps of the DT centers include registration, examination, specimen collection, and instructions. The entire service takes about 10 minutes for one testee without leaving his or her cars. Increased testing capacity over 100 tests per day and prevention of cross infection between testees in the waiting space are the major advantages, while protection of staff from the outdoor atmosphere is challenging. It could be implemented in other countries to cope with the global COVID 19 outbreak and transformed according to their own situations.

976	"Background Hydroxychloroquine has recently received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA and is currently prescribed in combination with azithromycin for COVID 19 pneumonia. We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin.
Methods New user cohort studies were conducted including 16 severe adverse events (SAEs).
Rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 18  and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared to those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days. Self controlled case series (SCCS) were conducted to further establish safety in wider populations. Separately, SAEs associated with hydroxychloroquineazithromycin (compared to hydroxychloroquine amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, UK, and USA.
Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (CalHRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where I2<40%.
Overall, 956,374 and 310,350 users of hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine, and 323,122 and 351,956 users of hydroxychloroquine azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine amoxicillin were included. No excess risk of SAEs was identified when 30 day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. SCCS confirmed these findings. However, when azithromycin was added to hydroxychloroquine, we observed an increased risk of 30 day cardiovascular mortality (CalHR2.19 [1.22 3.94]), chest pain/angina (CalHR 1.15 [95% CI 1.05 1.26]), and heart failure (CalHR 1.22 [95% CI 1.02 1.45])"	0
977	"Recently a number of publications looked at the association between COVID 19 morbidity and mortality on one hand and countries' policies with respect to BCG vaccination on the other. This connection arises from differences in the rates of infection in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory compared to countries where mandatory vaccination no longer exists or was never implemented in the first place. In at least 2 preprint publications the authors expressed the view that the ""known immunological benefits"" of BCG vaccination may be behind the biological mechanism of such observation. One study accounted for different income levels in different groups. Another study did not attempted to do so, instead exploring the differences between countries where a booster shot is given vs others where no such practice exists (finding no connection). Both of these studies did not explore other potential confounding factors. Meanwhile the press has focused on these headlines and pushed the narrative that BCG vaccination is causally linked to infection and mortality rates. This poses a serious challenge, demonstrated by the recently initiated clinical trials on BCG vaccination within the COVID19 context. This study shows that population age is a very significant confounding factor that explains the rates of infections much better and has a solid biology mechanism which explains this correlation. It suggests that BCG vaccination may have little or no causal link to infection rates and advises that any follow up studies should control for several confounding factors, such as population age, ethnicity, rates of certain chronic diseases, time from community spread start date, major public policy decisions and income levels."	0

980	The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has caused more than 80 813 confirmed cases in all provinces of China, and 21 110 cases reported in 93 countries of six continents as of 7 March 2020 since middle December 2019. Due to biological nature of the novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) with faster spreading and unknown transmission pattern, it makes us in a difficulty position to contain the disease transmission globally. To date, we have found it is one of the greatest challenges to human beings in fighting against COVID 19 in the history, because SARS CoV 2 is different from SARS CoV and MERS CoV in terms of biological features and transmissibility, and also found the containment strategies including the non pharmaceutical public health measures implemented in China are effective and successful. In order to prevent a potential pandemic level outbreak of COVID 19, we, as a community of shared future for mankind, recommend for all international leaders to support preparedness in low and middle income countries especially, take strong global interventions by using old approaches or new tools, mobilize global resources to equip hospital facilities and supplies to protect noisome infections and to provide personal protective tools such as facemask to general population, and quickly initiate research projects on drug and vaccine development. We also recommend for the international community to develop better coordination, cooperation, and strong solidarity in the joint efforts of fighting against COVID 19 spreading recommended by the joint mission report of the WHO China experts, against violating the International Health Regulation (WHO, 2005), and against stigmatization, in order to eventually win the battle against our common enemy  COVID 19.	1

983	In the group testing problem one aims to infer a small set of k infected individuals out of a large population of size n. At our disposal we have a testing scheme which allows us to test a group of individuals, such that the outcome of the test is positive, if and only if at least one infected individual is part of the test. All tests are carried out in parallel. The overall goal is to find a test design and an inference algorithm requiring as few tests as possible, such that the infected individuals can be identified with high probability. As most relevant during the outbreak of pandemic diseases (Wang et al., 2011), our analysis focusses on the so called sublinear regime of group testing, where k ∼ n θ (0 < θ < 1). The optimal group testing schemes require a test size of ∼ n/k and each individual has to take part in ∼ ln n tests . In real world applications, like testing many individuals in a short period of time during the outbreak of epidemics, pooling in such a way is not possible due to dilution effects. Evidence of those effects is known for important applications like HIV (Wein, 1996) or COVID 19 (Seifried and Ciesek, 2020). Our main contribution is the analysis of a group testing model, where we restrict the individuals per test to be finite. We present an easy to implement scheme to pool individuals into tests under these natural restrictions coming with an efficient decoding algorithm DD (Aldridge et al., 2014) and present simulations which suggest that the decoding procedure succeeds for moderate population sizes. Furthermore, we show that our pooling scheme requires the fewest tests as possible under all pooling schemes. Finally, we apply our methods to the finitely many tests per individuals setting, where we provide a full understanding of the random regular test design in this model by building up on work of (Gandikota et al., 2016).	0

Severe acute respiratory syndrome
Timeliness is a critical issue in preventing the spread of emerging/notifiable infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or avian influenza (bird flu).
Current computerized surveillance systems in many countries have demonstrated their usefulness in detecting specified communicable diseases. However, the off line, daily or weekly data reporting mode induces a time lag in data collection, transmission, processing, and responses. This paper proposes an on line real time mechanism, named EDICTS, for emerging/notifiable infectious diseases control, tracking and surveillance. It is based on the on line health IC card system and works at the registration process of primary care practices and emergency departments. Hence, should a disease defined by CDC (Center for disease control) be detected at the registration station, EDICTS responds in real time. Note that EDICTS is a mechanism; it is CDC that determines the policy and activates it. A prototype is designed and implemented on a simulated environment of the Taiwan's national health insurance IC card system. The proposed policy and rules are defined according to the CDC regulations. Timely, sensitive and cost effective, EDICTS complements the existing successive level of CDC reporting system as a fast response control channel."	0

Electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection are broadly reviewed in terms of transduction elements, biorecognition elements, electrochemical techniques, and biosensor performance. Transduction elements are discussed in terms of electrode material and form factor. Biorecognition elements for pathogen detection, including antibodies, aptamers, and imprinted polymers, are discussed in terms of availability, production, and immobilization approach. Emerging areas of electrochemical biosensor design are reviewed, including electrode modification and transducer integration. Measurement formats for pathogen detection are classified in terms of sample preparation and secondary binding steps. Applications of electrochemical biosensors for the detection of pathogens in food and water safety, medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and bio threat applications are highlighted. Future directions and challenges of electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection are discussed, including wearable and conformal biosensors, detection of plant pathogens, multiplexed detection, reusable biosensors for process monitoring applications, and low cost, disposable biosensors.	0

Replacement of the heterologous 5 0 untranslated region allows preservation of the fully functional activities of type 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus a b s t r a c t
The 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) is believed to be vital for the replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), yet its functional mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, to define the cis acting elements for viral replication and infectivity, The 5 0 UTR swapping chimeric clones pTLV8 and pSHSP5 were constructed based on two different genotypes full length infectious cDNA clone pAPRRS and pSHE backbones. Between them, vTLV8 could be rescued from pTLV8 and had similar virological properties to vAPRRS, including phenotypic characteristic and RNA synthesis level. However, pSHSP5 exhibited no evidence of infectivity. Taken together, the results presented here demonstrate that only the 5 0 UTR of type 1 PRRSV did not affect the infectivity and replication of type 2 PRRSV in vitro. The 5 0 UTR of type 2 PRRSV could be functionally replaced by its counterpart from type 1."	0

993	"Background The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same. However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case detection during the COVID 19 outbreak.
We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID 19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents.
likely case detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22 67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18 68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0 42) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence.
Interpretation Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID 19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.

995	The Coronavirus pandemic has taken the world by storm as also the social media. As the awareness about the ailment increased, so did messages, videos and posts acknowledging its presence. The social networking site, Twitter, demonstrated similar effect with the number of posts related to coronavirus showing an unprecedented growth in a very short span of time. This paper presents a statistical analysis of the twitter messages related to this disease posted since January 2020. Two types of empirical studies have been performed. The first is on word frequency and the second on sentiments of the individual tweet messages. Inspection of the word frequency is useful in characterizing the patterns or trends in the words used on the site. This would also reflect on the psychology of the twitter users at this critical juncture. Unigram, bigram and trigram frequencies have been modeled by power law distribution. The results have been validated by Sum of Square Error (SSE), R 2 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). High values of R 2 and low values of SSE and RMSE lay the grounds for the goodness of fit of this model. Sentiment analysis has been conducted to understand the general attitudes of the twitter users at this time. Both tweets by general public and WHO were part of the corpus. The results showed that the majority of the tweets had a positive polarity and only about 15% were negative.	0
996	Respiratory virus infection is one of the major sources of exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. These exacerbations are associated with high morbidity and even mortality worldwide. The current understanding on viral induced exacerbations is that viral infection increases airway inflammation which aggravates disease symptoms. Recent advances in in vitro air liquid interface 3D cultures, organoid cultures and the use of novel human and animal challenge models have evoked new understandings as to the mechanisms of viral exacerbations. In this review, we will focus on recent novel findings that elucidate how respiratory viral infections alter the epithelial barrier in the airways, the upper airway microbial environment, epigenetic modifications including miRNA modulation, and other changes in immune responses throughout the upper and lower airways. First, we reviewed the prevalence of different respiratory viral infections in causing exacerbations in chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Subsequently we also summarized how recent models have expanded our appreciation of the mechanisms of viral induced exacerbations. Further we highlighted the importance of the virome within the airway microbiome environment and its impact on subsequent bacterial infection. This review consolidates the understanding of viral induced exacerbation in chronic airway inflammatory diseases and indicates pathways that may be targeted for more effective management of chronic inflammatory diseases.	0

This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The databases of MEDLINE/PubMed, WHO Virtual Health Library (VHL), and ScienceDirect were used for the systematic search.

A total of 11 studies, with 2437 COVID 19 patients, which fulfilled the eligibility criteria were included in the meta analysis. The analysis revealed that lymphocyte count was significantly lower in patients with the severe form of COVID 19 (SMD =  1.025, P value <.001) . Also, the analysis of SMD showed that patients with severe COVID 19 have a significantly higher serum levels of CRP (SMD = 3.363, P value <.001), D Dimer (SMD = 1.073, P value <.001), and LDH (SMD = 3.345, P value <.001) .

999	Here, in an effort towards facile and fast screening/diagnosis of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19), we combined the unprecedently sensitive graphene fieldeffect transistor (Gr FET) with highly selective antibody antigen interaction to develop a coronavirus immunosensor. The Gr FET immunosensors can rapidly identify (about 2 mins) and accurately capture the COVID 19 spike protein S1 (which contains a receptor binding domain, RBD) at a limit of detection down to 0.2 pM, in a real time and label free manner. Further results ensure that the Gr FET immunosensors can be promisingly applied to screen for high affinity antibodies (with binding constant up to 2×10 11 M  1 against the RBD) at concentrations down to 0.1 pM.

Con el crecimiento de los viajes internacionales y la inmigración, en España ha aumentado el número de pacientes con enfermedades infecciosas importadas, muchas de ellas desde zonas tropicales o subtropicales. Paralelamente también se ha multiplicado el número de publicaciones científicas de autores españoles sobre infecciones importadas causadas por parásitos, hongos, micobacterias, bacterias o virus. El riesgo que representan para la salud pública es bajo, aunque para su correcta prevención y su control es importante facilitar el acceso universal a la asistencia sanitaria y a unas condiciones socioeconómicas dignas, así como mantener una formación clínica y epidemiológica actualizada del personal sanitario. Estas medidas a escala nacional deben compaginarse con las iniciativas internacionales de control global de estas infecciones.

1001	The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the virus SARS CoV 2 is expanding globally. South Korea is one of the countries most affected by COVID 19 from the very early stages of this pandemic. Explosive outbreaks occurred across South Korea in the first two months, and efforts to control this new virus have involved everyone across the country. To curb the transmission of the virus, health care professionals, committees, and governments have combined many approaches, such as extensive COVID 19 screening, effective patient triage, the transparent provision of information, and the use	1

The aim of this study is to explore the impacts of COVID 19 on people's mental health, to assist policy makers to develop actionable policies, and help clinical practitioners (e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) provide timely services to affected populations. We sample and analyze the Weibo posts from 17,865 active Weibo users using the approach of Online Ecological Recognition (OER) based on several machine learning predictive models. We calculated word frequency, scores of emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, indignation, and Oxford happiness) and cognitive indicators (e.g., social risk judgment and life satisfaction) from the collected data. The sentiment analysis and the paired sample t test were performed to examine the differences in the same group before and after the declaration of COVID 19 on 20 January, 2020. The results showed that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression and indignation) and sensitivity to social risks increased, while the scores of positive emotions (e.g., Oxford happiness) and life satisfaction decreased. People were concerned more about their health and family, while less about leisure and friends. The results contribute to the knowledge gaps of short term individual changes in psychological conditions after the outbreak. It may provide references for policy makers to plan and fight against COVID 19 effectively by improving stability of popular feelings and urgently prepare clinical practitioners people.	0

1006	Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) outbreak has become a severe public health issue. The novelty of the virus prompts a search for understanding of how ecological factors affect the transmission and survival of the virus. Several studies have robustly identified a relationship between temperature and the number of cases. However, there is no specific study for a tropical climate such as Brazil. This work aims to determine the relationship of temperature to COVID 19 infection for the state capital cities of Brazil. Cumulative data with the daily number of confirmed cases was collected from February 27 to April 1, 2020, for all 27 state capital cities of Brazil affected by COVID 19. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between annual average temperature compensation and confirmed cases. Also, a polynomial linear regression model was proposed to represent the behavior of the growth curve of COVID 19 in the capital cities of Brazil. The GAM dose response curve suggested a negative linear relationship between temperatures and daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID 19 in the range from 16.8°C to 27.4°C. Each 1°C rise of temperature was associated with a −4.8951% (t = −2.29, p = 0.0226) decrease in the number of daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID 19. A sensitivity analysis assessed the robustness of the results of the model. The predicted R squared of the polynomial linear regression model was 0.81053. In this study, which features the tropical temperatures of Brazil, the variation in annual average temperatures ranged from 16.8°C to 27.4°C. Results indicated that temperatures had a negative linear relationship with the number of confirmed cases. The curve Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f flattened at a threshold of 25.8°C. There is no evidence supporting that the curve declined for temperatures above 25.8°C. The study had the goal of supporting governance for healthcare policymakers. Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f	0

 Hepatic injury is evident in some patients, the degree of which at times can mirror severity of disease; pancreatic injury has been noted as well.
 SARS CoV 2 RNA has been found in fecal samples even after viral RNA in respiratory samples clears, raising concern for gastrointestinal viral replication and potential for fecaloral transmission.
 While no definitive treatment for COVID 19 exists, mainstay remains supportive including oxygen and mechanical ventilation; at this time, gastrointestinal manifestations are largely managed symptomatically as well.
 The potential for fecal oral spread of infectious virions may warrant additional precautions and patient education about proper hand hygiene, social distancing, and understanding the risk for close contacts and re infection.
There is an increasing number of confirmed cases and deaths caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) contributing to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic. At this point, the need for further disease characterization is critical.
COVID 19 is well established as a respiratory tract pathogen; however, recent studies have shown an increasing number of patients reporting gastrointestinal manifestations such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The time from onset of gastrointestinal symptoms to hospital presentation is often delayed compared to that of respiratory symptoms. It has been noted that SARS CoV 2 RNA can be detected in fecal matter for an extended period of time, even after respiratory samples have tested negative and patients are asymptomatic. In this article, SARS CoV 2 and its disease COVID 19 will be reviewed with consideration of the latest literature about gastrointestinal symptomatology, the mechanisms by which the virus may inflict damage, and the possibility of viral replication contributing to a fecal oral route of transmission."	0

1011	However, there were problems in this process during this crisis, as various individuals and organizations began to produce and disseminate information that, given the special circumstances of this crisis (that most countries have rarely experienced), produced types of information that are worth consideration.	1
1012	Understanding disease spread through data visualisation has concentrated on trends and maps. Whilst these are helpful, they neglect important multi dimensional interactions between characteristics of communities. Using the Topological Data Analysis Ball Mapper algorithm we construct an abstract representation of NUTS3 level economic data, overlaying onto it the confirmed cases of Covid 19 in England. In so doing we may understand how the disease spreads on different socio economical dimensions. It have quickly raced to the highest levels of infection, while others close by in the characteristic space, do not show large infection growth. Likewise, we see patterns emerging in very different areas that command more monitoring. A strong contribution for Topological Data Analysis, and the Ball Mapper algorithm especially, in comprehending dynamic epidemic data is signposted.	1
1013	"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is a serious threat to 25 global public health, and imposes severe burdens on the entire human society. The 26 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) can cause 27 severe respiratory illness and death. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs 28 that can treat COVID 19. Several vaccines against SARS CoV 2 are being actively 29 developed by research groups around the world. The surface S (spike) protein and the 30 highly expressed internal N (nucleocapsid) protein of SARS CoV 2 are widely 31 considered as promising candidates for vaccines. In order to guide the design of an 32 effective vaccine, we need experimental data on these potential epitope candidates. In 33 this study, we mapped the immunodominant (ID) sites of S protein using sera samples 34 collected from recently discharged COVID 19 patients. The SARS CoV 2 S protein 35 specific antibody levels in the sera of recovered COVID 19 patients were strongly 36 correlated with the neutralising antibody titres. We used epitope mapping to 37 determine the landscape of ID sites of S protein, which identified nine linearized B 38 cell ID sites. Four out of the nine ID sites were found in the receptor binding domain 39 (RBD). Further analysis showed that these ID sites are potential high affinity SARS 40 CoV 2 antibody binding sites. Peptides containing two out of the nine sites were 41 tested as vaccine candidates against SARS CoV 2 in a mouse model. We detected 42 epitope specific antibodies and SARS CoV 2 neutralising activity in the immunised 43 mice. This study for the first time provides human serological data for the design of 44 vaccines against COVID 19.

1019	In Coronavirus disease 2019 , the initial viral replication phase is often followed by a hyperinflammatory reaction in the lungs and other organ systems ('cytokine storm syndrome') that leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi organ failure, and death despite maximal supportive care. Preventing hyperinflammation is key to avoiding progression to severe stages of COVID 19. We have previously demonstrated that alpha 1 adrenergic receptor ( ⍺ 1  AR) antagonists can prevent cytokine storm syndrome and resulting death in mice. Here, we present a retrospective study of outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress (n = 13,125) or pneumonia (n = 108,956). Patients with acute respiratory distress who were taking ⍺ 1  AR antagonists for other conditions had a 35% reduced risk of requiring ventilation, and a 56% reduced risk of ventilation and death, compared to non users (adjusted OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 0.81, p = 0.01). By contrast, no significant effect was observed for beta adrenergic receptor (β AR) antagonists. These results support studying ⍺ 1  AR antagonists for preventing ARDS and reducing mortality in pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, as well as highlight the need for prospective trials of ⍺ 1  AR antagonists to assess 19.	0

The approach has been tested by predicting the number of contaminated persons until 20 days after fitting the inputs data collected within 15 days using standard least χ 2  fit method. Encouraged by this first test, we add the new data collected within 30 days and give prevision until 33 days. The present data show an approximate linear increase of about (4 5) infected persons per day while the analysis signals an eventual near future stronger growth. These results may also be interpreted as the lowest values of the real cases due to the insufficient number of samples (about 2200 for 20 millions of population). A comparison with some other approaches is done. Some social, economical and political impacts of COVID 19 and confinement for Madagascar and Worldwide are shortly discussed.	1
1023	Confronting the pandemic of COVID 19 caused by the new coronavirus, the SARS CoV 2, is nowadays one of the most prominent challenges of the human species. A key factor in slowing down the virus propagation is the rapid diagnosis and isolation of infected patients. Nevertheless, the standard method for COVID 19 identification, the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) method, is time consuming and in short supply due to the pandemic. Researchers around the world have been looking for alternative screening methods. In this context, deep learning applied to chest X rays of patients has been showing promising results in the identification of COVID 19. Despite their success, the computational cost of these methods remains high, which imposes difficulties in their accessibility and availability. Thus, in this work, we propose to explore and extend the EfficientNet family of models using chest Xrays images to perform COVID 19 detection. As a result, we can produce a high quality model with an overall accuracy of 93.9%, COVID 19, sensitivity of 96.8% and positive prediction of 100% while having about 30 times fewer parameters than the baseline literature model, 28 and 5 times fewer parameters than the popular VGG16 and ResNet50 architectures, respectively. We believe the reported figures represent state of the art results, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, for the COVIDx database, a database comprised of 13,800 X 19.	0

1025	"SARS CoV 2 is known to infect the neurological, respiratory, enteric, and hepatic systems of human and has already become an unprecedented threat to global healthcare system. COVID 19, the most serious public condition caused by SARS CoV 2 leads the world to an uncertainty alongside thousands of regular death scenes. Unavailability of specific therapeutics or approved vaccine has made the recovery of COVI 19 more troublesome and challenging. The present in silico study aimed to predict a novel chimeric vaccines by simultaneously targeting four major structural proteins via the establishment of ancestral relationship among different strains of coronaviruses. Conserved regions from the homologous protein sets of spike glycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein (N) were identified through multiple sequence alignment. The phylogeny analyses of whole genome stated that four proteins (S, E, M and N) reflected the close ancestral relation of SARS CoV 2 to SARS COV 1 and bat coronavirus. Numerous immunogenic epitopes (both T cell and B cell) were generated from the common fragments which were further ranked on the basis of antigenicity, transmembrane topology, conservancy level, toxicity and allergenicity pattern and population coverage analysis.
Top putative epitopes were combined with appropriate adjuvants and linkers to construct a novel multiepitope subunit vaccine against COVID 19. The designed constructs were characterized based on physicochemical properties, allergenicity, antigenicity and solubility which revealed the superiority of construct V3 in terms safety and efficacy. Essential molecular dynamics and Normal Mode analysis confirmed minimal deformability of the refined model at molecular level.
In addition, disulfide engineering was investigated to accelerate the stability of the protein.
Molecular docking study ensured high binding affinity between construct V3 and HLA cells, as well as with different host receptors. Microbial expression and translational efficacy of the constructs were checked using pET28a( ) vector of E. coli strain K12. The development of preventive measures to combat COVID 19 infections might be aided the present study.
However, the in vivo and in vitro validation might be ensured with wet lab trials using model animals for the implementation of the presented data."	0
1026	The COVID 19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is raging across the world, leading to a mortality rate of 3.4%. As a potential vaccine and therapeutic target, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS CoV 2 (nCoVN) functions in packaging the viral genome by lentiviral expression systems. Unexpectedly, the morphology and proliferation rate of iPSC were changed after nCoVN expressing for two weeks. The pluripotency markers SSEA4 and TRA 1 81 were not detectable in iPSC nCoVN. Meanwhile, iPSC nCoVN lost the ability for differentiation into cardiomyocytes when using a routine differentiation protocol. Our data suggested that nCoVN disrupted the pluripotent properties of iPSC and turned them into fibroblasts, which provided a new insight to the pathogenic mechanism of SARS CoV 2.	1

Case presentation: A 34 year old male, returning from Spain, presented with complaints of fever, and cough, and class II obesity, being hospitalized. The respiratory viruses and bacteria tested by FilmArray ® PCR were negative. Two days later, clarithromycin was started because the patient was suspected as community acquired pneumonia. At the third day, the rRT PCR confirmed the SARS CoV 2 infection. A day later, chloroquine was started because of that. His chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with consolidation, which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis. Progressively his clinical condition improved and at day 9, patient rRT PCR for SARS CoV 2 became negative. The patient was discharged and isolated at home per 14 days.
Our patient improved significantly. This and other COVID 19 cases are urgently demanding results from clinical trials that support evidence based therapeutical approaches to this pandemic and the clinical management of patients, especially those at critical care."	1

1036	"Objective: We estimated that how many hospital workers in the United States (US) might get infected or die in the COVID 19 pandemic. We also estimated the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) and age restrictions on these estimates.
: Our secondary analyses estimated hospital worker infections in the US based on health worker infection and death rates per 100 deaths from COVID 19 in Hubei and Italy. We used Monte Carlo simulations to compute point estimates with 95% confidence intervals for hospital worker infections in the US based on the two scenarios. We computed potential decrease in infections if the PPE were available only to those involved in direct care of COVID 19 patients (~ 30%) and if workers aged ≥ 60 years are restricted from patient care. Estimates were adjusted for hospital workers per bed in the US compared to China and Italy. Results: The hospital worker infections per 100 deaths were 108.2 in Hubei and 94.1 in Italy. Based on Hubei scenario, we estimated that about 53,640 US hospital workers (95% CI: 43,160 to 62,251) might get infected from COVID 19. The Italian scenario suggested 53,097 US hospital worker (95% CI: 37,133 to 69,003) might get infected during the pandemic. Availability of PPE to high risk workers could reduce counts to 28,100 (95% CI: 23,048 to 33,242) considering Hubei and to 28,354 (95% CI: 19,829 to 36,848) considering Italy.

1041	Objective: To quantify coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID 19) pneumonia and to explore whether quantitative computer tomography (CT) could be used to assess severity on admission. Materials and methods: From January 17 to February 9, 2020, 38 hospitalized patients with COVID 19 pneumonia were consecutively enrolled in our hospitals. All clinical data and the chest CT on admission were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Firstly, a quantitative method based on multi scale convolutional neural networks was used to assess the infected lung segments and this was compared with the semi quantitative method. Secondly, the quantitative method was tested with laboratory results and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) by correlation analyses. Thirdly, both quantitative and semi quantitative parameters between patients with different PSI were compared. Results: Thirty cases were finally enrolled: 16 (53.33%) of them were male, and the mean age was 48 years old. The interval from onset symptoms to first chest CT scan was 8 days. The proportion of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and the total lesion based on the quantitative method was positively correlated with the semi quantitative CT score (P < 0.001 for all; rs ¼ 0.88, 0.87, 0.90), CRP (P ¼ 0.0278, 0.0168, 0.0078; rs ¼ 0.40, 0.43, 0.48) and ESR (P ¼ 0.0296, 0.0408, 0.0048; rs ¼ 0.46, 0.44, 0.58), respectively, and was negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count (P ¼ 0.0222, 0.0024, 0.0068; rs ¼ À0.42, À0.53, À0.48). There was a positive correlation trend between the proportion of total infection and the pneumonia severity index (P ¼ 0.0994; rs ¼ 0.30) and a tendency that patients with severe COVID 19 pneumonia had higher percentage of consolidation and total infection (P ¼ 0.0903, 0.0989). Conclusions: Quantitative CT may have potential in assessing the severity of COVID 19 pneumonia on admission.	0

1049	There is limited evidence as to how COVID 19 infection fatality rates (IFR) may vary by ethnicity. We combine demographic and health data for ethnic groupings in Aotearoa New Zealand with international data on IFR for different age groups to estimate inequities in IFR by ethnicity. We find that, if age is the dominant factor determining IFR, estimated IFR for Māori is around 50% higher than non Māori. If underlying health conditions are more important than age per se, then estimated IFR for Māori is more than 2.5 times that of New Zealand European, and estimated IFR for Pasifika is almost double that of New Zealand European. IFRs for Māori and Pasifika are likely to be increased above these estimates by racism within the healthcare system and other inequities not reflected in official data. IFR does not account for differences among ethnicities in COVID 19 incidence, which could be higher in Māori and Pasifika as a result of crowded housing and higher intergenerational contact rates. These factors should be included in future disease incidence modelling. The communities at the highest risk will be those with elderly populations, and Māori and Pasifika communities, where the compounded effects of underlying health conditions, socioeconomic disadvantage, and structural racism death.	0
1050	The magnitude of the COVID 19 pandemic underscores the urgency for a safe and effective vaccine. Here we analyzed SARS CoV 2 sequence diversity across 5,700 sequences sampled since December 2019. The Spike protein, which is the target immunogen of most vaccine 5 candidates, showed 93 sites with shared polymorphisms; only one of these mutations was found in more than 1% of currently circulating sequences. The minimal diversity found among SARS CoV 2 sequences can be explained by drift and bottleneck events as the virus spread away from its original epicenter in Wuhan, China. Importantly, there is little evidence that the virus has adapted to its human host since December 2019. Our findings suggest that a single vaccine 10	0

Cities are locked down and civilians are besieged in their own homes, to prevent the spreading of the virus. War related terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics and diseases. Arguably the discourse around the current epidemic will make use of war related metaphors too,not only in public discourse and the media, but also in the tweets written by non experts of mass communication. We hereby present an analysis of the discourse around  Covid 19, based on a corpus of 200k tweets posted on Twitter during
March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first analyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show that the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus treatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal frame used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal frame covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR is the most frequently used, and thus arguably the most conventional one. However, we conclude, this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around many aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line with previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options, or a metaphor menu, may facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the Covid 19 related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in the expression of their feelings, opinions and ideas during the current pandemic."	0

Abstract A worldwide multi scale interplay among a plethora of factors, ranging from micro pathogens and individual or population interactions to macro scale environmental, socio economic and demographic conditions, entails the development of highly sophisticated mathematical models for robust representation of the contagious disease dynamics that would lead to the improvement of current outbreak control strategies and vaccination and prevention policies. Due to the complexity of the underlying interactions, both deterministic and stochastic epidemiological models are built upon incomplete information regarding the infectious network. Hence, rigorous mathematical epidemiology models can be utilized to combat epidemic outbreaks. We introduce a new spatiotemporal approach (SBDiEM) for modeling, forecasting and nowcasting infectious dynamics, particularly in light of recent e¤orts to establish a global surveillance network for combating pandemics with the use of arti…cial intelligence. This model can be adjusted to describe past outbreaks as well as COVID 19. Our novel methodology may have important implications for national health systems, international stakeholders and policy makers."	0
1055	"For the description of a pandemic mathematical models could be interesting. Both for physicians and politicians as a base for decisions to treat the disease. The responsible estimation of parameters is a main issue of mathematical pandemic models. Especially a good choice of β as the number of others that one infected person encounters per unit time (per day) influences the adequateness of the results of the model. For the actual COVID 19 pandemic some aspects of the parameter choice will be discussed. Because of the incompatibility of the data of the Johns Hopkins University [3] to the data of the German Robert Koch Institut we use the COVID 19 data of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [2] (ECDC) as a base for the parameter estimation. Two different mathematical methods for the data analysis will be discussed in this paper and possible sources of trouble will be shown.
As example of the parameter choice serve the data of the USA and the UK. The resulting parameters will be used estimated and used in W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick's SIR model[1]. Strategies for the commencing and ending of social and economic shutdown measures are discussed.
The numerical solution of the ordinary differential equation system of the modified SIR model is being done with a Runge Kutta integration method of fourth order [4] .
At the end the applicability of the SIR model could be shown essentially. Suggestions about appropriate points in time at which to commence with lockdown measures based on the acceleration rate of infections conclude the paper. This paper is an improved sequel of [5] ."	0

Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID 19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts .

Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r 2 >0.6) with the real data. Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high latitude cities with potential outbreak.

We develop both a linear and nonlinear (extended) filter. The methods are applied to a case study of neonatal sepsis and postinfectious hydrocephalus in Africa, using parameters estimated from publicly available data. Our approach is applicable to a broad range of disease dynamics, including both noncommunicable and the inherent nonlinearities of communicable infectious diseases and epidemics such as from COVID 19. * Contributed equally.	1

1064	"Our society is currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge, managing and containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as COVID 19. While China  where the outbreak started  seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays being detected in multiple countries. Much is currently unknown about the natural history of the disease, such as a possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. Nonetheless, authorities have to take action and implement contention measures, even if not everything is known. To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work specifically dozens of cases have been detected. We implemented an SEIR metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data driven stochastic simulations. Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which although not efficacious for disease eradication, would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases.

1066	"Background: Long term care facilities (LTCFs) are particularly vulnerable to nosocomial outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 , with high rates of transmission and mortality. Timely epidemiological surveillance is essential to detect and respond to outbreaks, but testing resources are highly limited in the current pandemic context.
We used an individual based transmission model to simulate COVID 19 spread along interindividual contact networks in the LTCF setting. A range of surveillance strategies were evaluated for their ability to detect simulated outbreaks, assuming limited availability of standard RT PCR tests. Various epidemiological scenarios were considered, including COVID 19 importation from patient transfers or staff members infected in the community.
We estimated a median delay of 7 (95% uncertainty interval: 2 15) days from importation of an asymptomatic COVID 19 infected patient to first presentation of COVID 19 symptoms among any patients or staff, at which point an additional 7 (0 25) individuals were infected but did not (yet) show symptoms. Across a range of scenarios, the reference surveillance strategy (testing individuals with COVID like symptoms with signs of severity) took a median 11 21 days to detect an outbreak. Group testing (pooling specimens from multiple individuals for a single RT PCR test) patients and staff with any COVID like symptoms was both the most timely and efficient strategy, detecting outbreaks up to twice as quickly as the reference, and more quickly than other considered strategies while using fewer tests. Maximizing use of available tests via testing cascades was more effective .

(which was not certified by peer review) and containing the terms (""COVID"" OR ""coronavirus"" OR ""nCoV"" OR ""SARS CoV 2) AND (""long term care"" OR ""LTCF""). We identified 16 articles published in academic journals, mostly outbreak reports and editorials describing a need for improved testing and control measures. Very few of the 179 identified preprints were studies of COVID 19 in long term care. A separate search for the same COVID terms AND (""transmission model"" OR ""mathematical model"" OR ""dynamic model"") returned 29 published articles, including an evaluation of surveillance strategies in airports, and a range of transmission models at the country or community levels, but none specifically tailored to healthcare settings, whether hospitals, LTCFs or otherwise. Among 776 preprints, we identified a large number of studies assessing and projecting COVID 19 burden in hospital systems, but only two transmission models specific to healthcare settings, neither of which addressed long term care settings nor options for epidemiological surveillance. Together, this suggests a lack of research on the unique transmission dynamics and surveillance considerations for COVID 19 in healthcare settings. This gap is further highlighted by extensive study of nosocomial outbreaks of other zoonotic coronaviruses (SARS CoV, MERS CoV).
Our study is among the first to model nosocomial transmission of COVID 19, and highlights an important role for asymptomatic and pre symptomatic transmission, as well as unique challenges for epidemiological surveillance that result from lags between infection and symptom onset. Our study is also among the first to evaluate different surveillance strategies for COVID 19 in the healthcare setting, in the context of optimizing highly limited testing resources. We include group testing, which has recently been proposed as a cost effective strategy for COVID 19 surveillance, but which has been little implemented in practice. Our findings provide an evidence base for how to tailor surveillance to COVID 19's unique epidemiological characteristics, and ultimately how to improve allocation of limited tests in healthcare settings. We conclude with tangible recommendations for decision makers.
LTCFs are uniquely vulnerable to COVID 19 outbreaks, owing to frail and elderly patient populations and limited resources for testing and outbreak response. We show that differences in allocation of limited tests can have important public health consequences. Improving outbreak detection (e.g. by group testing and/or expanding testing criteria) allows outbreaks to be detected sooner, facilitating timely interventions such as patient isolation, enhanced infection prevention measures and contact tracing. Delaying these responses by a matter of days could make the difference between isolated cases and fullblown nosocomial outbreaks. As the COVID 19 pandemic continues to unfold, improving outbreak detection with the limited resources available remains a central priority for healthcare institutions worldwide."	0

1070	"The goal of this study is to establish a general framework for predicting the so called critical ""Turning Period"" in an infectious disease epidemic such as the COVID 19 outbreak in China early this year. This framework enabled a timely prediction of the turning period when applied to Wuhan COVID 19 epidemic and informed the relevant authority for taking appropriate and timely actions to control the epidemic. It is expected to provide insightful information on turning period for the world's current battle against the COVID 19 pandemic.
The underlying mathematical model in our framework is the individual Susceptible Exposed Infective Removed (iSEIR) model, which is a set of differential equations extending the classic SEIR model. We used the observed daily cases of COVID 19 in Wuhan from February 6 to 10, 2020 as the input to the iSEIR model and were able to generate the trajectory of COVID 19 cases dynamics for the following days at midnight of February 10 based on the updated model, from which we predicted that the turning period of CIVID 19 outbreak in Wuhan would arrive within one week after February 14. This prediction turned to be timely and accurate, providing adequate time for the government, hospitals, essential industry sectors and services to meet peak demands and to prepare aftermath planning.

1072	The very first case of corona virus illness was recorded on 30 January 2020, in India and the number of infected cases, including the death toll, continues to rise. In this paper, we present short term forecasts of COVID 19 for 28 Indian states and five union territories using realtime data from 30 January to 21 April 2020. Applying Holt's second order exponential smoothing method and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, we generate 10 day ahead forecasts of the likely number of infected cases and deaths in India for 22 April to 1 May 2020. Our results show that the number of cumulative cases in India will rise to 36335.63 [PI 95% (30884.56, 42918.87)], concurrently the number of deaths may increase to 1099.38 [PI 95% (959.77, 1553.76)] by 1 May 2020. Further, we have divided the country into severity zones based on the cumulative cases. According to this analysis, Maharashtra is likely to be the most affected states with around 9787.24 [PI 95% (6949.81, 13757.06)] cumulative cases by 1 May 2020.

Here, we present the Donut PCR platform that features high multiplexing, rapid turnaround times, single nucleotide discrimination, and precise quantitation of DNA targets in a portable, affordable, and battery powered instrument using closed consumables that minimize contamination. We built a bread board instrument prototype and three assays/chips to demonstrate the capabilities of Donut PCR: (1) a 9 plex mammal identification panel, (2) a 15 plex bacterial identification panel, and (3) a 30 plex human SNP genotyping assay. The limit of detection of the platform is under 10 genomic copies in under 30 minutes, and the quantitative dynamic range is at least 4 logs. We envision that this platform would be useful for a variety of applications where rapid and care.	0

1081	"Background and purpose: The worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 greatly challenges public medical systems. With limited medical resources, the treatment priority is determined by the severity of patients. However, many mild outpatients quickly deteriorate into severe/critical stage. It is crucial to early identify them and give timely treatment for optimizing treatment strategy and reducing mortality. This study aims to establish an AI model to predict mild patients with potential malignant progression.
Methods: A total of 133 consecutively mild COVID 19 patients at admission who was hospitalized in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 3 to February 13, 2020, were selected in this retrospective IRB approved study. All mild patients were categorized into groups with or without malignant progression. The clinical and laboratory data at admission, the first CT, and the follow up CT at the severe/critical stage of the two groups were compared. Both multivariate logistic regression and deep learning based methods were used to build the prediction models, with their area under ROC curves (AUC) compared.
: Multivariate logistic regression depicted 6 risk factors for malignant progression: age >55years (OR 5.334, 95%CI 1.8 15.803), comorbid with hypertension (OR 5.093, 95%CI 1.236 20.986), a decrease of albumin (OR 4.01, 95%CI 1.216 13.223), a decrease of lymphocyte (OR 3.459, 95%CI 1.067 11.209), the progressive consolidation from CT1 to CTsevere (OR 1.235, 95%CI 1.018 1.498), and elevated HCRP (OR 1.015, 95%CI 1.002 1.029); and one protective factor: the presence of fibrosis at CT1 (OR 0.656, 95%CI 0.473 0.91). By combining the clinical data and the temporal information of the CT data, our deep learning based models achieved the best AUC of 0.954, which outperformed logistic regression (AUC: 0.893),
Conclusions: Our deep learning based methods can identify the mild patients who are easy to deteriorate into severe/critical cases efficiently and accurately, which undoubtedly helps to optimize the treatment strategy, reduce mortality, and relieve the medical pressure.

1085	The real number of people who were truly infected with SARS CoV 2, is certainly significantly larger than the official record. Few countries have tracking and testing procedures that are sufficiently robust to discover nearly all infections. In most countries they are inadequate, hence the true extent of the pandemic is unknown. The current study proposes the estimate of the COVID 19 extent for countries with sufficiently high number of deaths and cases. The estimate is based on a simple model of mortality. This model was developed for a reference country with a large number of cases and high intensity of COVID 19 testing. The model is then applied to compute apparent mortality in the target and reference countries. The number of cases in the target country is then estimated assuming constant underlying true mortality. The estimate of cases in most countries is significantly higher than the official record. As of April 12, 2020, the global estimate is 5.2 million compared to 1.8 million in the official record. The models developed in this study are available at covidmodel.net. The model ignores several factors that are known to influence mortality, such as the demographics and health condition of population, state of epidemic and sociological differences between countries. While the model is rough, it nevertheless provides a unified approach to producing a systematic global estimate of the extent of the COVID 19 epidemic and can be useful for its monitoring.	0

1087	Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) started spreading in Japan. Therefore, the number of patients with severe COVID 19 requiring extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) is expected to increase. A working group has been formed to provide telephone consultation services for cases with severe respiratory failure caused by COVID 19 in Japan. During the first 13 days of the service, there were 12 consultations. For each consultation, we advised the patient on the initiation of ECMO and arranged transportation for patients with ECMO. Based on experience from the H1N1 influenza pandemic, transporting patients to experienced facilities is essential to obtain better outcomes.	1

Herein, SARS CoV 2 RBD with gram level were obtained through Chinese hamster ovary cells high density fermentation. The binding of RBD to SARS CoV 2 receptor, human ACE2, was verified and the efficacy of RBD in vivo was tested on mice and then on horses. As a result, RBD triggered high titer neutralizing antibodies in vivo, and immunoglobulin fragment F(ab')2 was prepared from horse antisera through removing Fc. Neutralization test demonstrated that RBD specific F(ab')2 inhibited SARS CoV 2 with EC50 at 0.07 μg/ml, showing a potent inhibitory effect on SARS CoV 2. These results highlights as RBD specific F(ab')2 as therapeutic candidate for SARS CoV 2.	1
1090	Countries have adopted disparate policies in tackling the COVID 19 coronavirus pandemic. For example, South Korea started a vigorous campaign to suppress the virus by testing patients with respiratory symptoms and tracing and isolating all their contacts, and many European countries are trying to slow down the spread of the virus with varying degrees of shutdowns. There is clearly a need for a model that can realistically simulate different policy actions and their impacts on the disease and health care capacity in a country or a region. Specifically, there is a need to identify destructive policies , i.e. policies that are, based on scientific knowledge, worse than an alternative and should not be implemented. Methods. We developed an agent based model (REINA) using Python and accelerated it by the Cython optimising static compiler. It follows a population over time at individual level at different stages of the disease and estimates the number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care. It estimates death rates and counts based on the treatment available. Any number of interventions can be added on the timeline from a selection including e.g. physical isolation, testing and tracing, and controlling the amount of cases entering the area. The model has open source code and runs online. Results. The model uses the demographics of the Helsinki University Hospital region (1.6 million inhabitants). A mitigation strategy aims to slow down the spread of the epidemic to maintain the hospital capacity by implementing mobility restrictions. A suppression strategy initially consists of the same restrictions but also aggressive testing, tracing, and isolating all coronavirus positive patients and their contacts. The modelling starting point is 2020 02 18. The strategies follow the actual situation until 2020 04 06 and then diverge. The default mitigation scenario with 08	0

1092	"2020 has become the year of coping with COVID 19. This year was to be the ""super year"" for sustainability, a year of strengthening global actions to accelerate the transformations required for achieving the 2030 agenda. We argue that 2020 can and must be a year of both. Thus we call for more utilisation of the health emergency disaster risk management (Health EDRM) framework to complement current responses to COVID 19 and the patent risk of similar phenomena in the future. To make our case, we examine current responses to COVID 19 and their implications for the SFDRR. We argue that current mechanisms and strategies for disaster resilience, as outlined in the SFDRR, can enhance responses to epidemics or global pandemics such as COVID 19. In this regard, we make several general and DRRspecific recommendations. These recommendations concern knowledge and science provision in understanding disaster and health related emergency risks, the extension of disaster risk governance to manage both disaster risks and potential health emergencies, particularly for humanitarian coordination aspects; and the strengthening of communitylevel preparedness and response."	0
1093	Introduction: COVID 19 may predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation and diffuse intravascular coagulation. Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available. Methods: We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID 19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital. Results: We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID 19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13%), 22 were discharged alive (12%) and 139 (76%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31% (95%CI 20 41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27% (95%CI 17 37%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% (95%CI 0 8.2%). PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81%). Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05/per year, 95%CI 1.004 1.01) and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time > 3 s or activated partial thromboplastin time > 5 s (aHR 4.1, 95%CI 1.9 9.1), were independent predictors of thrombotic complications. Conclusion: The 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID 19 infections is remarkably high. Our findings reinforce the recommendation to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all COVID 19 patients admitted to the ICU, and are strongly suggestive of increasing the prophylaxis towards high prophylactic doses, even in the absence of randomized evidence.	0
1094	The basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a naïve, uninfected population. It is well known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019 nCoV need to be revised. By using time dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th , 2020 and re estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.	0

The standard of reference for confirming COVID 19 relies on microbiological tests but these tests might not be available in an emergency setting and their results are not immediately available, contrary to CT. In addition to its role for early diagnosis, CT has a prognostic role by allowing visually evaluating the extent of COVID 19 lung abnormalities 4, 5 . The objective of this study is to address prediction of short term outcomes, especially need for mechanical ventilation. In this multi centric study, we propose an end to end artificial intelligence solution for automatic quantification and prognosis assessment by combining automatic CT delineation of lung disease meeting expert's performance and data driven identification of biomarkers for its prognosis. AI driven combination of variables with CT based biomarkers offers perspectives for optimal patient management .	0
1097	"The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) has quickly evolved into a global health crisis. The transmission potential of 2019 nCoV has been modelled and studied in several recent research works. The key factors such as the basic reproductive number, R0, of the virus have been identified by fitting contagious disease spreading models to aggregated data. The data include the reported cases both within China and in closely connected cities over the world.
In this paper, we study the transmission potential of 2019 nCoV from the perspective of the robustness of the statistical estimation, in light of varying data quality and timeliness in the initial stage of the outbreak. Sample consensus algorithm has been adopted to improve model fitting when outliers are present.
The robust estimation enables us to identify two clusters of transmission models, both are of substantial concern, one with R0 : 8 ∼ 14, comparable to that of measles and the other dictates a large initial infected group.
• We introduce robust transmission model fitting. We employed random sample consensus algorithm for the fitting of a susceptible exposed infectious recovered (SEIR) infection model. • We identify data consistency issues and raise flags for i) a potentially high infectious epidemic and ii) further investigation of records with unexplained statistical characteristics. • This analysis accounts for the spreading in 80  China cities with multi million individual populations, which are connected to the original outbreak location (Wuhan) during the massive people transportation period (chunyun) 1 . • As the virus is active and the analytics and control of the epidemic is an urgent endeavour, we choose to release all source code and implementation details despite the research is on going. The scientific ramification is that conclusions may need further revision with richer and better prepared data made available.
We have published our implementation on Github https://www.github.com/junjy007/ransac_seir. All procedures are included in a single Python notebook. • We have only used publicly available data in the research, which have been also made available with the project.
 Traffic is considered in [8] , but for the purpose of modelling the population variation within Wuhan, the outbreak site.
The quality and reliability of estimation could be further improved by adopting richer data from commercial sources or authorities. More discussion in this regard can be found in the conclusion section."	0

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is a pandemic that has affected more than 1.8 million people worldwide, overwhelmed health care systems due to the high proportion of critical presentations, and resulted in over 100,000 deaths. Since the first data analyses in China, elevated cardiac troponin has been noted in a substantial proportion of patients, implicating myocardial injury as a possible pathogenic mechanism contributing to severe illness and mortality. Accordingly, high troponin levels are associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID 19. This brief review explores the available evidence regarding the association between COVID 19 and myocardial injury."	1
1100	COVID 19 data from India is compared against several countries as well as key states in the US with a major outbreak, and it is found that the basic reproduction number R 0 for India is in the expected range of 1.4 3.9. Further, the rate of growth of infections in India is very close to that in Washington and California. Exponential and classic susceptible infected recovered (SIR) models based on available data are used to make short and long term predictions on a daily basis. Based on the SIR model, it is estimated that India will enter equilibrium by the end of May 2020 with the final epidemic size of approximately 13,000. However, this estimation will be invalid if India enters the stage of community transmission. The impact of social distancing, again with the assumption of no community transmission, is also assessed by comparing data from different geographical locations.	0

1107	Chest X ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID 19 disease. Due to the high availability of large scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural networks (CNN s) for image recognition and classification. However, due to the limited availability of annotated medical images, the classification of medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical diagnosis. Thanks to transfer learning, an effective mechanism that can provide a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to domain specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and adapt our previously developed CNN, called Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC ), for the classification of COVID 19 chest X ray images. DeTraC can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a class decomposition mechanism. The experimental results showed the capability of DeTraC in the detection of COVID 19 cases from a comprehensive image dataset collected from several hospitals around the world. High accuracy of 95.12% (with a sensitivity of 97.91%, a specificity of 91.87%, and a precision of 93.36%) was achieved by DeTraC in the detection of COVID 19 X ray images from normal, and severe acute respiratory syndrome cases. 12 disease within computed tomography (CT ).

France : dectection, alert, response SUMMARY The French public health institute is responsible for promoting and coordinating threats the detection and assessment of health risks, and for suggesting possible responses. Transmissible diseases affecting both human and animal health are the focus of surveillance networks. Early detection of potential infectious threats is based on the screening of '' alert signals '' identified through routine surveillance networks and other systems. The quality and accuracy of these signals is first verified, before assessing, through a multidisciplinary approach, the risk of introduction and dissemination. This article examines specific cases illustrating the process of detection, risk analysis and response, with respect to infectious threats that are endemic in tropical regions and have the potential to be imported into metropolitan France. For both novel pathogens and exotic diseases  which, not being endemic in France, are less well known  the analysis and response process must regularly be adapted to the latest epidemiological, clinical and biological findings, taking interactions between the pathogen, host, and environment into consideration. The need to improve reaction times and risk assessment is also discussed."	0

The virtual community was constructed following the susceptible latent infectious recovered framework. The epidemiological and economic parameters derived from the previous literature and field investigation.
The main outcomes included avoided infectors, cost effectiveness ratios (CERs), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess uncertainty.
In scenario I and II, the isolation and quarantine averted 1696 and 1990 humans infected respectively at the cost of US$12 428 and US$58 555, both with negative value of ICERs. The joint strategy of personal protection and isolation and quarantine could avert one more case than single isolation and quarantine with additional cost of US$166 871 and US$180 140
respectively. The effectiveness of isolation and quarantine decreased as lowering quarantine probability and increasing delay time. Especially in scenario II, when the quarantine probability was less than 25%, the number of infections raised sharply;
when the quarantine delay time reached six days, more than a quarter of individuals would be infected in the community. The strategy including community containment could protect more lives and was cost effective, when the number of imported cases was no less than 65, or the delay time of quarantine was more than five days, or the quarantine probability was below 25%, based on current assumptions.
The isolation and quarantine was the most cost effective intervention.
However, personal protection and isolation and quarantine was the optimal strategy . CC BY NC ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID 19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID 19 early and reduce their mortality.
The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments included chest X ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID 19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data.
The mean age of the dead was 71.48 ± 12.42 years, the average course of the disease was 10.56 ± 4.42 days, all patients eventually died of respiratory failure. All of those who died had underlying diseases, the most common of which was hypertension (16/25, 64%), followed by diabetes (10/25, 40%), heart diseases (8/25, 32%), kidney diseases (5/25, 20%), cerebral infarction (4/25, 16%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 2/25, 8%), malignant tumors (2/25, 8%) and acute pancreatitis (1/25, 4%). The most common organ damage outside the lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver. In the patients' last examination before death, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were elevated in 17 patients (17/25, 68%) and 18 patients (18/25, 72%), lymphocyte counts were decreased in 22 patients (22/25, 88%). Most patients' PCT, CRP and SAA levels were elevated, the percentages were 90.5% (19/21), 85% (19/20) and 100% (21/21) respectively. The levels of the last test of neutrophils (15/16, 93.8%), PCT (11/11, 100%), CRP (11/13, 84.6%), cTnI (8/9, 88.9%), D Dimer (11/12, 91.6%) and LDH (9/9, 100%) were increased as compared to the first test, while the levels of lymphocytes were decreased (14/16, 87.5%).

1118	We study the dynamics of epidemics in a networked metapopulation model. In each subpopulation, representing a locality, disease propagates according to a modified susceptible exposedinfected recovered (SEIR) dynamics. We assume that individuals reduce their number of contacts as a function of the weighted sum of cumulative number of cases within the locality and in neighboring localities. The susceptible and exposed (pre symptomatic and infectious) individuals are allowed to travel between localities undetected. To investigate the combined effects of mobility and contact reduction on disease progression within interconnected localities, we consider a scenario with two localities where disease originates in one and is exported to the neighboring locality via travel of undetected pre symptomatic individuals. We associate the behavior change at the disease importing locality due to the outbreak size at the origin with the level of preparedness of the locality. Our results show that restricting mobility is valuable if the importing locality is increasing its level of preparedness with respect to the outbreak size at the origin. Moreover, increased levels of preparedness can yield lower total outbreak size by further reducing the outbreak size at the importing locality, even when the response at the origin is weak. Our results highlight that public health decisions on social distancing at localities with less severe outbreaks should strongly account for potential impact of neighbouring localities with a poor response to the outbreak rather than localities with successful responses.	0

1124	"The WHO has declared SARS CoV 2 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. However, to date, there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses to SARS CoV 2 infection. In this study, we collected blood from COVID 19 patients who have recently become virus free and therefore were discharged, and analyzed their SARS CoV 2 specific antibody and T cell responses. We observed SARS CoV 2 specific humoral and cellular immunity in the patients. Both were detected in newly discharged patients, suggesting both participate in immune mediated protection to viral infection. However, follow up patients (2 weeks post discharge) exhibited high titers of IgG antibodies, but with low levels of virus specific T cells, suggesting that they may enter a quiescent state. Our work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to SARS CoV 2, and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID 19, especially in the severe cases. It has also implications in designing an effective vaccine to protect and treat SARS CoV 2 infection. : medRxiv preprint

1125	"Background. More than one million infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS CoV 2) have been confirmed. While PCR based assays are used for diagnosis, high through put serologic methods are needed to detect antibodies for seroserveillance and for identification of seroconversion, potential plasma donors, and the nature of the immune response to this pathogen.
A Luminex binding assay was used to assess the presence of antibodies in human sera from COVID 19 infected and  uninfected individuals specific for two recombinant proteins of SARS CoV 2.
Findings. Fluorochrome labeled beads were coated with a recombinant soluble stabilized trimeric SARS CoV 2 S protein ectodomain or its central portion, the receptor binding domain (RBD). Coated beads were incubated with sera, followed by incubation with biotinylated anti human total Ig antibodies and phycoerythrin (PE) labeled streptavidin. Readout using a Luminex analyzer clearly differentiated between sera of the infected and uninfected subjects, delineating a wide range of serum antibody levels in infected subjects.
Interpretation. Antibody assays of sera can identify individuals who are infected with SARS CoV 2 and have seroconverted, as well as subjects who have been infected and recovered. The use of the Luminex binding Ab assay has the advantage that it can be run in approximately 2.5 hours, uses very little antigen, and permits a high through put of samples/day.

1128	"The relentless advance of the SARS CoV 2 virus pandemic has resulted in a significant burden on countries, regardless of their socio economic conditions. The virus has infected more than 2.5 million people worldwide, causing to date more than 150,000 deaths in over 210 countries.
The aim of this study was to describe the trends in cases, tests and deaths related to novel coronavirus disease in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries.
Data were retrieved from the WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID 2019) situation reports and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) databases from Johns Hopkins University. Descriptive statistics including death rates, cumulative mortality and incidence rates, as well as testing rates per population at risk were performed. A comparison analysis among countries with ≥50 confirmed cases was performed from February 26 th , 2020 to April 8 th , 2020.
Brazil had the greatest number of cases and deaths in the region. Panama experienced a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases with Trinidad and Tobago, Bolivia and Honduras having the highest case fatality rates. Panama and Chile conducted more tests per million inhabitants and more tests per day per million inhabitants, followed by Uruguay and El Salvador. Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Ecuador and Brazil had the highest positive test rates.
The COVID 19 disease pandemic caused by the SARS CoV 2 virus has progressed rapidly in LAC countries. Some countries have been affected more severely than others, with some adopting similar disease control methods to help slow down the spread of the virus. With limited testing and other resources, social distancing is needed to help alleviate the strain on already stretched health systems."	0

1130	"The Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine provides protection against tuberculosis (TB), and is proposed to provide protection to non TB infectious diseases. The COVID 19 outbreak results from infection with the novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 (CoV 2) and was declared a pandemic on March 11 th , 2020. We queried whether the BCG vaccine offers protection against CoV 2 infection. We observed that countries with a current universal BCG vaccination policy have a significantly lower COVID 19 incidence than countries which never had a universal BCG policy or had one in the past. However, population density, median age, TB incidence, urban population, and, most significantly, CoV 2 testing rate, were also connected with BCG policy and could potentially confound the analysis. By limiting the analysis to countries with high CoV 2 testing rates, defined as greater than 2,500 tests per million inhabitants, these parameters were no longer statistically associated with BCG policy. When analyzing only countries with high testing rates, there was no longer a significant association between the number of COVID 19 cases per million inhabitants and the BCG vaccination policy. Although preliminary, our analyses indicate that the BCG vaccination may not offer protection against CoV 2 infection. While reporting biases may confound our observations, our findings support exercising caution in determining potential correlation between BCG vaccination and COVID 19 incidence, in part due significantly lower rates of CoV 2 testing per million inhabitants in countries with current universal BCG vaccination policy.

1131	The seventh novel human infecting Betacoronavirus that causes pneumonia (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019 nCoV) originated in Wuhan, China. The evolutionary relationship between 2019 nCoV and the other human respiratory illness causing coronavirus is not closely related. We sought to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019 nCoV with other species of Orthocoronavirinae. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the genome sequences. A cluster tree was developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019 nCoV proteins. The combined data were used to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019 nCoV to other species of Orthocoronavirinae. Our analysis reliably suggests that 2019 nCoV is most closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 and belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus, together with SARS coronavirus and Bat SARS like coronavirus. The phylogenetic profiling cluster of homolog proteins of one annotated 2019 nCoV protein against other genome sequences revealed two clades of ten 2019 nCoV proteins. Clade 1 consisted of a group of conserved proteins in Orthocoronavirinae comprising Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein. Clade 2 comprised six proteins exclusive to Sarbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Two of six Clade 2 nonstructural proteins, NS7b and NS8, were exclusively conserved among 2019 nCoV, BetaCoV_RaTG, and BatSARS like Cov. NS7b and NS8 have previously been shown to affect immune response signaling in the SARS CoV experimental model. Thus, we speculated that knowledge of the functional changes in the NS7b and NS8 proteins during evolution may provide important information to explore the human infective property of 2019 nCoV.	0

1133	The late 2019 Covid 19 disease outbreak has put the health systems of many countries to the limit of their capacity. The most affected European countries are, so far, Italy and Spain. In both countries (and others), the authorities decreed a lockdown, with local specificities. The objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of the measures undertaken in Spain to deal with the pandemic. Method: We estimated the number of cases and the impact of lockdown on the reproducibility number based on the hospitalization reports. Results: The estimated number of cases shows a sharp increase until the lockdown, followed by a slowing down and then a decrease after full quarantine was implemented. Differences in the basic reproduction ratio are also very significant, dropping from de 5.89 (95% CI: 5.46 7.09) before the lockdown to 0.48 (95% CI: 0.15 1.17) afterwards. Conclusions: Handling a pandemic like Covid 19 is very complex and requires quick decision making. The large differences found in the speed of propagation of the disease show us that being able to implement interventions at the earliest stage is crucial to minimise the impact of a potential infectious threat. Our work also stresses the importance of reliable up to date epidemiological data in order outbreak.	0

1135	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS COV 2), previously known as 2019 nCoV, is responsible for the atypical pneumonia pandemic designated as Coronavirus Disease 2019 . The number of cases continues to grow exponentially reaching 492,000 people in 175 countries as of March 25, 2020. 22,169 people (~4.5%) infected with SARS COV 2 virus have died. We have developed an exponential regression model using the COVID 19 case data (Jan 22  Mar 22, 2020). Our primary model uses designated Phase 1 countries, who exceed 2500 cases on Mar 22. The model is then applied to Phase 2 countries: those that escaped the initial Phase 1 global expansion of COVID 19. With the exception of stabilizing countries (South Korea, Japan, and Iran) all Phase 1 countries are growing exponentially, as per 2500 ( ) = 120.4 × 0.238 , with a rate, r = 0.238 ± 0.068. Excluding China, the BRICS developing nations and Australia are in Phase 2. Case data from Phase 2 countries are following the model derived from Phase 1 countries. In the absence of measures employed to flatten the curve including social distancing, quarantine, and healthcare expansion, our model projects over 274,000 cases and 12,300 deaths in the US by Mar 31.

1136	"The recent reclassification of the Riboviria, and the introduction of multiple new taxonomic 10 categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, 11
subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to 12 designate specific viral lineages. While the newly defined subgenera provide much needed 13 standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been 14 proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are 15 divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation 16 of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the 17 most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular 18 epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus 19 sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our 20 phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome scale analyses based on designated 21 holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters 22 between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate 23 sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus 24
propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of 25 subgenus level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, ""MyCoV"", which provides a 26 method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution. 27 author/funder.

1145	"Background As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID 19 from news media and social networks.
In this population level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health care oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID 19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID 19 and daily province level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID 19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID 19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time.
Findings We collected data for 507 patients with COVID 19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35 60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0·0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5·2%) of 9826 patients with COVID 19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020.
Interpretation News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID 19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID 19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions."	0

1147	" Daily cumulative index (DCI) was defined as the average daily number of new cases of COVID 19 and calculated by cumulative cases/number of days between the first reported case and March 6, 2020 by country.  DCI was positively correlated with incidence (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.01, 95% [confidence interval, CI] = 1.00 1.02, p < 0.01).  Higher correlation between mortality and DCI (mortality rate: r = 0.397, p = 0.018; mortality per 1,000,000 people: r = 0.0.428, p = 0.004) was observed than disease incidence.  Reducing DCI through strict infection control measures can help slow the increasing number of COVID 19 cases and further improve outcome in COVID 19 patients.
In addition to the absolute case number, a rapid increase in the number of COVID 19 cases within a short time was supposed to result in insufficiency of the healthcare system and further negatively affect patients' outcomes. This study was conducted to investigate the association between the outcomes of COVID 19 patients and daily cumulative index (DCI), which was defined as the average daily number of new cases of COVID 19 and calculated by cumulative cases/number of days between the first reported case and March 6, 2020 by country. Spearman's rank correlation analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between mortality, incidence, and DCI. In this study, we found that DCI was positively correlated with incidence (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.01, 95% [confidence interval, CI] = 1.00 1.02, p < 0.01). Higher correlation between mortality and DCI (mortality rate: r = 0.397, p = 0.018; mortality per 1,000,000 people: r = 0.0.428, p = 0.004) was observed than disease incidence.
DCI remained statistically associated with mortality per 1,000,000 people after adjustment of Health Care Index (aRR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01 1.03, p < 0.001) or
Healthcare Access and Quality Index (aRR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01 1.04, p < 0.01.

1153	Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) is a new human coronavirus which is spreading with epidemic features in China and other Asian countries; cases have also been reported worldwide. This novel coronavirus disease (COVID 19) is associated with a respiratory illness that may lead to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID 19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which to date are not completely understood. Aims: To provide a review of the differences in pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features of COVID 19, SARS and MERS. Sources: The most recent literature in the English language regarding COVID 19 has been reviewed, and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and MERS epidemics. Content: COVID 19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features. However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and much lower than that of MERS (34.4%). The possibility cannot be excluded that because of the less severe clinical picture of COVID 19 it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS. The actual basic reproductive number (R 0 ) of COVID 19 (2.0e2.5) is still controversial. It is probably slightly higher than the R 0 of SARS (1.7e1.9) and higher than that of MERS (<1). A gastrointestinal route of transmission for SARS CoV 2, which has been assumed for SARS CoV and MERS CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs further investigation. Implications: There is still much more to know about COVID 19, especially as concerns mortality and its capacity to spread on a pandemic level. Nonetheless, all of the lessons we learned in the past from the SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons with which to face this new global threat. N.

1154	"Estudiamos el modelo epidemiológico SIR, con tasa de contagio variable, aplicado a la evolución del COVID 19 en Cuba. Se resalta que un aumento de carácter predictivo de este modelo depende de la comprensión de la dinámica que determina la evolución temporal de la tasa de contagio β * . Se formula un modelo semi empírico para dicha dinámica; donde alcanzar β * ≈ 0 debido al aislamiento se logra después del tiempo de duración media de la enfermedad τ = 1/γ, en que ha decrecido el número de infectados en las familias confinadas.
Se considera que β * (t) debe tener una disminución brusca en el día de inicio del confinamiento y reducirse hasta anularse al final del intervalo τ . El análisis logra describir apropiadamente la curva de infección de Alemania. El mismo modelo se aplica a predecir una curva de infección para Cuba, el cual estima un máximo de infectados que depende de cuan riguroso resulta el aislamiento y que su valor podría ir de 1,000 a 2,000 casos si este ocurre a mediados de mayo 2020. Esto es sugerido por la curva de la razón entre los casos detectados diariamente y el total. Se considera la razón k entre el número de infectados observados y el número total de infectados menor que la unidad. El reducido valor de k disminuye los valores máximos obtenidos cuando β * −γ > 0. En la región lineal con k constante la evolución de los infectados y recuperados observados es independiente de k. Se estudia también el valor de β * a pedazos, por intervalos de tiempo, ajustando a los datos de Cuba, Alemania y Corea del Sur. En este esquema se compara la extrapolación de la evolución de Cuba con tasa de contagio al día 16.04.20 con la obtenida suponiendo a finales de abril una cuarentena estricta. La evolución de este SIR con tasa variable describe correctamente las curvas de evolución de infectados.
Enfatizamos que el máximo deseado de la curva de infectados del SIR no es el máximo estándard con β * constante, sino uno logrado debido a la cuarentena cuando localmente se lograR 0 = β * /γ < 1. Para todos los países que han salido de la epidemia estos máximos se encuentran en la región en que las ecuaciones SIR son lineales. * nana@fisica.ugto.mx † cabo@icimaf.cu Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel"	0

We prospectively collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data on critically ill adults with laboratory confirmed COVID 19 admitted to two hospitals in northern Manhattan between March 2 nd and April 1 st , 2020. The primary outcome was in hospital mortality.
Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to clinical deterioration following hospital admission. The relationship between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and inhospital mortality was modeled using Cox proportional hazards regression. Each patient had at least 14 days of observation.
Of 1,150 adults hospitalized with COVID 19 during the study period, 257 (22%) were critically ill. The median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR] 51 72); 170 (66%) were male. Two hundred twelve (82%) had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (63%; 162/257) and diabetes mellitus (36%; 92/257). One hundred thirtyeight patients (54%) were obese, and 13 (5%) were healthcare workers. As of April 14 th , 2020, in hospital mortality was 33% (86/257); 47% (122/257) of patients remained hospitalized. Twohundred one (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (median 13 days [IQR 9 17]), and 54% (138/257) and 29% (75/257) required vasopressors and renal replacementtherapy, respectively. The median time to clinical deterioration following hospital admission was 3 days (IQR 1 6).

1163	According to what has been reported [1–3], COVID 2019 seems to have similar clinical manifestations to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS CoV. The SARS CoV 2 genome sequence also has ∼80% identity with SARS CoV, but it is most similar to some bat beta coronaviruses, with the highest being >96% identity [4,5]. Given that there are greater than 1,100 nt differences between the human SARS CoV 2 and the bat RaTG13 CoV [4], which are distributed throughout the genome in a naturally occurring pattern following the evolutionary characteristics typical of CoVs, it is highly unlikely that RaTG13 CoV is the immediate source of SARS CoV 2.	0
1164	Coronavirus infection spreads in clusters and therefore early identification of these clusters is critical for slowing down the spread of the virus. Here, we propose that daily population wide surveys that assess the development of symptoms caused by the virus could serve as a strategic and valuable tool for identifying such clusters to inform epidemiologists, public health officials, and policy makers. We show preliminary results from a survey of over 58,000 Israelis and call for an international consortium to extend this concept in order to develop predictive models. We expect such data to allow: Faster detection of spreading zones and patients; Obtaining a current snapshot of the number of people in each area who have developed symptoms; Predicting future spreading zones several days before an outbreak occurs; Evaluating the effectiveness of the various social distancing measures taken, and their contribution to reduce the number of symptomatic people. Such information can provide a valuable tool for decision makers to decide which areas need strengthening of social distancing measures and which areas can be relieved. Preliminary analysis shows that in neighborhoods with confirmed COVID 19 patient history, more responders report on COVID 19 associated symptoms, demonstrating the potential utility of our approach for detection of outbreaks.

1166	"Social distancing is an important measure in controlling epidemics. This paper presents a simple theoretical model focussed on the implications of the wide range in interaction rates between individuals, both within the workplace and in the social setting. The model is based on well mixed populations and so is not intended for studying geographic spread. The model shows that epidemic growth rate is largely determined by the upper interactivity quantiles of society, implying that the most efficient methods of epidemic control are interaction capping approaches rather than overall reductions in interaction.
The theoretical model can also be applied to look at the dynamics of epidemic progression under various scenarios. The theoretical model suggests that with no intervention herd immunity would be achieved with a lower overall infection rate than if variation in interaction rate is ignored, because by this stage almost all the most interactive members of society would have had the infection; however the overall mortality with such an approach is very high. Scenarios for mitigation and suppression suggest that, by using interactivity capping, it should be possible to control an epidemic without extreme sanctions on the majority of the population if R0 of the uncontrolled infection is 2.4. However to control the infection rate to a specific level will always require the switching on and off of measures and for this reason eradication is likely to be a less costly policy in the long run. While social distancing alone can be used for eradication it is not be a good mechanism on its own to prevent reinfection. The use of robust testing, quarantining, and contact tracing would strengthen any social distancing measures, speed up eradication, and be a better tool for prevention of infection or reinfection."	0

The Chinese government has implemented control measures including setting up special hospitals and travel restriction to mitigate the spread. We propose conceptual models for the COVID 19 outbreak in Wuhan with the consideration of individual behavioural reaction and governmental actions, e.g., holiday extension, travel restriction, hospitalisation and quarantine. We employe the estimates of these two key components from the 1918 influenza pandemic in London, United Kingdom, incorporated zoonotic introductions and the emigration, and then compute future trends and the reporting ratio. The model is concise in structure, and it successfully captures the course of the COVID 19 outbreak, and thus sheds light on understanding the trends of the outbreak.	1

1173	The novel coronavirus and its deadly outbreak have posed grand challenges to human society: as of March 26, 2020, there have been 85,377 confirmed cases and 1,293 reported deaths in the United States; and the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized coronavirus disease (COVID 19)  which has infected more than 531,000 people with more than 24,000 deaths in at least 171 countries  a global pandemic. A growing number of areas reporting local sub national community transmission would represent a significant turn for the worse in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which points to an urgent need for expanded surveillance so we can better understand the spread of COVID 19 and thus better respond with actionable strategies for community mitigation. By advancing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and leveraging the largescale and real time data generated from heterogeneous sources (e.g., disease related data from official public health organizations, demographic data, mobility data, and user geneated data from social media), in this work, we propose and develop an AI driven system (named α Satellite), as an initial offering, to provide hierarchical community level risk assessment to assist with the development of strategies for combating the fast evolving COVID 19 pandemic. More specifically, given a specific location (either user input or automatic positioning), the developed system will automatically provide risk indexes associated with it in a hierarchical manner (e.g., state, county, city, specific location) to enable individuals to select appropriate actions for protection while minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible. The developed system and the generated benchmark datasets have been made publicly accessible through our website 1 website.	0
1174	Background: A patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta. The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID 19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID 19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. Methods: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID 19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)  T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. Results: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0 62.0) years were analyzed. After in hospital treatment, patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0 11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019 nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0 16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0 4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R 2 = 0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4  T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (t = À2.699, P = 0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the nonglucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P > 0.05). Conclusions: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID 19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.	0
1175	The paper will attempt to estimate factors which determine the variability of case fatality rates of COVID 19 across OECD countries in the recent time. The objective of the paper is to estimate the impact of government health policies on fatality rates (Case fatality rates) of COVID 19 in OECD countries while controlling for other demographic and economic characteristics. The analysis is done using non parametric regression method, i.e. Quantile regression. The result from quantile regression analysis shows that a policy of Austerity (health expenditure cuts) significantly increases the mortality rates of COVID 19 in OECD countries. The policy implication of the study is the need for a robust public funded health system with wider accessibility to deal with major public health crisis like COVID 19 pandemic.	0

ABSTRACT
CT is a very sensitive technique to detect pneumonia in COVID 19 patients. However, it is impaired by high costs, logistic issues and high risk of exposure. Chest x ray (CXR) is a low cost, low risk, not time consuming technique and is emerging as the recommended imaging modality to use in COVID 19 pandemic.
This technique, although less sensitive than CT scan, can provide useful information about pulmonary involvement.
To describe chest x ray features of COVID 19 pneumonia and to evaluate the sensitivity of this technique in detecting pneumonia. A further scope is to assess the effectiveness of a post processing algorithm in improving lung lesions detectability.
72 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID 19 underwent bedside chest X ray.
Two radiologists were asked to express their opinion about: (i) presence of pneumonia (negative or positive); (ii) localization (unilateral or bilateral); (iii) topography (according to pulmonary fields);
(iv) density (non consolidative ground glass or inhomogeneous opacities; consolidative nodulartype or triangular; mixed consolidative e non consolidative); and (v) presence of pleural effusion.
The point (i) was evaluated separately, while the other points in consensus.
A quality assessment of post processed x ray images was performed by two different readers.
The agreement about presence of pneumonia was almost perfect with K value of 0.933 and p < 0.001. Sensitivity was 69%. : medRxiv preprint
The following findings were seen: unilateral lung involvement in 50%; lower lung lesions in 54%; peripheral distribution in 48%; and non consolidative pattern in 44%.
Post processed images improved the detection of lesions in 7 out 72 patients (≅10%)
CXR owns a good sensitivity in detecting COVID 19 lung involvement. Use of post processing algorithm can improve detection of lesions. Our data support recommendations of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) to consider chest x ray as first step imaging examination in Covid 19 patients.
Bedside CXR has a good sensitivity in evaluating COVID 19 lung involvement in hospitalized patients and should be considered as the first step imaging technique according to RSNA recommendations.
KEY RESULTS
Bedside CXR has a good sensitivity in evaluating COVID 19 lung involvement in non early clinical cases.
• The most common findings of lung involvement were slight different from the well described CT ones, with less common patterns of bilateral and peripheral distribution.
• Post processing algorithm enhances detection of pulmonary lesions."	0

1178	Social distancing has emerged as the primary mitigation strategy to combat the COVID 19 pandemic in the United States. However, large scale evaluation of the public's response to social distancing campaigns has been lacking. We used anonymized and aggregated mobility data from Google Location History users to estimate the impact of social distancing recommendations on bulk mobility among users who have opted into this service. We found that state of emergency declarations resulted in a ~10% reduction in time spent away from places of residence. Implementation of one or more social distancing policies resulted in an additional 25% reduction in mobility the following week. Subsequent shelter in place mandates provided an additional 29% reduction. Our findings provide evidence that state wide mandates are effective in promoting social distancing within this study group.	1

1183	"The COVID 19 Pandemic has literally left the world breathless in the chase for Pharmacotherapy. With the vaccine approval likely more than a year away and novel drugs in early clinical trials, repurposing of existing drugs takes the center stage. A potential drug discussed both in geopolitical and global scientific community is hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). We intend to systematically weigh and analyze the existing evidence of HCQ in the light of published and pre print data available so far.
Registries of the United States, China, WHO ICTRP were electronically searched for studies for the use of HCQ in patients with COVID 19. Pre proof article repositories like MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and ChemRxiv were also included in the search. The literature was critically appraised.
Total 71 articles were available as of 15 th April of which articles of relevance (three invitro studies, two open label non randomized trials, two open label randomized control trials, one follow up study, three reviews, ten short communications) and 88 clinical trials registered in three clinical trial registries were analyzed. HCQ seems to be efficient in inhibiting of SARS CoV 2 in in vitro cell lines; there is lack of strong evidence from human studies.
The in vitro cell culture based data of viral inhibition does not suffice for the use of hydroxychloroquine in the patients with COVID 19. Currently literature shows inadequate, low level evidence in human studies. Scarcity of safety and efficacy data warrants medical communities, health care agencies and governments across the world against the widespread use of HCQ in COVID 19 prophylaxis and treatment, until robust evidence becomes available."	0
1184	"Since the SARS outbreak in 2003, a lot of predictive epidemiological models have been proposed. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, termed as 2019 nCoV, has broken out and is propagating in China and the world. Here we propose a multi model ordinary differential equation set neural network (MMODEs NN) and model free methods to predict the interprovincial transmissions in mainland China, especially those from Hubei Province. Compared with the previously proposed epidemiological models, the proposed network can simulate the transportations with the ODEs activation method, while the model free methods based on the sigmoid function, Gaussian function, and Poisson distribution are linear and fast to generate reasonable predictions. According to the numerical experiments and the realities, the special policies for controlling the disease are successful in some provinces, and the transmission of the epidemic, whose outbreak time is close to the beginning of China Spring Festival travel rush, is more likely to decelerate before February 18 and to end before April 2020. The proposed mathematical and artificial intelligence methods can give consistent and reasonable predictions of the 2019 nCoV ending. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for comprehensive prediction researches of the 2019 nCoV.
Coronavirus, a kind of mammalian avian virus, has caused thousands of infected cases. Two of the most famous coronavirus public health events are the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which outbreak in 2003 and 2015, respectively. At the end of 2019, another coronavirus 1 , termed as 2019 nCoV, was discovered and began transmission in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. Because the outbreak position is one of the most important transportation hubs 2 and the date is close to the annual Spring Festival travel rush 2 (SFTR), the transmission speed of the virus is faster than that of the SARS in 2003. Additionally, due to the fast development of Chinese transportation facilities construction, the disease can spread interprovincially or even internationally, which makes the people and governments concerned.
Due to its high contagion 3, 4 , the virus is still spreading fast, and the amounts of patients are still increasing. Thus, the people and governments need to predict the trend of the epidemic and make better decisions to control the transmission. In previous research works, several mathematical models 5 are proposed, and the ordinary differential equation set (ODEs) driven models have the best interpretability and share the largest ratio."	0

J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f Abstract Background: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease in Wuhan in December 2019, by March 10, 2020, a total of 80,932 confirmed cases have been reported in China. Two consecutively negative RT PCR test results in respiratory tract specimens is required for the evaluation of discharge from hospital, and oropharyngeal swabs were the most common sample.
However, false negative results occurred in the late stage of hospitalization, and avoiding false negative result is critical essential.
We reviewed the medical record of 353 patients who received tests with both specimens simultaneously, and compared the performance between nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs.
Of the 353 patients (outpatients, 192; inpatients, 161) studied, the median age was 54 years, and 177 (50.1%) were women. Higher positive rate (positive tests/total tests) was observed in nasopharyngeal swabs than oropharyngeal swabs, especially in inpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from inpatients showed higher positive rate than outpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from male showed higher positive rate than female, especially in outpatients. Detection with both specimens slightly increased the positive rate than nasopharyngeal swab only. Moreover, the consistency between from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were poor (Kappa=0.308).
In conclusion, our study suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs may be more suitable than oropharyngeal swab at this stage of COVID 19 outbreak."	0

1188	Understanding the temporal dynamics of COVID 19 patient phenotypes is necessary to derive finegrained resolution of the pathophysiology. Here we use state of the art deep neural networks over an institution wide machine intelligence platform for the augmented curation of 8.2 million clinical notes from 14,967 patients subjected to COVID 19 PCR diagnostic testing. By contrasting the Electronic Health Record (EHR) derived clinical phenotypes of COVID 19 positive (COVIDpos, n=272) versus COVID 19 negative (COVIDneg, n=14,695) patients over each day of the week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify diarrhea (2.8 fold), change in appetite (2 fold), anosmia/dysgeusia (28.6 fold), and respiratory failure (2.1 fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The specific combination of cough and diarrhea has a 4 fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR derived signature of COVID 19 (4 7 days prior to typical PCR testing date). This study introduces an Augmented Intelligence platform for the real time synthesis of institutional knowledge captured in EHRs. The platform holds tremendous potential for scaling up curation throughput, with minimal need for training underlying neural networks, thus promising EHRpowered early diagnosis for a broad spectrum of diseases.	0

Whole genome analysis of SARS CoV 2 revealed ~96% genomic similarity with bat CoV (RaTG13) and clustered together in phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, RaTG13 also showed 97.43% spike protein similarity with SARS CoV 2 suggesting that RaTG13 is the closest strain. However, RBD and key amino acid residues supposed to be crucial for human to human and cross species transmission are homologues between SARS CoV 2 and pangolin CoVs. These results from our analysis suggest that SARS CoV 2 is a recombinant virus of bat and pangolin CoVs. Moreover, this study also reports mutations in coding regions of 125 SARS CoV 2 genomes signifying its aptitude for evolution. In short, our findings propose that homologous recombination has been occurred between bat and pangolin CoVs that triggered cross species transmission and emergence of SARS CoV 2, and, during the ongoing outbreak, SARS CoV 2 is still evolving for its adaptability. 2019).

1199	"The pandemic spread of the COVID 19 virus has, as of 20 th of April 2020, reached most countries of the world. In an effort to design informed public health policies, many modelling studies have been performed to predict crucial outcomes of interest, including ICU solicitation, cumulated death counts, etc… The corresponding data analyses however, mostly rely on restricted (openly available) data sources, which typically include daily death rates and confirmed COVID cases time series. In addition, many of these predictions are derived before the peak of the outbreak has been observed yet (as is still currently the case for many countries). In this work, we show that peak phase and data paucity have a substantial impact on the reliability of model predictions. Although we focus on a recent model of the COVID pandemics, our conclusions most likely apply to most existing models, which are variants of the socalled ""Susceptible Infected Removed"" or SIR framework. Our results highlight the need for performing systematic reliability evaluations for all models that currently inform public health policies.

1203	"In the analysis of genomic sequence data, so called ""alignment free"" approaches are often 12 selected for their relative speed compared to alignment based approaches, especially in the 13 application of distance comparisons and taxonomic classification 1,2,3,4 . These methods are 14 typically reliant on excising K length substrings of the input sequence, called K mers 5 . In 15 the context of machine learning, K mer based feature vectors have been used in 16 applications ranging from amplicon sequencing classification to predictive modeling for 17 antimicrobial resistance genes 6,7,8 . This can be seen as an analogy of the ""bag of words"" 18 model successfully employed in natural language processing and computer vision for 19 document and image classification 9,10 . Feature extraction techniques from natural language 20 processing have previously been analogized to genomics data 11 ; however, the ""bag of 21
words"" approach is brittle in the RNA virus space due to the high intersequence variance 22 and the exact matching requirement of K mers. To reconcile the simplicity of ""bag of 23
words"" methods with the complications presented by the intrinsic variance of RNA virus 24 space, a method to resolve the fragility of extracted K mers in a way that faithfully reflects 25 an underlying biological phenomenon was devised. Our algorithm, Vorpal, allows the 26 construction of interpretable linear models with clustered, representative 'degenerate' K 27 mers as the input vector and, through regularization, sparse predictors of binary 28 phenotypes as the output. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Vorpal by identifying 29 nucleotide level genomic motif predictors for binary phenotypes in three separate RNA 30 virus clades; human pathogen vs. non human pathogen in Orthocoronavirinae, 31 hemorrhagic fever causing vs. non hemorrhagic fever causing in Ebolavirus, and human 32 host vs. non human host in Influenza A.

1205	Pooling of samples can increase lab capacity when using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect infections such as COVID 19. However, pool testing is typically performed via an adaptive testing strategy which requires a feedback loop in the lab and at least two PCR runs to confirm positive results. This can cost precious time. We discuss a non adaptive testing method where each sample is distributed in a prescribed manner over several pools, and which yields reliable results after one round of testing. More precisely, assuming knowledge about the overall infection incidence rate, we calculate explicit error bounds on the very favourably with pool size and sample multiplicity. This allows for hugely streamlined PCR testing and cuts in detection times for a large scale testing scenario. A viable consequence of this method could be real time screening of entire communities, frontline healthcare workers and international flight passengers, for example, using the PCR machines currently in operation.	1

1207	Background: Recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM, recurrent ear infection) is a common childhood disease caused by bacteria termed otopathogens, for which current treatments have limited effectiveness. Generic probiotic therapies have shown promise, but seem to lack specificity. We hypothesised that healthy children with no history of AOM carry protective commensal bacteria that could be translated into a specific probiotic therapy to break the cycle of re infection. We characterised the nasopharyngeal microbiome of these children (controls) in comparison to children with rAOM (cases) to identify potentially protective bacteria. As some children with rAOM do not appear to carry any of the known otopathogens, we also hypothesised that characterisation of the middle ear microbiome could identify novel otopathogens, which may also guide the development of more effective therapies. Results: Middle ear fluids, middle ear rinses and ear canal swabs from the cases and nasopharyngeal swabs from both groups underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The nasopharyngeal microbiomes of cases and controls were distinct. We observed a significantly higher abundance of Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum in the nasopharynx of controls. Alloiococcus, Staphylococcus and Turicella were abundant in the middle ear and ear canal of cases, but were uncommon in the nasopharynx of both groups. Gemella and Neisseria were characteristic of the case nasopharynx, but were not prevalent in the middle ear. Conclusions: Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum are characteristic of a healthy nasopharyngeal microbiome. Alloiococcus, Staphylococcus and Turicella are possible novel otopathogens, though their rarity in the nasopharynx and prevalence in the ear canal means that their role as normal aural flora cannot be ruled out. Gemella and Neisseria are unlikely to be novel otopathogens as they do not appear to colonise the middle ear in children with rAOM.	0

Rethinking hospital general ward ventilation design using computational fluid dynamics s u m m a r y Indoor ventilation with good air quality control minimises the spread of airborne respiratory and other infections in hospitals. This article considers the role of ventilation in preventing and controlling infection in hospital general wards and identifies a simple and cost effective ventilation design capable of reducing the chances of cross infection. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis is used to simulate and compare the removal of microbes using a number of different ventilation systems. Instead of the conventional corridor air return arrangement used in most general wards, air return is rearranged so that ventilation is controlled from inside the ward cubicle. In addition to boosting the air ventilation rate, the CFD results reveal that ventilation performance and the removal of microbes can be significantly improved. These improvements are capable of matching the standards maintained in a properly constructed isolation room, though at much lower cost. It is recommended that the newly identified ventilation parameters be widely adopted in the design of new hospital general wards to minimise cross infection. The proposed ventilation system can also be retrofitted in existing hospital general wards with far less disruption and cost than a full scale refurbishment."	0
1209	The emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) has recently added to the list of problematic emerging pathogens in the 21st century, which was suspected to originate from the persons exposed to a seafood or wet market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, suggesting animal to human transmission [2,3]. Many confirmed and susceptible cases have been identified in Wuhan, China, and exported cases have also been reported in neighboring countries including Thailand, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and other countries including the United States, Canada, and European countries, which proves that the virus has the potential for quick dissemination across borders. The coronavirus outbreak has been declared a global health emergency and represents one of tendency to infect a large number of human populations, and the outbreak can cause severe medical complications with economic impact, particularly in middle income countries where resources are limited for early diagnosis and preventive measures.	1
1210	Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019, has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort. This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019 nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat CoV by accumulating non synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019 nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019 nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARSlike bat SL CoVZC45/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA DR alleles of Asia and Asia Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to strains.	0
1211	As the global COVID 19 pandemic escalates there is a need within radiation oncology to work to support our patients in the best way possible. Measures are required to reduce infection spread between patients and within the workforce. Departments need contingency planning to create capacity and on Twitter in March 2020 to discuss these issues and create some consensus on crucial next steps. There were 121 global contributors. This document summarises these discussions around themes of infection prevention, rationalisation of workload and working practice in the presence of infection.	1
1212	Similar to the inflammatory cytokines in SARS and MERS, patients with COVID 19 also have increased plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor α (TNF α),interleukins (IL) 2, 7, and 10, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, and interferon γ inducible protein 10, especially in ICU patients, which implied a cytokine storm occurred [4]. Given that large amount of mononuclear inflammatory lymphocytes have been observed in the biopsy samples at autopsy from COVID 19 patients, we believe that these pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes may enter the pulmonary circulation in large numbers and incite inflammatory storm in severe or critical COVID 19 patients (Fig.	1

1214	A mathematical model was developed describing the dynamic of the COVID 19 virus over a population considering that the infected can either be symptomatic or not. The model was calibrated using data on the confirmed cases and death from several countries like France, Philippines, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, China, and the USA. First, we derived the basic reproduction number, R 0 and estimated the effective reproduction R eff for each countries. Second, we were interested in the merits of containment. Results revealed that total and partial containment is effective in reducing long to eradicate the disease (185 days for France). By setting the end of containment as the day when hospital capacity is reached, numerical simulations showed that the duration can be reduced (up to only 84 days for France if the capacity is 1000 patients). Further, results pointed out that the effective reproduction number remains large after containment. Therefore, testing and isolation are necessary to stop the disease.	1
1215	"Another aspect that should be considered is the difficulty to perform CT scan in many hospitals due to the emergency that several countries are facing. Not all ICU patients who deserve a chest CT scan for suspected pulmonary embolism are promptly diagnosed and indirect objective examinations, i.e., echocardiography or lung ultrasonography do not help. It may be that an unexpected worsening of the respiratory function together with a sudden increase of D dimer levels are suggestive of pulmonary embolism, but this remains to be demonstrated. To date, D dimer levels help in predicting the severity of the disease and patient's prognosis, as patients with high levels at admission die more than those with normal levels [7].
With this panorama and all the uncertainties of care of ICU patients with COVID 19, we believe Journal Pre proof"	0
1216	With the expanding use of molecular assays, viral pathogens are increasingly recognized among critically ill adult patients with community acquired severe respiratory illness; studies have detected respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in 17 53% of such patients. In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides, corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti influenza immune plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. Evidence based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection. Non invasive ventilation in patients with severe RVI causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a high likelihood of transition to invasive ventilation. Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI. There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test different therapeutics both individually and in combination.	0

1218	Background: An epidemic model based only on respiratory droplets and close contact could not fully explain the regional differences in the spread of the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID 19 in Italy, which was fast and dramatic only in Lombardy and Po Valley. On March 16 th 2020, we presented a Position Paper proposing a research hypothesis concerning the association between higher mortality rates due to COVID 19 observed in Northern Italy and the peaks of particulate matter concentrations, frequently exceeding the legal limit of 50 µg/m 3 as PM 10 daily average Methods: To assess environmental factors related to the spread of the COVID 19 in Italy from February 24 th to March 13 th (the date when the lockdown has been imposed over Italy), official daily data relevant to ambient PM 10 levels were collected from all Italian Provinces between February 9 th and February 29 th , taking into account the average time (estimated in 17 days) elapsed between the initial infection and the recorded COVID positivity. In addition to the number of exceedances of PM 10 daily limit value, we considered also population data and daily travelling information per each Province. Results. PM 10 daily limit value exceedances appear to be a significant predictor (p < .001) of infection in univariate analyses. Less polluted Provinces had a median of 0.03 infection cases over 1000 residents, while most polluted Provinces had a median of 0.26 cases over 1000 residents. Thirty nine out of 41 Northern Italian Provinces resulted in the category with highest PM 10 levels, while 62 out of 66 Southern Provinces presented low PM 10 concentrations (p< 0.001). In Milan, the average growth rate before the lockdown was significantly higher than Rome (0.34 vs. 0.27 per day, with a doubling time of 2.0 days vs. 2.6), suggesting a basic reproductive number R 0 >6.0, comparable with the highest values estimated for China.	0
1219	"Among the legal and ethical issues and dilemmas that the World Health Organization (WHO) first outlined for member states’ consideration when undertaking pandemic preparedness planning are state of emergency declarations, movement restrictions, mass gathering prohibitions, school closures, isolation and quarantine, volunteer licensing and liability, drug and vaccine manufacturer liability, research participant protections, compulsory vaccination, and resource rationing [6]. Among Asian countries where honoring older adults, senior personnel, royalty, and public service staff is a strong norm, and where family ties accord strong obligations, privileged access along social hierarchies and familial lines to nationally stockpiled antivirals is not necessarily seen as unethical [14]. Community members were recruited from two areas: the greater San Antonio metropolitan area in Bexar County (comprising urban and semiurban communities with a high percentage of persons of Hispanic origin) and Colorado County (a rural county to the northeast of San Antonio with a largely white and less wealthy population). After reading and rereading notes from the group discussions to ensure familiarity with the data, author EB developed a code list by examining the data relating to each ethical principle for prioritizing ventilator use (morning session) and participants’ responses to the question “Should healthcare providers be allowed to take a ventilator away from one patient who needs it to survive and give it to another patient who also needs it to survive?” ( In some instances, this took the form of participants stating that they and others would be willing to sacrifice themselves for their family members, as one participant in Colorado County stated:
In other instances, participants argued that familial roles should be an important consideration in making allocation decisions, as a respondent in San Antonio suggested:
More broadly, however, participants, and particularly the expert group in San Antonio, referred to the importance of the family as a key cultural value in central Texas that must be considered in light of any policy decisions. Ethicists working on pandemic influenza have proposed that procedural ethics—namely, bringing together diverse communities to weigh in on a policy decision that may affect them so that authorities fairly consider their views and needs—are an important means to respect cultural differences while advancing the common good of stronger preparedness and response systems [14]. Conveners of pandemic related public engagement exercises in the United States have similarly advocated the benefits of transparency and inclusivity in the development of an ethical framework to guide the allocation of finite medical resources such as mechanical ventilators during a public health catastrophe (Multimedia Appendix 1)."	0
1220	"Backgrounds: Up to February 16, 2020, 355 cases have been confirmed as having COVID 19 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship. Method: We fitted the reported serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied ""earlyR"" package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID 19 outbreak. We applied ""projections"" package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Results: The Maximum Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID 19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06 2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384 1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981 1177) and 758 (697 817), respectively. Conclusion: The median with 95% CI of R0 of COVID 19 was about 2.28 (2.06 2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0. Unless strict infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential of COVID 19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship."	0
1221	"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is the causative agent of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) which is currently negatively affecting the population and disrupting the global economy. SARS CoV 2 belongs to the  RNA virus family that utilize single stranded positive sense RNA molecules as genomes. SARS CoV 2, like other coronaviruses, has an unusually large genome for a  RNA virus that encodes four structural proteinsthe matrix (M), small envelope (E), spike (S) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N)  and sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1 16) that together ensure replication of the virus in the host cell. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N is essential for linking the viral genome to the viral membrane. Its N terminal RNA binding domain (N NTD) captures the RNA genome while the Cterminal domain anchors the ribonucleoprotein complex to the viral membrane via its interaction with the M protein.
Here, we characterized the structure of the N NTD and its interaction with RNA using NMR spectroscopy. We observed a positively charged canyon on the surface of the N NTD lined with arginine residues suggesting a putative RNA binding site. Next, we performed an NMR titration experiment using an RNA duplex. The observed changes in positions of signals in the N NTD NMR spectra allowed us to construct a model of the N NTD in complex with RNA."	0

Ultimately, the level of anxiety was significantly higher among people who had at least one family member, relative, or friend who contracted COVID 19 disease (95 % CI [1.2, 35.03], p < 0.001). The health care system should adopt a package of psychosocial interventions to reduce the anxiety of high risk groups.

1226	The current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is caused by the SARS CoV 2 virus and is still spreading rapidly worldwide. Full genome sequence computational analysis of the SARS CoV 2 genome will allow us to understand the recent evolutionary events and adaptability mechanisms more accurately, as there is still neither effective therapeutic nor prophylactic strategy. In this study, we mutation rate and plausible recombination events that may have contributed to the evolution of the SARS CoV 2 virus. Furthermore, we localized targets of recent and strong positive selection. The genomic regions that appear to be under positive selection are largely co localized with regions in which recombination from non human hosts appeared to have taken place in the past. Our results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus genome may have contributed to the SARS CoV 2 genome by recombination with the bat coronavirus genome. However, we find evidence for additional recombination events that involve coronavirus genomes from other hosts, i.e., Hedgehog and Sparrow. Even though recombination events within human hosts cannot be directly assessed, due to the high similarity of SARS CoV 2 genomes, we infer that recombinations may have recently occurred within human hosts using a linkage disequilibrium analysis. In addition, we employed an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to estimate the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an exponential growth of the size of the SARS CoV 2 populations that have infected European, Asian and Northern American cohorts, and we demonstrated that a rapid exponential growth in population size can support the observed polymorphism patterns in SARS CoV 2 genomes.	1
1227	There is a worldwide concern about the new coronavirus 2019 nCoV as a global public health threat. In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequences of 2019 nCoV, 12 whole genome sequences of 2019 nCoV, and 12 highly similar whole genome sequences available in gene bank (five from the severe acute respiratory syndrome, two from Middle East respiratory syndrome, and five from bat SARS like coronavirus). Fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation analysis shows that the nucleocapsid and the spike glycoprotein have some sites under positive pressure, whereas homology modeling revealed some molecular and structural differences between the viruses.	1

1229	"In this work we report that the public reacted on social media at an early stage of the COVID 19 pandemic in a surprisingly accurate way, with activity levels reflecting the severity of the contagion figures registered almost a month later. Specifically, the intensity of COVIDrelated social media activity from different Italian regions at the beginning of the epidemic (21 24/2/2020), predicts well the total number of deaths reached almost a month later (21/3/2020) in each region. It should be noted that at the time of the initial twitter reaction no tabled regional data on the epidemic was readily available. By the 24 th February 2020 only two regions reported death cases and only three reported infected subjects.
Predicting the spread of COVID 19 has become the focus of many academics and amateurs across the globe. There have been proposed several different modeling tools and intuitions for the forecasting of the severity of the infection (1 4) and, despite some success, there is a shared understanding that forecasting the spread and growth of the epidemic is a challenging task. As the spreading mechanism is not yet fully understood and modelled, predicting the contagion and growth within countries and the regions in each country, before data is available, is essentially impossible. However, this task is extremely useful in order to establish targeted confinement areas, hence containing the virus more effectively while reducing the economic and social disruptions due to the lockdown. The knowledge of this would also allow to allocate resources efficiently across regions. In the present work we use data from twitter activity in different Italian regions to estimate crowd perception of the severity of the event. We then relate the intensity of social media interest with the severity of the infection in the same region in terms of the number of deaths registered the following month. Social sciences often used to forecast product sales by resorting to the ""wisdom of the crowds"". These methods works well especially when groups are large and connected opinion dynamics and communication allows crowds to process information (5). In this work we show that such ""wisdom"" turns out to be accurate also in the prediction of COVID 19 infection severity."	0
1230	"COVID 19 associated delayed phase thrombocytopenia was occurred in 11.8% percent of enrolled patients. The delayed phase thrombocytopenia in COVID 19 is prone to develop in elderly patients or patients with low lymphocyte count on admission. The delayed phase thrombocytopenia is significantly associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher ICU admission rate.
Delayed phase nadir platelet counts demonstrated a high and significantly negative linear correlation with B cell percentages and serum IL 6 levels. We also presented bone marrow aspiration pathology of three patients with delayed phase thrombocytopenia, showing impaired maturation of megakaryocytes. We speculated that the delayed phase platelet destruction might be mediated by antibodies, and suggest immunoregulatory treatment in severe patients to improve outcomes. Besides, clinicians need to pay attention to the delayed phase thrombocytopenia especially at 3 4 weeks after symptom onset."	1
1231	"Viral genetic variants are widely known to influence disease progression among infected 25 humans. Given the recent and rapid emergence of pandemic SARS CoV 2 infection, the cause of 26 COVID 19 disease, viral protein variants have attracted research interest. However, little has yet been 27 written about genetic risk factors among human hosts. Human genetic variation has proven to affect 28 disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as HIV infection and malaria infestation. 29
The fact that the human ACE2 protein is encoded on the X chromosome means that males who carry 30 rare ACE2 coding variants will express those variants in all ACE2 expressing cells, whereas females 31 will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early X inactivation events. 32
This sex based difference in ACE2 expression has unique implications for epidemiological studies 33 designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from asymptomatic SARS coV 2 34 infection to COVID 19. Here we present theoretical modelling of rare ACE2 coding variants 35 documented to occur naturally in several human superpopulations and subpopulations, and show that 36 rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ACE2 to the SARS CoV 2 spike protein exist in people."	0

1234	"Le développement cérébral est un phénomène complexe, qui s'étend de la vie foetale à l'adolescence, pendant laquelle la maturation cérébrale suit une série d'événements ordonnés incluant des périodes critiques de plasticité. Le cerveau est particulièrement sensible à l'environnement pendant ces remaniements. Le système endocannabinoïde participe directement et indirectement à ces processus de plasticité et de maturation. Le delta 9tetrahydrocanabinol, principal composant psychoactif du cannabis, diffuse dans le placenta, le lait maternel et le cerveau. Il interagit avec le système endocannabinoïde, notamment par l'activation des récepteurs aux cannabinoïdes 1 CB1R, ce qui peut entraîner des altérations du neurodéveloppement et du fonctionnement des circuits neuronaux. Par conséquent, l'exposition au cannabis in utero, en période périnatale ainsi qu'à l'adolescence est susceptible d'entraîner des perturbations de la maturation cérébrale dont les conséquences, sur le plan cognitif, psychotique et addictif, persistent bien au delà de la période d'exposition. Plusieurs facteurs modulent le risque de telles complications mais les études réalisées sur des modèles animaux ainsi que chez l'homme ont montré qu'une exposition durant les phases critiques, en particulier durant la phase de développement périnatal et à l'adolescence, constitue en soi un facteur de risque. Les données actuelles incitent à diffuser une information objective aux jeunes, pour prévenir et limiter les consommations précoces. © 2020 Publié par Elsevier Masson SAS au nom de l'Académie nationale de médecine. ଝ Étant donné le contexte sanitaire épidémique lié au Covid 19 du mois de mars 2020, la présentation orale de cette communication en séance à l'Académie a été reportée.
Summary.  Brain development is a complex phenomenon, stretching from fetal life to adolescence, during which brain maturation proceeds through a series of ordered events including critical periods of plasticity. The brain is particularly sensitive to the environment during these changes. The endocannabinoid system participates directly and indirectly in these plasticity and maturation processes. The main psychoactive component of cannabis, the delta 9 tetrahydrocanabinol, can cross the placental barrier, is present in breastmilk and diffuses in the brain. It interacts with the endocannabinoid signaling, especially through the activation of cannabinoid receptors 1 CB1R, which can lead to abnormal neurodevelopmental processes and neuronal circuits functions. Therefore, exposure to cannabis in utero, in perinatal phase, as well as during the adolescence disrupts the brain maturation and can cause disturbances on the cognitive, psychotic and addictive levels that persist far beyond the period of exposure. Several factors modulate the risk of such complications, but studies performed in animal models as well as in human cohorts have shown that exposure during both the critical perinatal and adolescence phases is a risk factor per se. Current knowledge encourages the dissemination of objective information to young people, to prevent and limit early exposure and its consequences."	0

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has caused a pandemic threatening global public health. In the current paper, we describe our successful treatment of three COVID 19 pneumonia patients cases including severe cases and cases with mortality risk factors. One 32 year old male COVID 19 patient was diagnosed with severe COVID 19 pneumonia and moderate ARDS. The second COVID 19 pneumonia patient had a history of diabetes and chronic bronchitis. The third case of COVID 19 pneumonia was an 82 year old female patient. All three cases had severe COVID pneumonia and therefore were aggressively managed with a multidisciplinary and personalized therapeutic approach that included nutritional support, antiviral pharmacotherapy, active control of comorbidities, prevention of complication development and psychological intervention.

1240	The COVID 19 crisis called for rapid reaction from all the fields of biomedical research. Traditional drug development involve time consuming pipelines that conflict with the urgence of identifying effective therapies during a health and economic emergency. Drug repositioning, that is the discovery of new clinical applications for drugs already approved for different therapeutic contexts, could provide an effective shortcut to bring COVID 19 treatments to the bedside in a timely manner. Moreover, computational approaches can help accelerate the process even further. Here we present the application of different software tools based on transcriptomics data to identify drugs that are potentially able to counteract SARS CoV 2 infection and also to provide insights on their mode of action. We believe that HDAC inhibitors warrant further investigation. In addition, we found that the DNA Mismatch repair pathway is strongly modulated by drugs with experimental in vitro activity against SARS CoV 2 infection.	0

However, to date, there is no detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID 19 patients with eosinopenia. . We described clincial characteristics of patients with COIVD 19 and eosinopenia phenotype.
The median age of patients with COVID 19 was 39 years old, and 32 (54,2%) were male. Patients with severe type had higher proportions of dyspnea (50%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (50%) compared with mild or moderate patients.
Laboratory findings indicated that lower counts of lymphocyte and eosnophils were observed in patients with severe type. Cough, sputum, and fatigue were more common symptoms in eosinopenia patients compared with non eosinopenia patients.
High proportion of comorbidities was observed in eosinopenia patients. Laboratory findings indicated that lymphocyte counts (median: 101 cells/μl ) in eosinopenia patients were significantly less than those of non eosinopenia patients (median: 167 cells/μl, p<0.001). The use of corticosteroids therapy in COVID 19 patients with : medRxiv preprint eosinopenia were notably higher than those in patients with non eosinopenia (50% vs 13.8%, respectively, p=0.005).

1242	Exploration and exploitation are two generic strategies of firms' adaptation to their environments. However, the effectiveness and reliability organizational adaptation, strategic fit, and organizational decline streams of literature, we develop a framework that examines exploration and exploitation in crisis contexts. We argue that the severity of crisis a firm is exposed to acts as a positive contingency for the impact of exploration on firm performance level and variability, and as a negative contingency for exploitation's level and variability effects. Employing the multiplicative heteroscedasticity regression model on the data from 500 Russian SMEs, we test the proposed theoretical framework linking exploration and exploitation activities to the distribution of firm performance under different conditions of the firm specific crisis severity. The results provide an improved understanding of strategic management approaches under economic crises and related turbulence.	1

1244	"Background: Coronavirus (COVID 19) poses health system challenges in every country. As with any public health emergency, a major component of the global response is timely, effective science. However, particular factors specific to COVID 19 must be overcome to ensure that research efforts are optimised. We aimed to model the impact of COVID 19 on the clinical academic response in the UK, and to provide recommendations for COVIDrelated research.
We constructed a simple stochastic model to determine clinical academic capacity in the UK in four policy approaches to COVID 19 with differing population infection rates:
""Italy model"" (6%), ""mitigation"" (10%), ""relaxed mitigation"" (40%) and ""do nothing"" (80%) scenarios. The ability to conduct research in the COVID 19 climate is affected by the following key factors: (i) infection growth rate and population infection rate (from UK COVID 19 statistics and WHO); (ii) strain on the healthcare system (from published model); and (iii) availability of clinical academic staff with appropriate skillsets affected by frontline clinical activity and sickness (from UK statistics).
In ""Italy model"", ""mitigation"", ""relaxed mitigation"" and ""do nothing"" scenarios, from 5 March 2020 the duration (days) and peak infection rates (%) are 95(2.4%), 115(2.5%), 240(5.3%) and 240(16.7%) respectively. Near complete attrition of academia (87% reduction, <400 clinical academics) occurs 35 days after pandemic start for 11, 34, 62, 76 days respectively  with no clinical academics at all for 37 days in the ""do nothing"" scenario.
Restoration of normal academic workforce (80% of normal capacity) takes 11,12, 30 and 26 weeks respectively.
Interpretation: Pandemic COVID 19 crushes the science needed at system level. National policies mitigate, but the academic community needs to adapt. We highlight six key strategies: radical prioritisation (eg 3 4 research ideas per institution), deep resourcing, nonstandard leadership (repurposing of key non frontline teams), rationalisation (profoundly simple approaches), careful site selection (eg protected sites with large academic backup) and complete suspension of academic competition with collaborative approaches."	0

1246	"SARS CoV 2 is an unprecedented worldwide health problem that requires concerted and global approaches to better understand the virus in order to develop novel therapeutic approaches to stop the COVID 19 pandemic and to better prepare against potential future emergence of novel pandemic viruses. Although SARS CoV 2 primarily targets cells of the lung epithelium causing respiratory infection and pathologies, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also infected. However, the importance of the enteric phase of SARS CoV 2 for virus induced pathologies, spreading and prognosis remains unknown.
Here, using both colon derived cell lines and primary non transformed colon organoids, we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of SARS CoV 2 lifecycle in human intestinal epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells fully support SARS CoV 2 infection, replication and production of infectious de novo virus particles. Importantly, we identified intestinal epithelial cells as the best culture model to propagate SARS CoV 2. We found that viral infection elicited an extremely robust intrinsic immune response where, interestingly, type III interferon mediated response was significantly more efficient at controlling SARS CoV 2 replication and spread compared to type I interferon.
Taken together, our data demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells are a productive site of SARS CoV 2 replication and suggest that the enteric phase of SARS CoV 2 may participate in the pathologies observed in COVID 19 patients by contributing in increasing patient viremia and by fueling an exacerbated cytokine response."	0

Methods: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID 19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. Findings: Of the 40 COVID 19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts [0·6 (0·6 0·8)] but increases in neutrophil counts [4·7 (3·6 5·8)] than 27 mild cases [1.1 (0·8 1·4); 2·0 (1·5 2·9)].
Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8   T cells, as well as increases in IL 6, IL 10, IL 2 and IFN γ levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID 19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases.
Moreover, the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (AUC=0·93) and neutrophil to CD8   T cell ratio (N8R) (AUC =0·94) were identified as powerful prognostic factors affecting the prognosis for severe COVID 19.
Interpretation: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID 19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. N8R and NLR may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early 4 identification of severe COVID 19 cases."	0

1251	We have applied a computational strategy, based on the synergy of virtual screening, docking and molecular dynamics techniques, aimed at identifying possible lead compounds for the non covalent inhibition of the main protease 3CL pro of the SARS Cov2 Coronavirus. Based on the recently resolved 6LU7 PDB structure, ligands were generated using a multimodal structure based design and then optimally docked to the 6LU7 monomer. Docking calculations show that ligand binding is strikingly similar in SARS CoV and SARS CoV2 main proteases, irrespectively of the protonation state of the catalytic CYS HIS dyad. The most potent docked ligands are found to share a common binding pattern with aromatic moieties connected by rotatable bonds in a pseudo linear arrangement. Molecular dynamics calculations fully confirm the stability in the 3CL pro binding pocket of most potent binder identified by docking, namely a chlorophenyl pyridyl carboxamide derivative.	0
1252	"Background: It has been projected that there will be too few ventilators to meet demand during the COVID 19 (SARS CoV 2) pandemic. Ventilator sharing has been suggested as a crisis standard of care strategy to increase availability of mechanical ventilation. The safety and practicality of shared ventilation in patients is unknown. We designed and evaluated a system whereby one mechanical ventilator can be used to simultaneously ventilate two patients who have different lung compliances using a custom manufactured flow control valve to allow for individual adjustment of tidal volume and airway pressure for each patient.
The system was first evaluated in a simulation lab using two human patient simulators under expected clinical conditions. It was then tested in an observational study of four patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID 19. Two separately ventilated COVID 19 patients were connected to a single ventilator for one hour. This intervention was repeated in a second pair of patients. Ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, peak airway pressures, compliance) were recorded at five minute intervals during both studys. Arterial blood gases were taken at zero, thirty, and sixty minutes. The primary outcome was maintenance of stable acid base status and oxygenation during shared ventilation.

The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019 nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1 31 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019 nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4 th quantile being the highest risk and 1 st quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The risk index of 2019 nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the WHO reported confirmed cases (0.97).

COVID 19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2, which enters human target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used a number of bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell specific expression, putative functions, and transcriptional regulation. The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 than any other organ. The large intestine, kidney and testis showed moderate signals, whereas the signal was weak in the lung specimens. Single cell RNA Seq data indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in the key protective cell types including the goblet and ciliary epithelial cells, as well as in the endothelial cells and type I pneumocytes. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in renin angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis.

1265	2019 nCoV is a newly identified coronavirus with high similarity to SARS CoV. We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures. However, 2019 nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019 nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019 nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019 nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal oral and other routes of transmission are also possible. Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus.	0

Pearson's correlation and generalized additive modeling were performed to assess the relationships between daily new COVID 19 cases and meteorological factors (daily average temperature and relative humidity) with the most updated data currently available.
The Pearson correlation showed that daily new confirmed cases of COVID 19 were more correlated with the average temperature than with relative humidity. Daily new confirmed cases were negatively correlated with the average temperature in Beijing (r= 0.565, P<0.01), Shanghai (r= 0.471, P<0.01), and Guangzhou (r= 0.530, P<0.01) , yet in contrast, positively correlated with that in Japan (r=0.441, P<0.01).

Methods: A bundled approach of active and enhanced laboratory surveillance, early airborne infection isolation, rapid molecular diagnostic testing, and contact tracing for healthcare workers (HCWs) with unprotected exposure in the hospitals was implemented. Epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases, environmental samples, and air samples were collected and analyzed.
Results: From day 1 to day 42, 42 of 1,275 patients (3.3%) fulfilling active (n = 29) and enhanced laboratory surveillance (n = 13) were confirmed to have the SARS CoV 2 infection. The number of locally acquired case significantly increased from 1 of 13 confirmed cases (7.7%, day 22 to day 32) to 27 of 29 confirmed cases (93.1%, day 33 to day 42; P < .001).

SARS CoV 2 was identified in 1 of 13 environmental samples (7.7%) but not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from the patient's chin with or without wearing a surgical mask.
Conclusion: Appropriate hospital infection control measures was able to prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS CoV 2."	0

1271	Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulencerelated genes in novel agents, as we show here for the SARS CoV 2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID 19 pandemic in 2020.	0

1274	"Article Summary: SARS CoV 2 has similar replication kinetics to SARS CoV, but demonstrates significant sensitivity to type I interferon treatment.
Abstract 1 SARS CoV 2, a novel coronavirus (CoV), has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of 2 viral pneumonia around the world. While genetically distinct from the original SARS CoV, both 3 group 2B CoVs share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses harbored in 4 bats. Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from SARS CoV infection to inform 5 treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate type I Interferon (IFN I) 6
sensitivity of SARS CoV 2 relative to the original SARS CoV. Our results indicate that while 7 SARS CoV 2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to SARS CoV in Vero cell, the novel 8
CoV is much more sensitive to IFN I pretreatment. Examining transcriptional factor activation 9 and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) induction, SARS CoV 2 in the context of type I IFN 10 induces phosphorylation of STAT1 and increased ISG proteins. In contrast, the original SARS 11
CoV has no evidence for STAT1 phosphorylation or ISG protein increases even in the presence 12 of type I IFN pretreatment. Next, we examined IFN competent Calu3 2B4 cells finding SARS 13
CoV 2 had reduced viral replication relative to SARS CoV and induced STAT1 phosphorylation 14 late during infection. Finally, we examined homology between SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2 in 15 viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. The absence of open reading frame (ORF) 3b 16 and significant changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN antagonists may not maintain 17 equivalent function in SARS CoV 2. Together, the results identify key differences in 18 susceptibility to the IFN I response between SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2. that could help 19 inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development. 20
With the ongoing outbreak of COVID 19 disease, differences between the SARS CoV 2 and the 22 original SARS CoV could be leveraged to inform disease progression and eventual treatment 23
options. In addition, these findings could have key implications for animal model development 24
as well as further research into how SARS CoV 2 modulates the type I IFN response early 25 during infection."	0
1275	"The SARS CoV 2 coronavirus, the etiologic agent responsible for COVID 19 coronavirus disease, is a global threat. To better understand viral tropism, we assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium.
We found that ACE2, as well as the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells. In depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS CoV 2 infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy. Wellcome Trust Genome"	0

1278	This chapter gives an overview of the paradoxical dynamic that shapes the World; with on the one hand an ever wider inequality gap; over exploitation of natural resources and climate change; and on the other hand, a growing understanding of the possibilities and technology. This chapter points out some of the reasons for the insufficient progress made by traditional approaches to development and humanitarian aid. It offers arguments why nonprofit institutions whose justification is to help, must begin by helping their staff to help themselves. Organizations with an inspiring social mission must practice internally what they preach externally. Whether these organizations live up to the inspirational potential that goes with their mandate, is conditioned by their ability to place the aspiration for meaning at the center of their action, internally and externally.	1

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as an entry point into cells for some strains of coronavirus (SARS CoV, MERS CoV, SARS CoV 2). Our hypothesis was that as ACE2 is essential to the SARS CoV 2 virus invasion, then brain regions where ACE2 is the most expressed are more likely to be disturbed by the infection.
Thus, the expression of other Genes whose co expression is spatially correlated to that of ACE2 were then clustered into 16 groups, depending on the organ in which they are the most expressed (as described by the NCBI genes database).

Objective. To study differences in the presentation of laboratory confirmed acute viral respiratory infections, especially gastroenteritis symptoms, according to age and causative viral agent during five influenza seasons (1999 to 2004.) Material and methods. Five influenza seasons (1999 2000 to 2003 2004) were studied. Data from samples taken at 24 primary care sentinel centres for influenza sur Torner N, et al. Sintomatología gastrointestinal en las infecciones respiratorias agudas de etiología viral veillance distributed throughout Catalonia (Spain), which were positive for any of the viruses studied (influenza virus A, [IVA], influenza virus B [IVB], syncytial respiratory virus [SRV], adenovirus [ADV] and parainfluenza 1,2,3 viruses), were analyzed. The following clinical variables were evaluated: sudden onset, fever, respiratory symptoms, sore throat, malaise and gastrointestinal symptoms. These variables were studied for each virus and for two age groups: age 14 years or younger and older than 14 years. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
Results. Of a total of 1,591 samples tested during the influenza seasons studied, 42.68% (679) samples belonged to subjects aged ≤ 14 years and 57.32% (912) to subjects aged > 14 years. There were 286 IVA (166/286 [58.04%] in subjects aged ≤ 14 years and 120/286 [41.95%] in subjects aged > 14 years), 107 were positive for IVB (78/107 [72.90%] in subjects aged ≤ 14 years and 29/107 [27.10%] in subjects aged > 14 years), 53 SRV (39/53 [73.58%] in subjects aged ≤ 14 years and 12/53 [22.64%] in subjects aged > 14 years) and 40 ADV (36/40 [90%] in subjects aged ≤ 14 years and 4/40 [10%]
in subjects aged > 14 years). The differences in symptoms between the two age groups could be compared for IVA: fever (OR = 16.536; 95% CI = 4.893 55.887; p = 0.001) and gastrointestinal symptoms (OR = 4.664; 95% CI = 1.569 13.868; p < 0.03) were significantly more frequent in subjects aged ≤ 14 years, while malaise (OR = 0.048; 95% CI = 0.026 0.089; p =0.001) was more frequent in subjects aged > 14 years.
The results indicate that acute viral respiratory infections always present with fever in children, whatever the virus, but not in adults. Gastrointestinal symptoms were more strongly associated with IVA and IVB and these symptoms were most frequent in children aged under 5 years."	0
1283	. Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID 19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID 19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT PCR from oral nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID 19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a model showing that CT scan is endowed with a high negative predictive value (> 90%) and positive predictive value (69  84%), for the range of prevalence seen in countries with rampant dissemination. We conclude that CT is an expedite and reliable diagnostic tool to support first line triage of suspect COVID 19 patients in areas where the diffusion of the virus is widespread.	0

1285	"A novel coronavirus (CoV), the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus  2 (SARS CoV 2), results in the coronavirus disease 2019 . As information concerning the COVID 19 disease continues to evolve, patients look to their eye care practitioners for accurate eye health guidance. There is currently no evidence to suggest an increased risk of contracting COVID 19 through contact lens (CL) wear compared to spectacle lens wear and no scientific evidence that wearing standard prescription spectacles provides protection against COVID 19 or other viral transmissions.
During the pandemic there will potentially be significant changes in access to local eyecare. Thus, it is imperative CL wearers are reminded of the steps they should follow to minimise their risk of complications, to reduce their need to leave isolation and seek care. Management of adverse events should be retained within optometric systems if possible, to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare service, which will be stretched. Optimal CL care behaviours should be the same as those under normal circumstances, which include appropriate hand washing (thoroughly with soap and water) and drying (with paper towels) before both CL application and removal. Daily CL cleaning and correct case care for reusable CL should be followed according to appropriate guidelines, and CL exposure to water must be avoided. Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners should consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available). Patients should also avoid touching their face, including their eyes, nose and mouth, with unwashed hands and avoid CL wear altogether if unwell (particularly with any cold or flu like symptoms)."	0

1287	Yet other authors have indicated that the expression of ACE2 is primarily located on the luminal surface of differentiated small intestinal epithelial cells, whereas lower expression has been observed in the crypt cells and the colon.7 They have also linked the amino acid transport function of ACE2 to the microbial ecology in the gastrointestinal tract in which ACE2 mutants exhibit decreased expression of antimicrobial peptides and show altered gut microbial composition. Numerous studies have shown that modulating gut microbiota can reduce enteritis and ventilator‐associated pneumonia, and it can reverse certain side effects of antibiotics to avoid early influenza virus replication in lung epithelia.8 Currently, there is no direct clinical evidence that the modulation of gut microbiota plays the therapeutic role in the treatment of COVID‐19, but we speculate that targeting gut microbiota may be a new therapeutic option or at least an adjuvant therapeutic choice.	1
1288	From December 2019, an outbreak of unusual pneumonia was reported in Wuhan with many cases linked to Huanan Seafood Market that sells seafood as well as live exotic animals. We investigated two patients who developed acute respiratory syndromes after independent contact history with this market. The two patients shared common clinical features including fever, cough, and multiple ground glass opacities in the bilateral lung field with patchy infiltration. Here, we highlight the use of a low input metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) approach on RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). It rapidly identified a novel coronavirus (named 2019 nCoV according to World Health Organization announcement) which was the sole pathogens in the sample with very high abundance level (1.5% and 0.62% of total RNA sequenced). The entire viral genome is 29,881 nt in length (GenBank MN988668 and MN988669, Sequence Read Archive database Bioproject accession PRJNA601736) and is classified into β coronavirus genus. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that 2019 nCoV is close to coronaviruses (CoVs) circulating in Rhinolophus (Horseshoe bats), such as 98.7% nucleotide identity to partial RdRp gene of bat coronavirus strain BtCoV/ 4991 (GenBank KP876546, 370 nt sequence of RdRp and lack of other genome sequence) and 87.9% nucleotide identity to bat coronavirus strain bat SL CoVZC45 and bat SL CoVZXC21. Evolutionary analysis based on ORF1a/1b, S, and N genes also suggests 2019 nCoV is more likely a novel CoV independently introduced from animals to humans.	0
1289	The rapid spread of COVID 19 is a global public health challenge. To prevent the escalation of its transmission, China locked down one third of its cities and strictly restricted personal mobility and economic activities. Using timely and comprehensive air quality these counter COVID 19 measures led to a remarkable improvement in air quality. Within weeks, the Air Quality Index and PM2.5 concentrations were brought down by 25%. The effects are larger in colder, richer, and more industrialized cities. We estimate that such improvement would avert 24,000 to 36,000 premature deaths from air pollution on a monthly basis.	1

En todas ellas el objetivo principal de los diversos abordajes de la terapia génica es el transducir los genes terapéuticos en la mayor parte de las células diana. A nivel de enfermedades crónicas o inmunológicas se requiere, asimismo, una expresión estable de los genes terapéuticos y a nivel de las células tumorales la eficiencia o porcentaje de células transducidas condiciona el éxito de los tratamientos. Por consiguiente, los vectores son uno de los elementos básicos para optimizar los abordajes y protocolos de terapia génica dado que sabemos que con el empleo de liposomas menos del 10% de las células van a ser transducidas, que con el empleo de retrovirus sólo se van a infectar células en replicación y que con los adenovirus va a haber una respuesta inflamatoria importante y una transducción transitoria del gen terapéutico.

In this review the current situation of gene therapy is described in hematological diseases, immunological conditions, and cancer. In all of them, the principal objective of various approaches with gene therapy is transduction of therapeutic genes in most of target cells. In chronic or immunological diseases, a stable expression of therapeutic genes is also required; in tumor cells, the efficiency or porcentage of transduced cells make conditional on the treatment success. Consequently, vectors are one of the basic elements to optimize gene therapy approaches and protocols in view of the facts that we know that with liposomes less than 10% of cells are transduced, that retrovirus only infect cells in replication, and that adenovirus give rise to an important inflammatory response and a transitory transduction of the therapeutic gene. In addition recent approaches in cancer gene therapy with selective replication virus, suicidal genes, etc., are discussed."	1

To achieve early and accurate diagnostics, determining the radiological characteristics of the disease is of great importance. In this small scale research we retrospectively reviewed and selected six cases confirmed with 2019 nCoV infection in West China Hospital and investigated their initial and follow up HRCT features, along with the clinical characteristics. The 2019 nCoV pneumonia basically showed a multifocal or unifocal involvement of ground glass opacity (GGO), sometimes with consolidation and fibrosis. No pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy was identified in our presented cases. The follow up CT generally demonstrated mild to moderate progression of the lesion, with only one case showing remission by the reducing extent and density of the airspace opacification.	0

1297	However, these conditions appear to track closely with advancing age,13 which is emerging as the strongest predictor of Covid 19–related death.14 Unfortunately, reports to date have not rigorously accounted for age or other key factors that contribute to health as potential confounders in risk prediction. Although reported rates of chronic kidney disease appear to be low among hospitalized patients with Covid 19 in China (1 to 3%) (Table S1), the prevalence may be higher among patients who are critically ill and among those in other geographic regions.59 Many patients have varying degrees of acute kidney injury during illness.14,67,68 For these high risk patients, individualized treatment decisions regarding the maintenance of RAAS inhibitors that are guided by hemodynamic status, renal function, and clinical stability are recommended.	1
1298	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak once again demonstrated the importance of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in patients with diabetes. Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1 7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patient's blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients 19.	0

Findings: African American race and Hispanic ethnicity are associated with higher likelihood of SARS CoV 2 infection even after adjusting for other important socio demographic and comorbidity factors. Residence in a high density population area partially mediated higher susceptibility among African Americans. Meaning: Minority race and ethnicity increases susceptibility to SARS CoV 2 infection in a large U.S. Metropolitan area. Though several factors may increase chances of infection among minorities; residence in population dense areas and therefore inability to adequately practice social distancing may explain higher infectivity. Abstract Importance: Despite emerging reports of poor COVID 19 outcomes among African Americans, data on race and ethnic susceptibility to SARS CoV 2 infection are limited. Objective: To determine socio demographic factors associated with higher likelihood of SARS CoV 2 infection. To explore mediating pathways for race disparities in the SARS CoV 2 pandemic.

Therefore dapsone might lower neutrophils' contributions to ARDS lung pathology. Dapsone can create methemoglobinemia that although rarely problematic it would be particularly undesirable in ARDS. The common antacid drug cimetidine lowers risk of dapsone related methemoglobinemia and should be given concomitantly.

1304	As the SARS CoV 2 pandemic is rapidly progressing, the need for the development of an effective vaccine is critical. A promising approach for vaccine development is to generate, through codon pair deoptimization, an attenuated virus. This approach carries the advantage that it only requires limited knowledge specific to the virus in question, other than its genome sequence. Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses for which we may not have extensive data. We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several features of SARS CoV 2 genomic sequence (e.g., codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotide/junction dinucleotide usage, RNA structure around the frameshift region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus. Our analysis identified the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as promising targets for deoptimization and suggests a roadmap for SARS CoV 2 vaccine development, which can be generalizable to other viruses.	0

1307	"In the night of February 20, 2020, the first case of novel coronavirus disease was confirmed in the Lombardy Region, Italy. In the week that followed, Lombardy experienced a very rapid increase in the number of cases. We analyzed the first 5,830 laboratory confirmed cases to provide the first epidemiological characterization of a COVID 19 outbreak in a Western Country.
Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of confirmed cases and their close contacts. We collected demographic backgrounds, dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results, hospitalization, contact tracing. We provide estimates of the reproduction number and serial interval.
The epidemic in Italy started much earlier than February 20, 2020. At the time of detection of the first COVID 19 case, the epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of Southern Lombardy. The median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of positive subjects were hospitalized. Among these, 18% required intensive care. The mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% CI, 0.7 to 19). We estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2). We estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around February 20, 2020. We did not observe significantly different viral loads in nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic.
The transmission potential of COVID 19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short time horizon. We observed a slight decrease of the reproduction number, possibly connected with an increased population awareness and early effect of interventions. Aggressive containment strategies are required to control COVID 19 spread and catastrophic outcomes for the healthcare system.
According to WHO suggestions, nasal swabs (UTM viral transport ®, Copan Italia S.p.a) from all suspected cases were tested with at least two real time RT PCR assays targeting different genes (E and RdRp) of SARS CoV 2 [1]. In addition, a novel quantitative real time RT PCR targeting an additional SARS CoV 2 gene (M) was developed (details provided upon request). From February 21 to February 25, all suspected cases and asymptomatic contacts were tested. From February 26 onward, testing was applied only to symptomatic patients."	0
1308	For this study, free tailed bats were chosen for two reasons: (a) opportunity; the bats were from a conservation site wherein the animals’ well being is periodically evaluated and bat fecal samples were available for evaluation; and (b) they are among the most abundant bats often found roosting in buildings in Florida, and hence are most likely to interact with humans. Briefly, viral RNA was denatured at 65 °C for 5 min in the presence of SUPERase In RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA, Cat AM2694), cooled rapidly on ice and cDNA synthesis performed with Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase (RT) (Qiagen, Cat  205111) for 1 h at 37 °C using primer CorTheoNL63R1 (5′ CCRTCATCAGANAGAATCATCAT 3′).	0
1309	"Macroscopic growth laws describe in an effective way the underlying complex dynamics of the spreading of infections, as in the case of CoviD 19, where the counting of the cumulative number N (t) of detected infected individuals is a generally accepted variable to understand the epidemic phase. However N (t) does not take into account the unknown number of asymptomatic cases A(t).
The considered model of CoviD 19 spreading is based on a system of coupled differential equations, which include the dynamics of the spreading among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and the strong containment effects due to the social isolation. The solution has ben compared with N (t), determined by a single differential equation with no explicit reference to A(t), showing the equivalence of the two methods. The model is applied to Covid 19 spreading in Italy where a transition from an exponential behavior to a Gompertz growth for N (t) has been observed in more recent data. The information contained in the time series N (t) turns out to be reliable to understand the epidemic phase, although it does not describe the total infected population. The asymptomatic population is larger spreading."	0
1310	"A newly identified coronavirus, 2019 nCoV, has been posing significant threats to public health since December 2019. ACE2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019 nCoV infection. Interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of SARS and 2019 nCoV patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell RNA seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. The results indicated that virus might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. This finding suggested the liver abnormalities of SARS and 2019 nCoV patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury.

1315	"Background and Aim. There is a paucity of data on the COVID 19 pandemic in Vietnam. In this paper, we sought to provide an epidemiologic description of patients who were infected with SARS Cov 2 in Vietnam.
Methods. Data were abstracted from the wikipedia's COVID 19 information resource and Johns Hopkins University Dashboard. Demographic data and treatment status were obtained for each patient in each day. The coverage period was from 23/1/2020 to 10/4/2020.
Descriptive analyses of incident cases were stratified by gender and age group. The estimation of the reproduction ratio was done with a bootstrap method using the R statistical environment.
Results. During the coverage period, Vietnam has recorded 257 cases of COVID 19.
Approximately 54% of the cases were women. The median age of patients was 30 years (range: 3 months to 88 years), with 78% of patients aged 49 or younger. About 66% (n = 171) of patients were overseas tourists (20%) and Vietnamese students or workers returning from overseas (46%). Approximately 57% (n = 144) of patients have been recovered and discharged from hospitals. There have been no mortality. The reproduction ratio was estimated to range between 0.95 and 1.24.
Conclusion. These data indicate that a majority of COVID 19 patients in Vietnam was imported cases in overseas tourists and young students and workers who had returned from overseas.

1316	We take up a recently proposed compartmental SEIQR model with delays, ignore loss of immunity in the context of a fast pandemic, extend the model to a network structured on infectivity, and consider the continuum limit of the same with a simple separable interaction model for the infectivities β. Numerical simulations show that the evolving dynamics of the network is effectively captured by a single scalar function of time, regardless of the distribution of β in the population. The continuum limit of the network model allows a simple derivation of the simpler model, which is a single scalar delay differential equation (DDE), wherein the variation in β appears through an integral closely related to the moment generating function of u = √ β. If the first few moments of u exist, the governing DDE can be expanded in a series that shows a direct correspondence with the original compartmental DDE with a single β. Even otherwise, the new scalar DDE can be solved using either numerical integration over u at each time step, or with the analytical integral if available in some useful form. Our work provides a new academic example of complete dimensional collapse, ties up an underlying continuum model for a pandemic with a simpler seeming compartmental model, epidemics.	0
1317	COVID 19 has created an interesting discourse among the people of the world particularly regarding preventive measures of infectious diseases. In this paper, the authors forecast the spread of the Coronavirus outbreak and study how the reduction of transmission rates influences its decline. The paper makes use of the SIR (Susceptible Infected Recovered) Model which is a deterministic model used in the field of epidemiology based on differential equations derived from sections of the population. The Basic Reproduction Number (R o ) represents the criticality of the epidemic in numeric terms. Forecasting an epidemic provides insights about the geographic spreading of the disease and the case incidences required to better inform intervention strategists about situations that may occur during the outbreak. Through this research paper, the authors wish to provide an insight into the impact of control measures on the pandemic. By drawing a comparison of three countries and their quarantine measures, observations on the decline of the outbreak are made. Authors intend to guide the intervention strategies of under resourced countries like India and aid in the overall containment of the outbreak.	0

1319	An outbreak of COVID 19 developed aboard the Princess Cruises Ship during January February 2020. Using mathematical characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak. Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 1.1 7). Our findings suggest that R t decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control. Most recent estimates of R t reached values largely below the epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.	1
1320	The newly emergent human virus SARS CoV 2 is resulting in high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems. Preventing further transmission is a priority. We analyzed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact tracing needed to stop the epidemic. We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale. A contact tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without need for mass quarantines ('lock downs') that are harmful to society. We discuss the ethical requirements for an intervention of this kind.	1
1321	Purpose: To investigate the imaging features of emerging COVID 19 pneumonia on chest ultrasound (US), radiographs (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) examinations performed at admission and to provide a comprehensive radiological literature review on ongoing radiological data from recent publications. Materials and methods: In this retrospective single center study, we enrolled consecutive patients from February 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, with laboratory confirmed SARS CoV 2 hospitalized in Valduce Hospital (Como, Italy). Multi modality imaging findings were evaluated and compared. Literature research was conducted through a methodical search on Pubmed and Embase databases. Results: Fifty eight patients (36 men, 22 women; age range, 18 98 years) were included in the study. Among these, chest US, CXR, and CT were performed respectively in twenty two, thirty two and forty two patients. Lung US findings were consistent with diffuse B lines (100%) and subpleural consolidations (27.3%). CXR showed prevalent manifestations of consolidations (46.9%) and hazy increased opacities (37.5%). Typical CT features included bilateral and multilobar ground glass opacities (GGO) with (59.5%) and without (35.7%) consolidations having a predominantly peripheral distribution (64.3%). Other imaging features included crazy paving pattern (57.1%), fibrous stripes (50%), subpleural lines (35.7%), architectural distortion (28.6%), air bronchogram sign (26.2%), vascular thickening (23.8%) and nodules (2.4%). Also, enlarged lymph nodes (14.3 %) and pleural effusion (7.1%) were observed. The literature review identified twenty six original studies supporting our imaging chest findings. Conclusion: The spectrum of chest imaging manifestations of COVID 19 pneumonia upon admission includes Blines and consolidations on US, consolidations and hazy increased opacities on CXR, and multifocal GGO with consolidations on CT.	0

Objectives. This research aims to understand whether the outbreak varies significantly between U.S. states and counties.
A statistical model is estimated using publicly available outbreak data in the U.S., and regional differences are statistically analyzed.
Results. There is significant variance in outbreak data between U.S. states and counties.
At the state level, the outbreak rate follows a normal distribution with an average relative growth rate of 0.197 (doubling time 3.518 days). But there is a low degree of reliability between state wide and county specific data reported (ICC = 0.169, p < 0.001), with a bias of 0.070 (standard deviation 0.062) as shown with a Bland Altman plot.
The results emphasize the need for policy makers to look at the pandemic from the smallest population subdivision possible, so that countermeasures can be implemented, and critical resources provided effectively.

In this context, users' participation in social media has become one of the main indicators of their effectiveness, highlighting the importance of analyzing which factors enhance online engagement. This research extends the number of variables identified in prior studies and analyzes 19,817 Facebook posts from 126 health organizations. Using multivariate linear regression, explanatory results show that economic and organizational attributes, and factors related to the social media posts, both contribute significantly to explain the engagement reached in social media by those organizations.

1326	"Background: On January 23, 2020, a quarantine was imposed on travel in and out of Wuhan, where the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) outbreak originated from. Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China.
We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification.
We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time.
Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days 4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019 nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4 9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification.
Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019 nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.

1328	"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronoavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2), the causative agent of COVID 19 illness, has caused over 2 million infections worldwide in four months. In SARS coronaviruses, the non structural protein 16 (nsp16) methylates the 5' end of virally encoded mRNAs to mimic cellular mRNAs, thus protecting the virus from host innate immune restriction.
We report here the high resolution structure of a ternary complex of full length nsp16 and nsp10 of SARS CoV 2 in the presence of cognate RNA substrate and a methyl donor, S adenosyl methionine. The nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer was captured in the act of 2' O methylation of the ribose sugar of the first nucleotide of SARS CoV 2 mRNA. We reveal large conformational 32 changes associated with substrate binding as the enzyme transitions from a binary to a ternary state. This structure provides new mechanistic insights into the 2' O methylation of the viral mRNA cap. We also discovered a distantly located ligand binding site unique to SARS CoV 2 that may serve as an alternative target site for antiviral development. : bioRxiv preprint of the mechanisms that permit the virus to invade cells and evade host immune restriction. SARS CoV 2 is an enveloped, positive sense single stranded β coronavirus with a large, complex RNA genome 2 . To hijack the host translation machinery for propagation, enzymes encoded by the genome of coronaviruses (CoVs) modify the 5' end of virally encoded mRNAs by creating a cap 3 . 44 RNA capping in CoVs involves activities of several nonstructural proteins (nsps): nsp13, a bifunctional RNA/NTP triphosphatase (TPase) and helicase; nsp14, a bifunctional 3'à5' mismatch exonuclease and mRNA cap guanine N7 methyltransferase; nsp16, a ribose 2' O methyltransferase; and an elusive guanylyl transferase 4 7 .
Nsp16 forms an obligatory complex with nsp10 to efficiently convert client mRNA species from the Cap 0 ( me7 GopppA1) to the Cap 1 form ( me7 GopppA1m), by methylating the ribose 2' O of the first nucleotide (usually adenosine in CoVs) of the nascent mRNA using SAM (S adenosyl 52 methionine) as the methyl donor 4, 8 . This Cap 1 form serves to avoid induction of the innate immune response 9 11 . Hence, ablation of nsp16 activity should trigger an immune response to CoV infection and limit pathogenesis 9, 10 . It has been shown that live vaccination with nsp16defective SARS CoV 1 or an immunogenic disruption of the nsp16 nsp10 interface protects mice 56 from an otherwise lethal challenge 12, 13 , making nsp16/nsp10 an attractive drug target.
Crystal structures of SARS CoV 1 nsp16/nsp10 in complex with SAM/SAH or sinefungin, but without an RNA substrate, have been reported 4, 8, 14 , so that key information about the catalytic 60 mechanism of mRNA capping in CoVs, and SARS CoV 2 in particular, is still missing. To understand the determinants of RNA cap modification and help guide the development of SARS CoV 2 antiviral therapies, we have now succeeded in solving the high resolution structure (to 1.8"	0

1336	The challenge of learning a new concept without receiving any examples beforehand is called zero shot learning (ZSL). One of the major issues in deep learning based methodologies is the requirement of feeding a vast amount of annotated and labelled images by a human to train the network model. ZSL is known for having minimal human intervention by relying only on previously known concepts and auxiliary information. It is an ever growing research area since it has human like characteristics in learning new concepts, which makes it applicable in many real world scenarios, from autonomous vehicles to surveillance systems to medical imaging and COVID 19 CT scan based diagnosis. In this paper, we present the definition of the problem, we review over fundamentals, and the challenging steps of Zero shot learning, including recent categories of solutions, motivations behind each approach, and their advantages over other categories. Inspired from different settings and extensions, we have a broaden solution called one/few shot learning. We then review thorough datasets, the variety of splits, and the evaluation protocols proposed so far. Finally, we discuss the recent applications and possible future directions of ZSL. We aim to convey a useful intuition through this paper towards the goal of learn.	0
1337	"Limited data exist on how SARS CoV 2 enters and spreads in the general population.
We used two strategies for SARS CoV 2 testing: targeted testing of high risk individuals (n=4,551) and a population screening (n=5,502). We sequenced SARS CoV 2 from 340 individuals.
RESULTS
March 22 2020, 528 had tested positive for SARS CoV 2 in the targeted testing (11.6%) and 50 in the population screening (0.9%); approximately 0.2% of the Icelandic population. Large fractions of positives had travelled outside Iceland (38.4% and 34.0%). Fewer under 10 years old were positive than those older: 2.8% vs. 12.3%
for targeted testing (P=1.6e 9) and 0.0% vs. 1.0% for population screening (P=0.031).
Fewer females were positive in the targeted testing than males (9.5% vs. 14.6%, P=6.8e 9). SARS CoV 2 came from eight clades, seven A clades and one B clade. The clade composition differed between the testing groups and changed with time. In the early targeted testing, 65.0% of clades were A2a1 and A2a2 derived from Italian and Austrian skiing areas, but in the later targeted testing went down to 30.6% and were overtaken by A1a and A2a, the most common clades in the population screening.

Objectives: A recent update of the definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) proposed an empirical classification based on ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) at ARDS onset. Since the proposal did not mandate PaO 2 /FiO 2 calculation under standardised ventilator settings (SVS), we hypothesised that a stratification based on baseline PaO 2 /FiO 2 would not provide accurate assessment of lung injury severity.
Design: A prospective, multicentre, observational study. Setting: A network of teaching hospitals. Participants: 478 patients with eligible criteria for moderate (100<PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤200) and severe (PaO 2 / FiO 2 ≤100) ARDS and followed until hospital discharge.
Interventions: We examined physiological and ventilator parameters in association with the PaO 2 /FiO 2 at ARDS onset, after 24 h of usual care and at 24 h under a SVS. At 24 h, patients were reclassified as severe, moderate, mild (200<PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤300) ARDS and non ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 >300).

1340	"Backgrounds: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city of China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019 nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.
Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019 nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (γ), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.
The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96 2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89 4.39) associated with 8 fold to 2 fold increase in the reporting rate.

We found, in our 788 confirmed COVID 19 patients, the decreased rate of severe/critical type, increased liver/kidney damage and prolonged period of nuclear acid positivity, when compared with Wuhan.
To investigate underlining mechanisms, we isolated one strain of SARS CoV 2 (ZJ01) in mild COVID 19 patient and found the existence of 35 specific gene mutation by gene alignment. Further phylogenetic analysis and RSCU heat map results suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS CoV 2. We classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (C/T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. ZJ01 has both T at those sites, becoming the only TT type currently identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1 2), which caused changes in the structure and electrostatic distribution of S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2 Furin co expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may perpetuity.

1348	We introduce a comprehensive screening platform for the COVID 19 (a.k.a., SARS CoV 2) pneumonia. The proposed AI based system works on chest x ray (CXR) images to predict whether a patient is infected with the COVID 19 disease. Although the recent international joint effort on making the availability of all sorts of open data, the public collection of CXR images is still relatively small for reliably training a deep neural network (DNN) to carry out COVID 19 prediction. To better address such inefficiency, we design a cascaded learning strategy to improve both the sensitivity and the specificity of the resulting DNN classification model. Our approach leverages a large CXR image dataset of non COVID 19 pneumonia to generalize the original well trained classification model via a cascaded learning scheme. The resulting screening system is shown to achieve good classification performance on the expanded dataset, including those newly added COVID 19 CXR images. More specifically, the proposed DNN learning proceeds in three stages. In the first stage, the model is trained to predict the mask of lung regions to emphasize the targeted areas of concern and alleviate the effect of irrelevant annotations on a CXR image. Incremental learning is then deployed in the subsequent stage so that the pre trained DNN can learn to classify the additional COVID 19 images, while retaining its classification performance on the original data. The design is to first filter out images of the normal category in the second stage and then, in the final stage, conduct fine grained classification to divide the pneumonia candidates into two specific types, namely,	0
1349	"Background
The SARS CoV 2 virus responsible for COVID 19 poses a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Despite governmental initiatives aimed at containing the spread of the disease, several countries are experiencing unmanageable increases in the demand for ICU beds, medical equipment, and larger testing capacity. Efficient COVID 19 diagnosis enables healthcare systems to provide better care for patients while protecting caregivers from the disease. However, many countries are constrained by the limited amount of test kits available, lack of equipment and trained professionals. In the case of patients visiting emergency rooms (ERs) with a suspect of COVID 19, prompt diagnosis may improve the outcome and even provide information for efficient hospital management. In such a context, a quick, inexpensive and readily available test to perform an initial triage in ERs could help to smooth patient flow, provide better patient care, and reduce the backlog of exams.
In this Case control quantitative study, we developed a strategy backed by artificial intelligence to perform an initial screening of suspect COVID 19 patients. We developed a machine learning classifier that takes widely available simple blood exams as input and classifies samples as likely to be positive (having SARS CoV 2) or negative (not having SARS CoV 2). Based on this initial classification, positive cases can be referred for further highly sensitive testing (e.g. CT scan, or specific antibodies). We used publicly available data from the Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil from 5,644 patients. Focusing on simple blood exam figures as main predictors, a sample of 599 subjects that had the fewest missing values for 16 common exams were selected. From these 599 patients, 81 tested positive for SARS CoV 2 (determined by RT PCR). Based on the reduced dataset, we built an artificial intelligence classification framework, ER CoV, aiming at determining if suspect patients arriving in ER were likely to be negative for SARS CoV 2, that is, to predict if that suspect patient is negative for COVID 19. The primary goal of this investigation is to develop a classifier with high specificity and high negative predictive values, with reasonable sensitivity.
We identified that our AI framework achieved an average specificity of 85.98% [95%CI: 84.94  86.84] and negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.92% [95%CI: 94.37%  95.37%]. Those values are completely aligned with our goal of providing an effective low cost system to triage suspect patients in ERs. As for sensitivity, our model achieved an average of 70.25% [95%CI: 66.57%  73.12%] and positive predictive value (PPV) of 44.96% [95%CI: 43.15%  46.87%]. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was 86.78% [95%CI: 85.65%  87.90%
]. An error analysis (inspection of which patients were misclassified) identified that, on average, 28% of the false negative results would have been hospitalized anyway; thus the model is making mistakes for severe cases that would not be overlooked, : medRxiv preprint partially mitigating the fact that the test is not highly sensitive. All code for our AI model, called ER CoV is publicly available at https://github.com/soares f/ER CoV.
Based on the capacity of our model to accurately predict which cases are negative from suspect patients arriving in emergency rooms, we envision that this framework may play an important role in patient triage. Probably the most important outcome is related to testing availability, which at this point is extremely low in many countries. Considering the achieved specificity, we could reduce by at least 90% the number of SARS CoV 2 tests performed in emergency rooms, with around 5% chance of getting a false negative. The second important outcome is related to patient management in hospitals. Patients predicted as positive by our framework could be immediately separated from other patients while waiting for the results of confirmatory tests. This could reduce the spread rate within hospitals since in many of them all suspect cases are kept in the same ward. In Brazil, where the data was collected, rate infection is starting to quickly spread and the lead time of a SARS CoV 2 may be up to 2 weeks."	0
1350	The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) exemplifies the critical need for accurate and rapid diagnostic assays to prompt clinical and public health interventions. Currently, several quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR) assays are being used by clinical, research, and public health laboratories. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to be used as assay standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used (1) RNA transcript standards, (2) full length SARS CoV 2 RNA, (3) pre COVID 19 nasopharyngeal swabs, and (4) clinical samples from COVID 19 patients to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of the qRT PCR primer probe sets. We show that all primer probe sets can be used to detect SARS CoV 2 at 500 virus copies per reaction, except for the RdRp SARSr (Charité) confirmatory primer probe set which has low sensitivity. Our findings characterize the limitations of currently used primer probe sets and can assist other laboratories in selecting appropriate assays for the detection of SARS CoV 2.	0

The patients with COVID 19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia.
RESULTS
Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID 19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34 54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia , 69 hypokalemia , and 67 normokalemia patients.
Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P>0.05). Body temperature, CK, CK MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K   loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia. 1 severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded recovery."	0
1353	This paper highlights the enormous economic and social impact of COVID 19 with respect to articles that have either prognosticated such a large scale event, and its economic consequences, or have assessed the impacts of other epidemics and pandemics. A consideration of possible impacts of COVID 19 on financial markets and institutions, either directly or indirectly, is briefly outlined by drawing on a variety of literatures. A consideration of the characteristics of COVID 19, along with what research suggests have been the impacts of other past events that in some ways roughly parallel COVID 19, points toward avenues of future investigation.	0
1354	The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV) emphasizes the importance of detecting novel viruses and predicting their risks of infecting people. In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019 nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), Bat SARS like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019 nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019 nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019 nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019 nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it. One Sentence Summary: It is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input.	0

Background: Respiratory and faecal aerosols play a suspected role in transmitting the SARS CoV 2 virus. We performed extensive environmental sampling in a dedicated hospital building for Covid 19 patients in both toilet and non toilet environments, and analysed the associated environmental factors.
We collected data of the Covid 19 patients. 107 surface samples, 46 air samples, two exhaled condensate samples, and two expired air samples were collected were collected within and beyond the four three bed isolation rooms. We reviewed the environmental design of the building and the cleaning routines. We conducted field measurement of airflow and CO2 concentrations.
The 107 surface samples comprised 37 from toilets, 34 from other surfaces in isolation rooms (ventilated at 30 60 L/s), and 36 from other surfaces outside isolation rooms in the hospital. Four of these samples were positive, namely two ward door handles, one bathroom toilet seat cover and one bathroom door handle; and three were weakly positive, namely one bathroom toilet seat, one bathroom washbasin tap lever and one bathroom ceiling exhaust louvre. One of the 46 air samples was weakly positive, and this was a corridor air sample. The two exhaled condensate samples and the two expired air samples were negative.
Interpretation: The faecal derived aerosols in patients' toilets contained most of the detected SARS CoV 2 virus in the hospital, highlighting the importance of surface and hand hygiene for intervention."	0

1360	"Although the rapidly rising transmission trend of COVID 19 in Wuhan has been controlled in late February 2020, the outbreak still caused a global pandemic afterward. Understanding Wuhan's COVID 19 transmission dynamics and the effects of prevention approaches is of significant importance for containing virus global transmission. However, most of the recent studies focused on the early outbreaks without considering improvements in diagnostic capability and effects of prevention measures together, thus the estimated results may only reflect the facts in a given period of time.
We constructed a stochastic susceptible exposed infected quarantined recovered (SEIQR) model, embedding with latent periods under different prevention measures and proportions of documented infections to characterize the Wuhan COVID 19 transmission cross different stages of the outbreak. The epidemiological parameters were estimated using a particle filtering approach.
Our model successfully reproduced the dynamics of the Wuhan local epidemic with two peaks on February 4 and February 12 separately. Prevention measures determined the time of reaching the first peak and caused an 87% drop in the R t from 3.09 (95% CI, 2.10 to 3.63) to 0.41 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.66). An improved diagnostic capability created the second peak and increased the number of documented infections. The proportion of documented infections changed from 23% (95% CI, 20% to 26%) to 37% (95% CI, 33% to 41%) when the detection kits were released after January 26, and later up to 73% (95% CI, 64% to 80%) after the diagnostic criteria were improved."	0

1363	"Hospital palliative care is an essential part of the COVID 19 response but data are lacking. We identified symptom burden, management, response to treatment, and outcomes for a case series of 101 in patients with confirmed COVID 19 referred to hospital palliative care. Patients (64 male, median [IQR] age 82 [72 89] years, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index 6 [2 10], Australian modified Karnofsky Performance Status 20 [10 20]), were most frequently referred for end of life care or symptom control. Median [IQR] days from hospital admission to referral was 4 [1 12] days. Most prevalent symptoms (n) were breathlessness (67), agitation (43), drowsiness (36), pain (23) and delirium (24). Fifty eight patients were prescribed a subcutaneous infusion. Frequently used medicines (median maximum dose/24h) were opioids (morphine, 10 30mg; fentanyl, 100 200mcg; alfentanil 500 1000 mcg) and midazolam (10 20mg). Infusions were assessed as at least partially effective for 40/58 patients, while 13 patients died before review. Patients spent a median [IQR] of 2 [1 4] days under the palliative care team, who made 3 [2 5] contacts across patient, family and clinicians. At March 30 2020, 75 patients had died, 13 been discharged back to team, home or hospice, and 13 continued to receive inpatient palliative care. Palliative care is an essential component to the COVID 19 response, and teams must rapidly adapt with new ways of working.
Breathlessness and agitation are common but respond well to opioids and benzodiazepines.
Availability of subcutaneous infusion pumps is essential. An international minimum dataset for palliative care would accelerate finding answers to new questions as the COVID 19 pandemic develops.
In this first case series of 101 patients with COVID 19 referred to palliative care, input was brief; most patients died in <3 days. The most common symptoms were breathlessness and agitation, controlled in most cases using relatively small doses of opioid and benzodiazepine, delivered by subcutaneous infusion. To meet the rapidly growing need for palliative care, services must adapt with training and guidance for non specialists will help ensure symptoms are addressed promptly."	0
1364	"In this manuscript, we showed a statistically significant difference of the doubling times of the death toll between the group of countries with national universal Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination and the group without it for recent years. Based on a statistical test, the distributions of the doubling time of these two groups were significantly different (p=0.007). Miller et al. reported the relationship between BCG vaccination and mortality for COVID 19 based on deaths per million inhabitants. However, they did not take into account the differences in COVID 19 detection rates among the countries and the epidemic stages of the countries. Therefore we used a doubling time of the death toll as a more stable indicator instead. We also investigated the dependency of the BCG strains. Among the 42 BCG vaccinated countries, the median doubling time of the eight countries using ""Tokyo 172 1"" strain at least partially (Japan, Iraq, Malaysia, South Korea, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) was 7.2 days, and that of the other 34 vaccinated countries was 5.5 days. Their distributions were also significantly different (p=0.026).
The non specific effects of Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination have been enthusiastically discussed. 1 Miller et al. reported the relationship between BCG vaccination and mortality for COVID 19 based on deaths per million inhabitants. 2 However they did not take into account the differences in COVID 19 detection rates among the countries and the epidemic stages of the countries. Therefore we used a doubling time (DT) of the death toll as a more stable indicator.
First, we investigated the DT of COVID 19 deaths in 57 countries (source: Our World in Data, 3 as of 20 April 2020). We defined the baseline date of each country as the date when summed fatalities of at least ten people was first observed in the country. We covered all countries that have at least 10 day observation period and had a population 4 of more than 1 million. To exclude the effect of social interventions, the death toll data of the country was truncated by 30 days after the baseline date (for 20 countries among 57).
Next, we surveyed the national BCG vaccination policies of each country (sources: BCG Atlas, 5 WHO UNICEF report, 6 and other 20 papers 7 26 ). The 57 countries were divided into two groups based on whether the majority of the population between the ages of 0 and 39 was vaccinated (""BCG"") or not (""non BCG""). BCG vaccination records, especially cover rates, are reliable only for the last few decades for several countries."	0

Historia de la dermatología Aportaciones de la anatomía patoló gica en el diagnó stico de las infecciones cutá neas: una perspectiva histó rica Contribution of histopathology to the diagnosis of cutaneous infections: A historical perspective El auge de las etiologías infecciosas en el siglo XIX Todas las á reas de la medicina han experimentado un espectacular cambio en las ú ltimas dé cadas, y la anatomía patoló gica no es ajena a ellas. En concreto, en el á rea a la que se refiere este artículo  las enfermedades infecciosas se ha confirmado la naturaleza infecciosa de muchos cuadros que en siglos pasados eran de etiología desconocida, así como se ha consolidado el diagnó stico certero de los mismos.
Recapitulando sobre las contribuciones de la anatomía patoló gica en las infecciones desde sus orígenes, habría que retrotraerse al conocimiento sobre el cará cter contagioso de las mismas, que era conocido ya desde los tiempos de la medicina clá sica, y que, por ejemplo, fue reflejado en los textos bíblicos sobre la naturaleza de la lepra. Aunque las enfermedades fueron conocidas en sus aspectos epidemioló gicos, clínicos, e incluso higié nicos, terapé uticos, y preventivos, los etioló gicos se resistieron en gran medida hasta el siglo XIX.
La sífilis es un buen ejemplo de ello. Desde muy temprano en la historia de la medicina se reconocieron la enfermedad y sus manifestaciones, ejemplificadas de modo extremo en el caso de sífilis terciaria mostrado en el libro VIII de la copia De Recó ndita Abscessuum Natura de Marco Aurelio Severino (1632) ( fig. 1 ).

In this study, we assessed currently marketed intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) products for antibodies against human common coronaviruses that may cross react with the SARS CoV 2 virus.
Methods: Gamunex ®  C and Flebogamma ® DIF (Grifols) IVIG were tested against several betacoronaviruses antigens using ELISA techniques: HCoV (undetermined antigen), HCoV HKU1 (N protein), SARS CoV (culture lysate), MERS CoV (N protein; S1 protein/RBD; S protein), and SARS CoV 2 (S1 protein). Results: Both IVIG products showed consistent reactivity to components of the tested viruses. Positive cross reactivity was seen in SARS CoV, MERS CoV, and SARS CoV 2. For SARS CoV 2, positive reactivity was observed at IVIG concentrations ranging from 100 µg/mL with Gamunex C to 1 mg/mL with Flebogamma 5% DIF. Conclusion:
Gamunex C and Flebogamma DIF IVIG contain antibodies reacting against SARS CoV 2 antigens. These preparations may be useful for immediate treatment of COVID 19 disease."	1
1367	"COVID 19 has become a global pandemic that threatens millions of people worldwide.
There is an urgent call for developing effective drugs against the virus (SARS CoV 2) causing this disease. The main protease of SARS CoV 2, 3C like protease (3CL pro ), is highly conserved across coronaviruses and is essential for the maturation process of viral polyprotein. Scutellariae radix (Huangqin in Chinese), the root of Scutellaria baicalensis has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat viral infection related symptoms. The extracts of S. baicalensis have exhibited broad spectrum antiviral activities. We studied the anti SARS CoV 2 activity of S. baicalensis and its ingredient compounds. We found that the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis inhibits SARS CoV 2 3CL pro activity in vitro and the replication of SARS CoV 2 in Vero cells with an EC50 of 0.74 g/ml. Among the major components of S. baicalensis, baicalein strongly inhibits SARS CoV 2 3CL pro activity with an IC50 of 0.39 M. We further identified four baicalein analogue compounds from other herbs that inhibit SARS CoV 2 3CL pro activity at microM concentration. Our study demonstrates that the extract of S. baicalensis has effective anti SARS CoV 2 activity and baicalein and analogue compounds are strong SARS CoV 2 3CL pro inhibitors. author/funder.

1373	"Objective: The lack of resources and coordination to face the coronavirus epidemic raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we still have memories of the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims to propose guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS CoV epidemic in France. Methods: The authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and in local initiatives in France. Results : We identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which are risk factors for severe covid 19 infection; 2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of ""COVID  units"". These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical checkups and close psychological support. Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho education strategies;
developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, Page 3 of 24 J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 3 prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion: French mental healthcare is now facing a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the confinement of the general population."	0

Tegument Complexes in the Tumor Herpesvirus KSHV Graphical Abstract Highlights d Genome packing portal and capsid associated tegument complexes (CATCs) resolved d Partial and asymmetric CATC occupancy introduces structural variability d CATC binding introduces 120 counterclockwise rotation of triplex Ta on the capsid d Structure based mutageneses reveal binding hotspot for antiviral development SUMMARY
Assembly of Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) begins at a bacteriophage like portal complex that nucleates formation of an icosahedral capsid with capsid associated tegument complexes (CATCs) and facilitates translocation of an $150 kb dsDNA genome, followed by acquisition of a pleomorphic tegument and envelope. Because of deviation from icosahedral symmetry, KSHV portal and tegument structures have largely been obscured in previous studies. Using symmetry relaxed cryo EM, we determined the in situ structure of the KSHV portal and its interactions with surrounding capsid proteins, CATCs, and the terminal end of KSHV's dsDNA genome. Our atomic models of the portal and capsid/CATC, together with visualization of CATCs' variable occupancy and alternate orientation of CATC interacting vertex triplexes, suggest a mechanism whereby the portal orchestrates procapsid formation and asymmetric long range determination of CATC attachment during DNA packaging prior to pleomorphic tegumentation/envelopment. Structure based mutageneses confirm that a triplex deep binding groove for CATCs is a hotspot that holds promise for antiviral development."	0
1376	The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus infection that were confirmed outside of China provide an opportunity to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in mainland China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic potential of COVID 19 in the early stage of the epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naïve population. We modeled epidemic growth either from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December, 2019 (Scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January, 2020. The cumulative incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% CI: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%, 7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on these results, we argued that the current COVID 19 epidemic has a substantial potential for causing a pandemic. The proposed approach provides insights in early risk assessment using publicly available data.	0

1378	"The ongoing novel coronavirus disease pandemic has rapidly spread in early 2020, causing tens of thousands of deaths, over a million cases and widespread socioeconomic disruption. With no vaccine available and numerous national healthcare systems reaching or exceeding capacity, interventions to limit transmission are urgently needed. While there is broad agreement that travel restrictions and closure of non essential businesses and schools are beneficial in limiting local and regional spread, recommendations around the use of face masks for the general population are less consistent internationally. In this study, we examined the role of face masks in mitigating the spread of COVID 19 in the general population, using epidemic models to estimate the total reduction of infections and deaths under various scenarios. In particular, we examined the optimal deployment of face masks when resources are limited, and explored a range of supply and demand dynamics. We found that face masks, even with a limited protective effect, can reduce infections and deaths, and can delay the peak time of the epidemic. We consistently found that a random distribution of masks in the population was a suboptimal strategy when resources were limited. Prioritizing coverage among the elderly was more beneficial, while allocating a proportion of available resources for diagnosed infected cases provided further mitigation under a range of scenarios. In summary, face mask use, particularly for a pathogen with relatively common asymptomatic carriage, can effectively provide some mitigation of transmission, while balancing provision between vulnerable healthy persons and symptomatic persons can optimize mitigation efforts when resources are limited.
The rapid global spread of SARS CoV 2 and the resulting coronavirus disease pandemic has led to urgent efforts to contain and mitigate transmission, leading to significant and widespread socioeconomic disruption. As of April 3rd 2020, over one million cases have been reported worldwide, as well as over 60,000 deaths, with ongoing spread in most parts of the world [1]. While infection is frequently asymptomatic, or associated with only mild symptoms in many people [2, 3] , it can cause severe and life threatening illness in the immunocompromised and the elderly, with a case fatality ratio of over 10% in the latter group [3] [4] [5] . The rapid spread of the virus has raised concerns that healthcare systems lack sufficient resources and will be unable to bear the burden of accommodating patients suffering from COVID 19, resulting in significantly increased morbidity and mortality.

1379	Finding vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for global pandemic of virus diseases (such as the ongoing COVID 19) requires rapid analysis, annotation and evaluation of metagenomic fast alignment free techniques for sequence analysis. Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences. In 2013, our research group (Nagaraj et al., Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 222(3 4), 2013) has proposed a novel measure known as Effort To Compress (ETC) based on the notion of compression complexity to capture the information content of sequences. In this study, we propose a compression complexity based distance measure for automatic identification of SARS coronavirus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments of nucleotide sequences. We also demonstrate that our proposed method can correctly distinguish SARS CoV 2 from SARS CoV 1 viruses by analyzing very short segments of nucleotide sequences. This work could be extended further to enable medical practitioners in automatically identifying and characterizing SARS coronavirus strain in a fast and efficient fashion using short and/or incomplete segments of nucleotide sequences. Potentially, the need for sequence assembly can be circumvented.	1
1380	"We dissect the mechanism of SARS CoV 2 in human lung host from the initial phase of receptor binding to viral replication machinery. We constructed two independent lung protein interactome to reveal the signaling process on receptor activation and host protein hijacking machinery in the pathogenesis of virus. Further, we test the functional role of the hubs derived from both interactome. Most hubs proteins were differentially regulated on SARS CoV 2 infection. Also, the proteins of viral replication hubs were related with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection in the risk individual. Additionally, the hub proteins were closely linked with other viral infection, including MERS and HCoVs which suggest similar infection pattern in SARS CoV 2. We identified five interconnecting cascades between hubs of both networks that show the preparation of optimal environment in the host for viral replication process upon receptor attachment.
Interestingly, we propose that seven potential miRNAs, targeting the intermediate phase that connects receptor and viral replication process a better choice as a drug for SARS CoV 2."	0
1381	Direct RNA sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION characterised the transcriptome of SARS CoV 2 grown in Vero E6 cells. This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS CoV 2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS CoV 2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.	0
1382	Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) infected pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for diagnosing and predicting prognosis. We retrospective studied 27 consecutive patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years (IQR 47 69). 17 patients discharged in recovered condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63 73) vs 55 (IQR 35 60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7 13) vs 12 (IQR 11 43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the prediction of mortality. 2019 nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality.	0

In the model, the 14 day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of AT and ARH, and their interaction were included with time trend and health seeking behavior adjusted. Their spatial distributions were visualized. AT and ARH showed significantly negative associations with COVID 19 with a significant interaction between them (0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.004 0.07) in Hubei. Every 1°C increase in the AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in the range from 67% to 85.5%. Every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was in the range from 5.04°C to 8.2°C. However, these associations were not consistent throughout Mainland China."	0

This notion is not in conflict with recent knowledge of the heterogeneity, development, and migratory habits of B cell subpopulations.18,39 There is no doubt about the presence of circulating tumorigenic cells in mice bearing myeloma tumours. However, the exact identity of these cells is not known. The simultaneous detection of malignant change and idiotypic structures in circulating lymphocytes is difficult. Nevertheless, lymphocytoid cells bearing some tumour cell markers have been demonstrated. The number of lymphocytes whose SIg was altered by tumour R.N.A.3' is probably much greater than the number of tumorigenic cells estimated in other experiments.26 Although it is highly likely that SIg id  neoplastic stem cells circulate in human myeloma, the bulk of the SIg id  lymphocyte population may be partially differentiated and therefore relatively benign. In addition, many circulating tumorigenic cells could be in a non growth phase or equivalent state, and probably very few of those which are in the cell cycle successfully initiate a focus of tumour because of immunological inhibition and/or ecotactic preference.
Definitive experiments are needed to detect and isolate myeloma CFU c stem cells from human peripheral blood, and attempts should be made to propagate these in nude mice. Further characterisation of peripheral lymphocytes from myeloma patients must be undertaken because of their possible value in diagnosis and therapy.

1385	"COVID 19 is a novel coronavirus that was emerged in December 2019 within Wuhan, China. As the crisis of its serious increasing dynamic outbreak in all parts of the globe, the forecast maps and analysis of confirmed cases (CS) becomes a vital great changeling task. In this study, a new forecasting model is presented to analyze and forecast the CS of COVID 19 for the coming days based on the reported data since 22 Jan 2020. The proposed forecasting model, named ISACL MFNN, integrates an improved interior search algorithm (ISA) based on chaotic learning (CL) strategy into a multi layer feed forward neural network (MFNN). The ISACL incorporates the CL strategy to enhance the performance of ISA and avoid the trapping in the local optima. By this methodology, it is intended to train the neural network by tuning its parameters to optimal values and thus achieving high accuracy level regarding forecasted results. The ISACL MFNN model is investigated on the official data of the COVID 19 reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyze the confirmed cases for the upcoming days. The performance regarding the proposed forecasting model is validated and assessed by introducing some indices including the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the comparisons with other optimization algorithms are presented.
The proposed model is investigated in the most affected countries (i.e., USA, Italy, and Spain).

1386	The COVID 19 pandemic poses two challenges to healthcare providers. Firstly, a high number of patients require hospital admission. Second, a high number of healthcare staff are either falling ill with the infection, or self isolating. This poses significant problems for the staffing of busy hospital departments. We have created a simple model which allows users to stress test their rota. The model provides plots of staff availability over time using either a constant infection rate, or a changing infection rate fitted to population based infection curves. It allows users to gauge the extent and timing of dips in staff availability. The basic constant infection rate model is available within an on line web application (https://covid19.shef.ac.uk). As for any model, our work is imperfect. However, it allows a range of infection rates to be simulated quickly across different work patterns. We hope it will be useful to those planning staff deployment and will stimulate debate epidemic.	0

Little is known about changes in levels of psychological impact, stress, anxiety and depression during this pandemic. This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice  during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID 19. There were 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities (1210 first survey respondents, 861 second survey respondents; 333 respondents participated in both). Psychological impact and mental health status were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 21), respectively. IES R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS  21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. This study found that there was a statistically significant longitudinal reduction in mean IES R scores (from 32.98 to 30.76, p<0.01) after 4 weeks. Nevertheless, the mean IES R score of the first and secondsurvey respondents were above the cut off scores (>24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant. During the initial evaluation, moderateto severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%, 28.8% and 16.5%, respectively and there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (p>0.05). Protective factors included high level of confidence in doctors, perceived survival likelihood and low risk of contracting COVID 19, satisfaction with health information, personal precautionary measures. As countries around the world brace for an escalation in cases, Governments should focus on effective methods of disseminating unbiased COVID 19 knowledge, teaching correct containment methods, ensuring availability of essential services/commodities, and providing sufficient financial support. 4"	0

1393	This paper examines the role of various socioeconomic factors in mediating the local and cross city transmissions of the novel coronavirus 2019 in China. We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID 19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global efforts in containment of COVID 19.	0

No specific treatment has been established against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) so far. Therefore, it is urgently needed to identify effective antiviral agents for the treatment of this disease, and several approved drugs such as lopinavir have been evaluated. Here, we report that nelfinavir, an HIV 1 protease inhibitor, potently inhibits replication of SARS CoV 2. The effective concentrations for 50% and 90% inhibition (EC50 and EC90) peak serum concentrations of nelfinavir were three to six times higher than EC50 of this drug. These results suggest that nelfinavir is a potential candidate drug for the treatment of COVID 19 and should be assessed in patients with COVID 19.

1397	In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, called COVID 19, was discovered in Wuhan, China, and has spread to different cities in China as well as to 24 other countries. The number of confirmed cases is increasing daily and reached 34,598 on 8 February 2020. In the current study, we present a new forecasting model to estimate and forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID 19 in the upcoming ten days based on the previously confirmed cases recorded in China. The proposed model is an improved adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using an enhanced flower pollination algorithm (FPA) by using the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). In general, SSA is employed to improve FPA to avoid its drawbacks (i.e., getting trapped at the local optima). The main idea of the proposed model, called FPASSA ANFIS, is to improve the performance of ANFIS by determining the parameters of ANFIS using FPASSA. The FPASSA ANFIS model is evaluated using the World Health Organization (WHO) official data of the outbreak of the COVID 19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days. More so, the FPASSA ANFIS model is compared to several existing models, and it showed better performance in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), coefficient of determination (R 2 ), and computing time. Furthermore, we tested the proposed model using two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in two performances.	0
1398	The recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID 19) is of particular concern, given vulnerability to respiratory problems among PWID in the UK, many of whom also smoke (crack cocaine, heroin, tobacco) and have a much higher incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than the general population [4]. This increased risk among the unstably housed may be a consequence of inability to maintain safe and hygienic injection practices when injecting in public places, where injections may be hurried, with a lack of clean surfaces, poor lighting and difficulties in accessing clean water to use as a drug solvent [11–15].

1399	We present a simple operational nowcasting/forecasting scheme based on a joint state/parameter estimate of the COVID 19 epidemic at national or regional scale, performed by assimilating the time series of reported daily death numbers into a simple SEIR model. This system generates estimates of the current reproductive rate, R t , together with predictions of future daily deaths and clearly outperforms a number of alternative forecasting systems that have been presented recently. Our current 5 (14th April 2020) estimates for R t are, respectively, UK 0.49 (0.0  1.02), Spain 0.55 (0.33  0.77), Italy 0.90 (0.74  1.06) and France 0.67 (0.40  0.94) (mean and 95% credible intervals). Thus, we believe that the epidemics have been successfully suppressed in each of these countries, with high probability. Our approach is trivial to set up for any region and generates results in a few minutes on a laptop. We believe it would be straightforward to set up equivalent frameworks using more complex and realistic models, and hope that some experts in further.	0
1400	Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) have been isolated from humans so far. Among them, three emerging pathogenic CoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV), and a newly identified CoV (2019 nCoV), once caused or continue to cause severe infections in humans, posing significant threats to global public health. SARS CoV infection in humans (with about 10% case fatality rate) was first reported from China in 2002, while MERS CoV infection in humans (with about 34.4% case fatality rate) was first reported from Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 2019 nCoV was first reported from China in December 2019, and is currently infecting more than 70000 people (with about 2.7% case fatality rate). Both SARS CoV and MERS CoV are zoonotic viruses, using bats as their natural reservoirs, and then transmitting through intermediate hosts, leading to human infections. Nevertheless, the intermediate host for 2019 nCoV is still under investigation and the vaccines against this new CoV have not been available. Although a variety of vaccines have been developed against infections of SARS CoV and MERS CoV, none of them has been approved for use in humans. In this review, we have described the structure and function of key proteins of emerging human CoVs, overviewed the current vaccine types to be developed against SARS CoV and MERS CoV, and summarized recent advances in subunit vaccines against these two pathogenic human CoVs. These subunit vaccines are introduced on the basis of full length spike (S) protein, receptorbinding domain (RBD), non RBD S protein fragments, and non S structural proteins, and the potential factors affecting these subunit vaccines are also illustrated. Overall, this review will be helpful for rapid design and development of vaccines against the new 2019 nCoV and any future CoVs with pandemic potential.

1402	Background and objectives: SARS CoV 2 is a new type of coronavirus that can affect people and causes respiratory disease, COVID 19. It is affecting the entire planet and we focus in Spain, where the first case was detected at the end of January 2020 and in recent weeks it has increased in many cases. We need predictive models in order to be efficient and take actions. The general goal of this work is present a new model of SARS CoV 2 to predict different scenarios of accumulated cases in Spain. Material and methods: In this short report is used a model proposed previously, based on a parametric model Weibull and in a the library BDSbiost3 developed in R to infer and predict different scenarios of the evolution of SARS CoV 2 for the accumulated cases in Spain after the spread that affects Spain detected at the end of January of this year. Results: In the analyses presented, projective curves have been generated for the evolution of accumulated cases in which they reach about 4,000 cases or about 15,000 cases, for which the lines of the day in which the value for 90 will be reached can be seen vertically 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases, from that day they will begin to descend or remain the same), that is why the vertical lines would indicate the brake of the disease. For the worst case scenario, it takes 118, 126 or 142 days to reach the maximum number of cases (n = 15,000) to reach 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases), respectively. This means translated in a time scale that in the worst case the virus will not stop its progress, in Spain, until summer 2020, hopefully before. Comments and conclusions: This model could be used to plan the resources and see if the policies or means dedicated to the virus are slowing the progress of the virus or it is necessary to implement others that are more effective, and can also validate a method for future outbreaks of diseases such as these.	0

Chinese herbal medicine Huo Gu formula Osteonecrosis of the femoral head SARS Steroid related osteonecrosis
Purpose: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) reminds us of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, and up to date, corticosteroid is commonly administrated to severe patients with COVID 19. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common disabling complication among convalescent SARS patients who received corticosteroid therapy. In China, a considerable number of convalescent SARS patients with steroid associated ONFH had undergone conservative treatment by traditional Chinese medicine, and this study aims to evaluate the long term results of a spleen invigorating Huo Gu formula (HGF) therapy in these patients. Participants and methods: A total of 33 convalescent SARS patients (9 males and 24 females) with bilateral steroidassociated ONFH (66 hips) were enrolled in this study. All patients received oral HGF therapy for 6 months when they were confirmed the diagnosis of steroid associated ONFH. They had been regularly followed up at an interval of 1 year. Harris hip score and medical imaging modalities, including plain radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, were performed to evaluate the outcomes. Results: Based on average 14 years of follow up of HGF therapy (ranging from 6 to 16 years), 38 hips (57%) among the 66 hips developed definite osteoarthritis, and 14 hips (26%) in 53 precollapse hips (Association Research Circulation Osseous [ARCO] Stage I or II) progressed to femoral head collapse (ARCO Stage III or IV). Only five patients (also 5 hips) underwent total hip arthroplasty, and the mean hip survival time was over 15 years by the Kaplan Meier analysis. We observed a mean Harris hip score of 63 points, which represented the reserve of 55% in pain score and 70% in physical function score. The severity of groin pain was not correlated to the severity of osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Chinese herbal HGF therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on preventing femoral head collapse, delaying total hip arthroplasty, and maintaining physical function in the treatment of steroid associated ONFH. HGF therapy might be therefore a good alternative for the treatment of steroid associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infection diseases."	0
1407	"There had been a preliminary occurrence of human to human transmissions between healthcare workers (HCWs), but risk factors in the susceptibility for COVID 19, and infection patterns among HCWs have largely remained unknown.
Retrospective data collection on demographics, lifestyles, contact status with infected subjects for 118 HCWs (include 12 COVID 19 HCWs) from a single center. Sleep quality and working pressure were evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and The Nurse Stress Index (NSI), respectively. Follow up duration was from Dec 25, 2019, to Feb 15, 2020. Risk factors and transmission models of COVID 19 among HCWs were analyzed and constructed. Findings A high proportion of COVID 19 HCWs had engaged in night shift work (75.0% vs. 40.6%) and felt they were working under pressure (66.7% vs. 32.1%) than uninfected HCWs.

1413	"A recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2), the causative agent of COVID 19, has spread rapidly all over the world. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is another deadly virus and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Rapid and early detection of these viruses will facilitate early intervention and reduce disease transmission risk. Here, we present an All In One Dual CRISPR Cas12a (termed ""AIOD CRISPR"") assay method for simple, rapid, ultrasensitive, one pot, and visual detection of coronavirus SARS CoV 2 and HIV virus. In our AIOD CRISPR assay, a pair of crRNAs was introduced to initiate dual CRISPR Cas12a detection and improve detection sensitivity. The AIOD CRISPR assay system was successfully utilized to detect nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) of SARS CoV 2 and HIV with a sensitivity of few copies. Also, it was evaluated by detecting HIV 1 RNA extracted from human plasma samples, achieving a comparable sensitivity with real time RT PCR method. Thus, our method has a great potential for developing next generation point of care molecular diagnostics."	0
1414	Two clusters of the coronavirus disease 2019 were confirmed in Hokkaido, Japan, in February 2020. To capture these clusters, this study employed web search query logs and user location information from smartphones. Initially, we anonymously identified the smartphone users who used a web search engine (i.e., Yahoo! JAPAN Search) to search for COVID 19 or its symptoms. We regarded these searchers as web searchers who were suspicious of their own COVID 19 infection (WSSCI). Subsequently, we extracted the location of WSSCI via the smartphone application and compared the spatiotemporal distribution of WSSCI with the actual location of the two known clusters. In the early stage of cluster development, we can confirm several WSSCI. However, our approach was accurate only in that stage and became biased after the public announcement of the cluster development. When other cluster related resources, such as detailed population statistics, are not available, the proposed metric can capture hints of emerging clusters.	0

This paper uses data on all mobile phone users, from one major Swedish mobile phone network, to examine the impact of the Coronavirus outbreak under the Swedish mild recommendations and restrictions regime on individual mobility and if changes in geographical mobility vary over different socio economic strata. Having access to data for January March in both 2019 and 2020 enables the estimation of causal effects of the COVID 19 outbreak by adopting a Difference in Differences research design. The paper reaches four main conclusions: (i) The daytime population in residential areas increased significantly (64 percent average increase); (ii) The daytime presence in industrial and commercial areas decreased significantly (33 percent average decrease);
(iii) The distance individuals move from their homes during a day was substantially reduced (38 percent decrease in the maximum distance moved and 36 percent increase in share of individuals"	0
1416	"Most of epidemiological models applied for COVID 19 do not consider heterogeneity in infectiousness and impact of superspreaders, despite the broad viral loading distributions amongst COVID 19 positive people (1  10 6 per mL). Also, mass group testing is not used regardless to existing shortage of tests. I propose new strategy for early detection of superspreaders with reasonable number of RT PCR tests, which can dramatically mitigate development COVID 19 pandemic and even turn it endemic.
I used stochastic social epidemiological SEIAR model, where S suspected, E exposed, I infectious, Aadmitted (confirmed COVID 19 positive, who are admitted to hospital or completely isolated), Rrecovered. The model was applied to real COVID 19 dynamics in London, Moscow and New York City.
Viral loading data measured by RT PCR were fitted by broad log normal distribution, which governed high importance of superspreaders. The proposed full scale model of a metropolis shows that top 10% spreaders (100  higher viral loading than median infector) transmit 45% of new cases. Rapid isolation of superspreaders leads to 4 8 fold mitigation of pandemic depending on applied quarantine strength and amount of currently infected people. High viral loading allows efficient group ""matrix"" pool testing of population focused on detection of the superspreaders requiring remarkably small amount of tests."	0

Moreover, it is gratifying that a number of people who trained with me are contributing to the effort to fight this virus, including Scott Hughes (New York City Office of Safety and Emergency Preparedness & Response) and Kristine Rose (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) as well as several others carrying out bench research on SARS CoV 2.	1
1418	We model and forecast the early evolution of the COVID 19 pandemic in Brazil using Brazilian recent data from February 25, 2020 to March 30, 2020. This early period accounts for unawareness of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease in a new territory, sub notification of the real numbers of infected people and the timely introduction of social distancing policies to flatten the spread of the disease. We use two variations of the SIR model and we include a parameter that comprises the effects of social distancing measures. Short and Long terms forecasts show that the social distancing policy imposed by the government is able to flatten the pattern of infection of the COVID 19. However, our results also show that if this policy does not last enough time, it is only able to shift the peak of infection into the future keeping the value of the peak in almost the same value. Furthermore, our long term simulations forecast the optimal date to end the policy. Finally, we show that the proportion of asymptomatic individuals affects the amplitude of the peak population.	0
1419	As an emerging infectious disease, the 2019 coronavirus disease has developed into a global pandemic. During the initial spreading of the virus in China, we demonstrated the ensemble Kalman filter performed well as a short term predictor of the daily cases reported in Wuhan City. Second, we used an individual level network based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province at its early stage and examine the effectiveness of non pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID 19 transmission with non Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemic trajectories, compared to those obtained with Markov processes. Since recent studies show that COVID 19 epidemiological parameters do not follow exponential distributions leading to Markov processes, future works need to focus on non Markovian models to better capture the COVID 19 spreading trajectories. In addition, shortening the infectious period via early case identification and isolation can slow the epidemic spreading significantly.	1
1420	"With the emergence of 4 rd generation transmission, the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 has entered a new period.
We aimed to report several changes in the clinical characteristics at admission of patients with COVID 19.
Clinical records and laboratory results of patients suffering from COVID 19
were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the changes in characteristics at the onset of illness.
. Of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from January 16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29. Patients were admitted with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%] of 31), and myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31), before January 23. More patients (10 [32.3%] of 31) admitted before January 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a smaller proportion (4 [6.9%] of 58) of the patients admitted after January 23.
Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness, were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the group admitted before January 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of 24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21) counts and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA, 18 [75%] of 24).
Conclusions. The initial symptoms of recently infected patients seem more insidious, indicating that the new coronavirus may gradually evolve into a virus similar to influenza and latent in asymptomatic carriers for a long time."	1

1422	"Background: Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) infected pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for diagnosing and predicting prognosis.
Purpose: To summarize the clinical and radiologic characteristics of NCIP cases and analyze the association of radiologic findings with mortality cases.
We retrospective studied 27 consecutive patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients was evaluated.
Results: 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years . 17 patients discharged in recovered condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63 73) vs 55 (IQR 35 60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7 13) vs 12 (IQR 11 43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025).
An optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the prediction of mortality.
Conclusions: 2019 nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality."	0
1423	There are significant misconceptions and many obstacles in the way of illuminating the epidemiological and clinical aspects of COVID 19 as a new emerging epidemic. In addition, usefulness of some evidence published in the context of the recent epidemic for decision making in clinic as well as public health is questionable. However, misinterpreting or ignoring strong evidence in clinical practice and public health probably results in less effective and somehow more harmful decisions for individuals as well as subgroups in general populations of countries in the initial stages of this epidemic. Accordingly, our narrative review appraised epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease including genetic diversity of coronavirus genus, mode of transmission, incubation period, infectivity, pathogenicity, virulence, immunogenicity, diagnosis, surveillance, clinical case management and also successful measures for	1

1425	We predict the evolution of the COVID 19 pandemic in several countries by using a regressionbased predictive model. In particular, the growth rate of the infection has been fitted as an exponential decay, as compared to a linear decay, reported previously. The model has been validated with the data of China and South Korea, where the pandemic is nearing to its end. The data of Italy, Germany, Spain, and Sweden show that the peak of the infection has reached i.e. a time when the new infections will start to decrease as compared to the previous day. The model predicts the approximate number of total infections at the end of the outbreak. The model prediction of the USA, and Brazil show that the peak will reach in the next two three weeks. The total number of infections in the USA is estimated to be around 4 million by the model. The reported data of India show the start of disease evolution, with a large initial scatter in the growth rate. The possible peak date available.	0

In addition, it intuitively places humans as the drivers of the future evolution of animal species and strengthens the idea that humans do not actually belong to the animal kingdom, and all this for insufficient reasons, such as specific evolutionary history (i.e., granting us with an exceptional cognitive capacity).	1

1431	Using a Systems Biology approach, we integrated genomic, COVID 19 pandemic. The expression data analysis of the Renin Angiotensin System indicates mild nasal, oral or throat infections are likely and that the gastrointestinal tissues are a common primary target of SARS CoV 2. Extreme symptoms in the lower respiratory system likely result from a secondary infection possibly by a comorbidity driven upregulation of ACE2 in the lung. The remarkable differences in expression of other RAS elements, the elimination of macrophages and the activation of cytokines in COVID 19 bronchoalveolar samples suggest that a functional immune deficiency is a critical outcome of COVID 19. We posit that using a non respiratory system as a major pathway of infection is likely determining the unprecedented global spread of this coronavirus.	1

1433	"Public health officials need tools to assist with anticipating the healthcare resources required to confront the SARS COV 2 pandemic. We built a modeling tool to aid practicing public health officials with estimating healthcare demand from the pandemic in their jurisdictions and to evaluate the potential impacts of population wide social distancing interventions.
Methods. The tool uses a SEIR compartmental model to project the local spread of the pandemic. Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select intervention strategies to evaluate. Outputs include the number of infections and deaths with and without intervention, and the demand for hospital and critical care beds and ventilators relative to existing capacity. We illustrate the tool using data from three regions of Chile.
Our scenarios indicate a surge in COVID 19 patients could overwhelm Chilean hospitals by late May, peaking around mid June at 7 to 50 times the current supply of beds and ventilators. A lockdown strategy or combination of case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing of individuals greater than 70 years, and telework interventions may keep treatment demand below capacity.
Aggressive interventions can avert substantial morbidity and mortality from COVID 19. Our tool permits rapid evaluation of locally applicable policy scenarios and updating of results as new data become available."	0

We used Clauset Newman Moore (CNM) clustering algorithm to develop web network of confirmed cases to identified clusters of community transmission.
Results: Out of 1192 confirmed cases, 90.60% were symptomatic and 9.39% were asymptomatic. The prevalence of COVID19 in males was 56.29% and 43.20 % in females. The mean interval (±SD) from symptom onset to diagnosis was 6±22.6 days while mean interval (±SD) from contact to onset of symptoms was 5±19.5 days. People of age range 40 79 were more infected and deaths median age was 80. The main symptoms were fever, dry cough, fatigue and pneumonia. The main infected cities were Tokyo (195/1192, 16.35%), Hokkaido (160/1192 13.42%), Aichi (150/1192, 12.58%) and Osaka (145/1192, 12.16%).

Through alignment with SARS CoV and SL CoVs S proteins, we located the functional domains in SARS CoV 2 S protein, which contains S1 subunit and S2 subunit with the cleavage site at R685/S686.15 S1 subunit is located within the N terminal 14–685 amino acids of S protein, containing N terminal domain (NTD), receptor binding domain (RBD), and receptor binding motif (RBM). Actually, the plasma membrane fusion pathway is more efficient than the endosomal membrane fusion pathway for most viruses because the latter is more prone to activating the host cell antiviral immunity.23,24 Generally, β B coronaviruses lack the S1/S2 furin recognition site, and their S proteins are uncleaved in the native state. A recent report suggested that SARS CoV 2 mainly used TMPRSS2 for plasma membrane fusion; this means that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor might constitute an option for blocking SARS CoV 2 fusion with and entry into the host cell.27
The 6 HB structure formed by HR1 and HR2 regions in the S2 subunit of HCoVs plays a key role during the viral membrane fusion process, which makes it one of the most important targets for drug design.

1439	Pseudoviruses are useful virological tools because of their safety and versatility, especially for emerging and re emerging viruses. Due to its high pathogenicity and infectivity and the lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics, live SARS CoV 2 has 3 conditions, which has hindered the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Based on a VSV pseudovirus production system, a pseudovirus based neutralization assay has been developed for evaluating neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV 2 in biosafety level 2 facilities. The key parameters for this assay were optimized, including cell types, cell numbers, virus inoculum. When tested against the SARS CoV 2 pseudovirus, SARS CoV 2 convalescent patient sera showed high neutralizing potency, which underscore its potential as therapeutics. The limit of detection for this assay was determined as 22.1 and 43.2 for human and mouse serum samples respectively using a panel of 120 negative samples. The cutoff values were set as 30 and 50 for human and mouse serum samples, respectively. This assay showed relatively low coefficient of variations with 15.9% and 16.2% for the intra and inter assay analyses respectively. Taken together, we established a robust pseudovirus based neutralization assay for SARS CoV 2 and are glad to share pseudoviruses and related protocols with the developers of vaccines or therapeutics to fight against this lethal virus.	1

1443	As shown by the current COVID 19 pandemic, emergency departments (ED) are the front line for hospital and community based care during viral respiratory disease outbreaks. As such, EDs must be able to reorganize and reformat operations to meet the changing needs and staggering patient volume. This paper addresses ways to adapt departmental operations to better manage in times of elevated disease burden, specifically identifying areas of intervention to help limit crowding and spread. Using experience from past outbreaks and the current COVID 19 pandemic, we advise strategies to increase surge a designated unit to limit exposure early in an outbreak. Screening and PPE guidelines for both patient and staff should be followed closely, as determined by hospital administration and the CDC. Equipment needs are also greatly affected in an outbreak; we emphasis portable radiographic equipment to limit transport, and an upstocking of certain medications, respiratory supplies, and PPE.	1

The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID 19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data Methods: By estimating the three parameters of time dependent transmission rate, timedependent recovery rate, and time dependent mortality rate from Covid 19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid 19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. Findings: On average, 925 people with COVID 19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within one week (15.03.2020 to 03.21.2020) and reaches its highest point on 03.18.2020 with 1126 infected cases.
The most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact."	0
1446	A likely scenario for the origin of SARS‐CoV‐2 is that the bat and the pangolin β‐CoVs have infected one and the same organism (we do not know which one exactly), and their genes recombined, pangolin RBD into the S protein of the bat β‐CoV. The RBD from the pangolin virus has additional implications for the infectious nature of SARS‐CoV‐2. The importance of proteolytic cleavage at the furin cleavage site for the zoonotic transmission of viruses is in part based on experimental data with the MERS‐like CoV from bats, which cannot efficiently enter human cells, unless small amounts of trypsin protease are added to the virion to mimic the furin cleavage of the S protein [6].	1
1447	The novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 is the causative agent of the acute respiratory disease COVID 19 which has become a global concern due to its rapid spread. Meanwhile, increased demand in testing has led to shortage of reagents, supplies, and compromised the performance of diagnostic laboratories in many countries. Both the world health organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend multi step RT PCR assays using multiple primer and probe pairs, which might complicate interpretation of the test results especially for borderline cases. In this study, we describe an alternative RT PCR approach for the detection of SARS CoV 2 RNA that can be used for the probe based detection of clinical isolates in the diagnostics as well as in research labs using a low cost SYBR green method. For the evaluation, we used samples from patients with confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection and performed RT PCR assays along with successive dilutions of RNA standards to determine the limit of detection. We identified an M gene binding primer and probe pair highly suitable for purposes.	0

We collected data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and symptom onset day of the confirmed cases, which had been announced by the Chinese local authorities. We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first generation cases prior to symptom onset.
The estimated mean incubation period for COVID 19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1±3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at  1 and 13 days. The infectious curve showed that in 73.0% of the secondary cases, their date of getting infected was before symptom onset of the first generation cases, particularly in the last three days of the incubation period.
The results indicated the transmission of COVID 9 occurs among close contacts during the incubation period, which may lead to a quarantine loophole.

1453	The recent coronavirus pandemic follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion, with the number of cases as a function of time reasonably well fit by N (t) ∝ e αt , in many countries. We analyze the rate α in different countries, choosing as a starting point in each country a threshold of 30 total cases and fitting for the following 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth in a rather homogeneous way. We look for a link between the rate α and the average temperature T of each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. We analyze a base set of 42 countries, which developed the epidemic at an earlier stage, an intermediate set of 88 countries and an extended set of 125 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently. Fitting with a linear behavior α(T ), we find increasing evidence in the three datasets for a decreasing growth rate as a function of T , at 99.66%C.L., 99.86%C.L. and 99.99995% C.L. (p value 5 · 10 −7 , or 5σ detection) in the base, intermediate and extended dataset, respectively. The doubling time is expected to increase by 40% ∼ 50%, going from 5 • C to 25 • C. In the base set, going beyond a linear model, a peak at about (7.7 ± 3.6) • C seems to be present in the data, but such evidence disappears for the larger datasets. Moreover we have analyzed the possible existence of a bias: poor countries, typically located in warm regions, might have less intense testing. By excluding countries below a given GDP per capita from the dataset, we find that this affects our conclusions only slightly and only for the extended dataset. The significance always remains high, with a p value of about 10 −3 − 10 −4 or less. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation should be hopefully stopped by strong lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the next cold season.	0
1454	"The COVID 19 pandemic imposed a drastic reduction in surgical activity in order to respond to the influx of hospital patients and to protect uninfected patients by avoiding hospitalization. However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences. The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS 
Methods: This is a non interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery. The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS Cov 2 were collected from the computerized medical record.
: From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery services, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS Cov 2. There Page 4 of 17 J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 4
were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35 68 years). All patients had co morbidities. The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n = 5), complex emergencies (n = 5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n = 3), gastroplasty (n = 1), and stoma closure (n = 1). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS Cov 2 infection was 34 days (5 61 days). In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15 63 days). At the end of the follow up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post hospitalization.
The risk of SARS Cov 2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk. Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity."	0
1455	"The novel coronavirus SARS CoV2 has been observed to cause a higher incidence and greater severity of disease in males, as seen in multiple cohorts across the globe. The reasons for gender disparity in disease severity is unclear and can be due to host factors. To determine whether males have delayed viral clearance after infection, we evaluated the time to clearance in symptomatic patients tested by serial oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs followed by RT PCR at a reference lab in Mumbai, India. A total of 68 subjects with median age of 37 years (3 75 range) were examined and included 48 (71%) males and 20 (29%) females. We observed that females were able to achieve viral clearance significantly earlier than males, with a median difference of 2 days in achieving a negative PCR result (P value = 0.038). Furthermore, examination of 3 families with both male and female patients followed serially, demonstrated that female members of the same household cleared the SARS CoV2 infection earlier in each family. To determine reasons for delayed clearance in males, we examined the expression patterns of the SARS CoV2 receptor, Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in tissue specific repositories. We observed that the testes was one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression in 3 independent RNA expression databases (Human Protein Atlas, FAMTOM5 and GETx). ACE2 was also determined to be highly expressed in testicular cells at the protein levels. Interestingly, very little expression of ACE2 was seen in ovarian tissue. Taken together, these observations demonstrate for the first time that male subjects have delayed viral clearance of SARS CoV2. High expression of ACE2 in testes raises the possibility that testicular viral reservoirs may play a role in viral persistence in males and should be further investigated.

1456	"To assess the clinical severity of COVID 19 pneumonia using qualitative and/or quantitative chest CT indicators and identify the CT characteristics of critical cases.
Fifty one patients with COVID 19 pneumonia including ordinary cases (group A,n=12), severe cases(group B, n=15) and critical cases (group C,n=24) were retrospectively enrolled. The qualitative and quantitative indicators from chest CT were recorded and compared using Fisher's exact test, one way ANOVA, Kruskal Wallis H test and receiver operating characteristic analysis.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the number of involved lung segments and lobes, the frequencies of consolidation, crazy paving pattern and air bronchogram increased in more severe cases. Qualitative indicators including total severity score for the whole lung and total score for crazy paving and consolidation could distinguish groups B and C from A(69% sensitivity, 83% specificity and 73% accuracy) but were similar between group B and group C.
Combined qualitative and quantitative indicators could distinguish these three groups with high sensitivity(B C vs.A ,90%; C vs. B, 92%),specificity(100%, 87% ) and accuracy(92%, 90%).
Critical cases had higher total severity score(>10) and higher total score for crazy paving and consolidation(>4) than ordinary cases, and had higher mean lung density(> 779HU) and full width at half maximum(>128HU) but lower relative volume of normal lung density(≦50%) than ordinary/severe cases. In our critical cases, eight patients with relative volume of normal lung density smaller than 40% received mechanical ventilation for supportive treatment, and two of them had died.
A rapid, accurate severity assessment of COVID 19 pneumonia based on chest CT would be feasible and could provide help for making management decisions, especially for the critical cases.

The rapid and accurate assessment of clinical severity for COVID 19 pneumonia is crucial for early management, treatment, and disease monitoring. Especially for critical cases, early identifications are of paramount importance to reduce mortality. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the qualitative and/or quantitative indicators from chest CT could identify patients in different clinical stages and further identify the CT characteristics of critical cases."	0

Background:
SARS CoV 2 test kits are in critical shortage in many countries. This limits large scale population testing and hinders the effort to identify and isolate infected individuals.
Objectives:
Herein, we developed and evaluated multi stage group testing schemes that test samples in groups of various pool sizes in multiple stages. Through this approach, groups of negative samples can be eliminated with a single test, avoiding the need for individual testing and achieving considerable savings of resources.
We designed and parameterized various multi stage testing schemes and compared their efficiency at different prevalence rates using computer simulations.
We found that three stage testing schemes with pool sizes of maximum 16 samples can test up to three and seven times as many individuals with the same number of test kits for prevalence rates of around 5% and 1%, respectively. We propose an adaptive approach, where the optimal testing scheme is selected based on the expected prevalence rate.
These group testing schemes could lead to a major reduction in the number of testing kits required and help improve large scale population testing in general and in the context of the current COVID 19 pandemic.

1461	The new type of pneumonia caused by the SARS CoV 2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been declared as a global public health concern by WHO. As of April 3, 2020, more than 1,000,000 human infections have been diagnosed around the world, which exhibited apparent person to person transmission characteristics of this virus. The capacity of vertical transmission in SARS CoV 2 remains controversial recently. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is now confirmed as the receptor of SARS CoV 2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. In present study, we collected the online available single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ACE2 in maternal fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs. Our results revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternal fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta. Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney. And in a study containing series fetal and post natal mouse lung, we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post natal day 1~3. In summary, this study revealed that the SARS CoV 2 receptor was widely spread in specific cell types of maternal fetal interface and fetal organs. And thus, both the vertical transmission and the placenta dysfunction/abortion caused by practice.	0
1462	"Viruses need to hijack the translational machinery of the host cell for a productive infection to happen. However, given the dynamic landscape of tRNA pools among tissues, it is unclear whether different viruses infecting different tissues have adapted their codon usage toward their tropism. Here, we collect the coding sequences of over 500 human infecting viruses and determine that tropism explains changes in codon usage. Using an in silico model of translational efficiency, we validate the correspondence of the viral codon usage with the translational machinery of their tropism. In particular, we propose that the improved translational adaptation to the upper respiratory airways of the pandemic agent SARS CoV 2 coronavirus could enhance its transmissibility. Furthermore, this correspondence is specifically defined in early viral proteins, as upon infection cells undergo reprogramming of tRNA pools that favors the translation of late counterparts.

1465	"Bats are recognized as important reservoirs of viruses deadly to other mammals, including humans. These infections are typically nonpathogenic in bats raising questions about innate immune differences that might exist between bats and other mammals. Tetherin is an important restriction factor which inhibits the release of a diverse range of viruses from host cells, including retroviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses, and paramyxoviruses, some of which are deadly to humans and transmitted by bats. Here we characterise the tetherin genes from 27 species of bats, revealing that they are under strong selective pressure, and that fruit bats and vesper bats express unique structural variants of the tetherin protein. The expression of two computationally predicted splice isoforms of fruit bat tetherin is verified here, and we identify an additional third unique splice isoform which includes a C terminal region that is not homologous to known mammalian tetherin variants. We also report that vesper bats possess and express at least five tetherin genes, including structural variants, a greater number than any other mammal reported to date.
These findings support the mammals."	0

1473	"Large scale disease screening is a complicated process in which high costs must be balanced against pressing public health needs. When the goal is screening for infectious disease, one approach is group testing in which samples are initially tested in pools and individual samples are retested only if the initial pooled test was positive.
Intuitively, if the prevalence of infection is small, this could result in a large reduction of the total number of tests required. Despite this, the use of group testing in medical studies has been limited, largely due to skepticism about the impact of pooling on the accuracy of a given assay. While there is a large body of research addressing the issue of testing errors in group testing studies, it is customary to assume that the misclassification parameters are known from an external population and/or that the values do not change with the group size. Both of these assumptions are highly questionable for many medical practitioners considering group testing in their study design.
In this article, we explore how the failure of these assumptions might impact the efficacy of a group testing design and, consequently, whether group testing is currently feasible for medical screening. Specifically, we look at how incorrect assumptions about the sensitivity function at the design stage can lead to poor estimation of a procedureâĂŹs overall sensitivity and expected number of tests. Furthermore, if a validation study is used to estimate the pooled misclassification parameters of a given assay, we show that the sample sizes required are so large as to be prohibitive in all but the largest screening programs.
KEYWORDS:
Developing design strategies to reduce study expense is an important job for the practicing biostatistician. In many settings, measuring biomarkers can be expensive, and design strategies for reducing these costs are needed. In 1943, Dorfman 1 proposed a simple method to make the testing of syphilis feasible in recruits for the U.S. Army. This simple design suggested testing a arXiv:2004.04837v1 [stat.AP] 9 Apr 2020 2 pooled collection of k samples, and only testing individual samples if the combined sample is positive. Intuitively, this design could provide a tremendous cost reduction in terms of the required number of tests if the disease prevalence is small.
There has been a vast amount of research in group testing since the original Dorfman paper. A majority of this work can be divided into either using group testing for disease screening or for prevalence estimation. Particularly for the application of group testing to screening, there has been lots of work not only in the statistics literature, but also in computer science and applied mathematics.(see, 2,3,4,5,6 among others) This is because optimality of group testing algorithms often involves choosing a particular set of group sizes that minimizes the expected number of tests required to identify all cases in a population of individuals.
Deriving optimal designs often involve the development of complex algorithms that rely on dynamic programming, mathematical techniques that are usually applied in areas of applied mathematics and computer science, and less often in statistics. There has also been extensive work in prevalence estimation, where participants are tested in pools with no re testing at the individual level. This article will focus on the use of group testing in disease screening.
Although methodological research in this area has expanded, we believe that there has been limited use of these designs as they were originally formulated in the biomedical sciences for disease screening. The syphilis example in World War II is a notable example. We have seen a reluctance by our epidemiologic collaborators to use these designs in large scale studies. In part this is due to our laboratory and epidemiology colleagues not being aware of the advantages of the group testing methodology.
However, most often, scientists are afraid that the combining of tests across samples on different participants decreases the sensitivity of the test, thereby increasing the likelihood of a false negative on a grouped test. Furthermore, it is perceived that in much of the group testing literature unreasonable assumptions have been made that, in many cases, favor the use of group testing procedures over single testing. The goal of this current article is to provide a balanced view of the research in this area and to provide suggestions for evaluating its feasibility in practical settings.
There are a number of issues that have caused confusion and have made comparisons with individual testing difficult. These include:
i. Questions over how to choose a design that appropriately accounts for misclassification.
ii. Assumptions of non differential misclassification, or that the testing errors do not change with the group size.
iii. Assumptions that sensitivity and specificity values are known a priori from external sources and can be readily applied to the question at hand.
A careful comparison of group testing with individual testing that takes into account these issues is important in deciding the situations where group testing should be used for disease identification in the biosciences. In what follows, we introduce several case studies that are representative of the types of problems in which group testing is appealing to researchers, but current limitations raise questions about or prevent its use. This is followed by a full discussion of each of the above issues. We then 3 present numerical comparisons to examine the impact of incorrect assumptions regarding the misclassification parameters on a screening procedure and the feasibility of using a validation study to estimate these values.
CASE STUDIES
Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) was first identified in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and is rapidly spreading worldwide with dramatic impacts on the healthcare and economic landscapes. In the United States, shortages of testing reageants hinder the ability to carry out sufficient screening for infection with SARS CoV 2 which may ultimately threaten the ability of public health officials to adequately control the spread of the virus. The need for large scale screening, coupled with scarce testing resources, make this an ideal scenario for implementing group testing to reduce the number of tests required to carry out a screening program.
Monitoring of viral load in individuals diagnosed with HIV is important for determining treatment failure and making informed treatment decisions. Current World Health Organization guidelines recommend viral load testing at 6 and 12 months following initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and annually thereafter. 7 These recommendations have proven to be cost prohibitive, and continue to be impractical in many low resource settings. For example, in Malawi, a country with over 1 million people living with HIV and over 600,000 taking ART, 8 the annual burden of sufficient viral load monitoring is enormous. In this context, group testing has regularly been considered as a cost saving measure, however concerns over false negative rates are common. 9,10,11
Cervical cancer is currently the 4th most common cancer among women, 12 highlighting the need for cheap and effective clinical screening. The most effective indicator of cervical cancer risk is HPV infection, however only a small number of HPV positive women will go on to develop cervical cancer. To minimize unnecessary and invasive follow up procedures such as colposcopy, it is necessary to develop better tests for triaging HPV infections in order to identify those at greater risk of progressing to cancer.
One promising method is methylation testing which captures the methylation of HPV DNA transitioning to precancer. 13, 12, 14 Unfortunately, such tests are too expensive to routinely carry out for all HPV positive women. Group testing could offer one way of making such testing feasible."	0

1475	"Background: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions. Although generally safe and well tolerated they are potentially lethal in overdose. These two drugs are now candidates for the prevention and treatment of COVID19. In vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses will be needed if they are to be of benefit, but as yet there is no convincing evidence they are clinically effective. Nevertheless they are already being used very widely and fatal accidental overdoses have been reported.
Methods: Individual data from prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses and were managed in the national toxicology intensive care unit in Paris were pooled. Bayesian logistic regression was used to estimate a concentration fatality curve. The probabilities of fatal iatrogenic toxicity with the chloroquine regimens currently being trialled for the treatment of COVID19 were estimated from a combined pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic model.
Findings: In total, 258 patients were studied of whom 26 died (10%). There was a steep sigmoid relationship between admission whole blood chloroquine concentrations and death. Concentrations above 13µmol/L (95% credible interval (C.I.), 10 to 16) were associated with greater than 1% mortality. Based on peak concentrations, absolute fatality ratios in the high dose arm (chloroquine base equivalent adult dose of 600mg given twice daily for ten days) of a recently terminated trial were estimated between 0.06% (90kg adult, 95%C.I. 0 to 0.3%) and 4.8% (40kg adult, 95% C.I. 1.9 to 9.7%). This regimen results in peak concentrations above 10µmol/L in more than 60% of adults weighing 70kg. The other high dose regimens trialled currently for COVID19 result in peak concentrations above 10µmol/L in only 0.2% of adults weighting 70kg.
Interpretation: High dose chloroquine treatment regimens which result in whole blood chloroquine concentrations below 10µmol/L for the majority of patients should not result in life threatening cardiovascular toxicity.
We searched Pubmed using the terms (chloroquine OR hydroxychloroquine) AND (suicide OR intoxication OR poisoning) AND concentration NOT mice, which returned 90 results. After excluding reviews, case reports with concentrations measured post mortem, healthy volunteer studies, animal studies and laboratory studies, 16 publications were retained. Of these, 12 were case reports and 4 were hospital cohorts. Case reports exhibited significant bias towards individuals with high concentrations who survived. Of the 4 hospital cohorts, we extracted data manually from one, and obtained the original data for two.
Added value of this study We provide an objective methodology to evaluate the risk of overdose for chloroquine treatment or prevention regimens currently being trialled in COVID19. This can be used to assess formally the risk benefit trade off when administering large doses for treatment .
Implications of all the available evidence Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID19 must balance the significant toxicity of high dose treatment regimens against their expected therapeutic benefit. The majority of treatment regimens and all preventive regimens under investigation have satisfactory safety margins."	0

Patients infected with SARS CoV 2 show a wide range of symptoms and disease severity, while limited data is available on its immunogenicity.
Here, the kinetics of the development of SARS CoV 2 specific antibody responses in relation to clinical features and dynamics of specific B cell populations are reported.
Immunophenotyping of B cells was performed by flow cytometry with longitudinally collected PBMCs. In parallel, serum samples were analyzed for the presence of SARS CoV 2 specific IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies using whole proteome peptide microarrays. Soon after disease onset in a mild case, we observed an increased frequency of plasmablasts concomitantly with a strong SARS CoV 2 specific IgA response. In contrast, a case with more severe progression showed a delayed, but eventually very strong and broad SARS CoV 2 specific IgA response.
This case study shows that determining SARS CoV 2 specific antibody epitopes can be valuable to monitor the specificity and magnitude of the early B cell response, which could guide the development of vaccine candidates.

We use the quantitative landscape of the disease spreading daily infections per country and, perhaps more importantly, the duration of the epidemic in each country. Our quantitative approach is based on a Gaussian spreading hypothesis that is shown to arise as a result of imposed measures in a simple dynamical infection model. This may have consequences and shed light in the efficiency of policies once the phenomenon is over.	1

Abstract J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f Purpose: To analyse the high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) early imaging features and the changing trend of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pneumonia. Materials and Methods: Forty six patients with COVID 19 pneumonia who had an isolated lesion on the first positive CT were enrolled in this study. The following parameters were recorded for each lesion: sites, sizes, location (peripheral or central), attenuation (ground glass opacity or consolidation), and other abnormalities (supply pulmonary artery dilation, air bronchogram, interstitial thickening, etc.). The follow up CT images were compared with the previous CT scans, and the development of the lesions was evaluated. Results: The lesions tended to be peripheral and subpleural. All the lesions exhibited ground glass opacity with or without consolidation. A higher proportion of supply pulmonary artery dilation (89.13% [41/46]) and air bronchogram (69.57% [32/46]) were found. Other findings included thickening of the intralobular interstitium and a halo sign of ground glass around a solid nodule. Cavitation, calcification or lymphadelopathy were not observed. The reticular patterns were noted from the 14 days after symptoms onset in 7 of 20 patients (45%). At 22 31 days, the lesions were completely absorbed only in 2 of 7 patients(28.57%).
The typical early CT features of COVID 19 pneumonia are ground glass opacity, and located peripheral or subpleural location, and with supply J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f pulmonary artery dilation. Reticulation was evident after the 2nd week and persisted in half of patients evaluated in 4 weeks after the onset.

1490	As a consequence of missing data on tests for infection and imperfect accuracy of tests, reported rates of population infection by the SARS CoV 2 virus are lower than actual rates of infection. Hence, reported rates of severe illness conditional on infection are higher than actual rates. Understanding the time path of the COVID 19 pandemic has been hampered by the absence of bounds on infection rates that are credible and informative. This paper explains the logical problem of bounding these rates and reports illustrative findings, using data from Illinois, New York, and Italy. We combine the data with assumptions on the infection rate in the untested population and on the accuracy of the tests that appear	1

1492	A cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) was reported by China in late December 2019. Reported case incidence has now reached the hundreds, but this is likely an underestimate. As of 24 January 2020, with reports of thirteen exportation events, we estimate the cumulative incidence in China at 5502 cases (95% confidence in the order of thousands, rather than hundreds, and there is a strong indication that untraced exposures other than the one in the epidemiologically linked seafood market in Wuhan have occurred.	1

1494	"Objectives: To estimate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of COVID 19 in the early stage of the epidemic and predict the expected number of new cases in Shahroud, Northeast of Iran.
The R 0 of COVID 19 was estimated using the serial interval distribution and the number of incidence cases. The serial interval was fit with a gamma distribution. The probable incidence and cumulative incidence in the next 30 days were predicted using the assumption that daily incidence follows a Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Data analysis was done using ""earlyR"" and ""projections"" packages in R software.
The maximum likelihood value of R 0 was 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1 to 3.4) for the COVID 19 epidemic in the early 14 days and decreased to 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.25) by the end of the day 41. The expected average number of new cases in Shahroud is 9.0±3.8 case/day, which means an estimated total of 271 (95% CI: 178 383) new cases in the next 30 days.
It is essential to reduce the R 0 to values below one. Therefore, we strongly recommend enforcing and continuing the current preventive measures, restricting population."	0
1495	The earliest cases were identified through the “pneumonia of unknown etiology” surveillance mechanism.4 Pneumonia of unknown etiology is defined as an illness without a causative pathogen identified that fulfills the following criteria: fever (≥38°C), radiographic evidence of pneumonia, low or normal white cell count or low lymphocyte count, and no symptomatic improvement after antimicrobial treatment for 3 to 5 days following standard clinical guidelines. Investigators interviewed each patient with infection and their relatives, where necessary, to determine exposure histories during the 2 weeks before the illness onset, including the dates, times, frequency, and patterns of exposures to any wild animals, especially those purportedly available in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, or exposures to any relevant environments such as that specific market or other wet markets. Although infections in health care workers have been detected, the proportion has not been as high as during the SARS and MERS outbreaks.15 One of the features of SARS and MERS outbreaks is heterogeneity in transmissibility, and in particular the occurrence of super spreading events, particularly in hospitals.16 Super spreading events have not yet been identified for NCIP, but they could become a feature as the epidemic progresses.	0
1496	"The first reported UK case of COVID 19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R 0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase.
UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R 0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown.
In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R 0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April."	0
1497	"In a move described as unprecedented in public health history, starting 24 January 2020, China imposed quarantine and isolation restrictions in Wuhan, a city of more than 10 million people. This raised the question: is mass quarantine and isolation effective as a social tool in addition to its scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address this question, using a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine learning, we show that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan brought down the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID 19 spread from R(t) > 1 to R(t) < 1 within a month after the imposition of quarantine control measures in Wuhan, China. This ultimately resulted in a stagnation phase in the infected case count in Wuhan. Our results indicate that the strict public health policies implemented in Wuhan may have played a crucial role in halting down the spread of infection and such measures should potentially be implemented in other highly affected countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran to curtail spread of the disease. Finally, our forecasting results predict a stagnation in the quarantine control measures implemented in Wuhan towards the end of March 2020; this would lead to a subsequent stagnation in the effective reproduction number at R(t) < 1. We warn that immediate relaxation of the quarantine measures in Wuhan may lead to a relapse in the infection spread and a subsequent increase in the effective reproduction number to R(t) > 1. Thus, it may be wise to relax quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which maximum of the quarantined/isolated individuals are recovered.
(*It should be noted when we mention quarantine subsequently in the paper, we mean the infected people who are quarantined and isolated and cannot lead to an infection in a susceptible person.)"	0

Here we present findings from a proactive longitudinal sampling study of acute viral respiratory infections that documents rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care seeking for seasonal coronavirus. We find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms. These numbers indicate that a very high percentage of seasonal coronavirus infections are undocumented and provide a reference for understanding the spread of the emergent nCoV.

1506	This data consists of 245 clinically recovered patients. The first part of the paper studies the descriptive statistics and the influence of demographic parameters, namely age and gender, in the clinical recovery period of COVID 19 patients. The second part of the paper is on identifying the distribution of the length of the recovery period for the patients. We identify a piecewise analysis of three different periods, identified based on trends of both positive confirmation and clinical recovery of COVID 19. As expected, the overall recovery rate has reduced drastically during the exponential increase of incidences. However, our in depth analysis shows that there is a shift in the age group of incidences to the younger population, and the recovery period of the younger population is considerably lower. Here, we have estimated the recovery rate to be 0.125. Overall, the prognosis of COVID 19 indicates an improvement in recovery rate owing to the government mandated practices of restricted mobility of the older population and aggressive contact tracing.	0
1507	"The ability to detect an infectious agent in a widespread epidemic is crucial to the success of quarantine efforts in addition to sensitive and accurate screening of potential cases of infection from patients in a clinical setting. Enabling testing outside of sophisticated laboratories broadens the scope of control and surveillance efforts, but also requires robust and simple methods that can be used without expensive instrumentation. Here we report a method to identify SARS CoV 2 (COVID 19) virus RNA from purified RNA or cell lysis using loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using a visual, colorimetric detection. This test was additionally verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID 19 patients in Wuhan, China with equivalent performance to a commercial RT qPCR test while requiring only heating and visual inspection. This simple and sensitive method provides an opportunity to facilitate virus detection in the field without a requirement for complex diagnostic infrastructure.

1508	"A s we enter the second quarter of the COVID 19 pandemic, with testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) increasingly available (though still limited and/or slow in some areas), we are faced with new questions and challenges regarding this novel virus. When to test? Whom to test? What to test? How often to test? And, what to do with test results? Since SARS CoV 2 is a new virus, there is little evidence to fall back on for test utilization and diagnostic stewardship (1). Several points need to be considered to begin answering of these questions; specifically, what types of tests are available and under which circumstances are they useful? This understanding can help guide the use of testing at the local, regional, state, and national levels and inform those assessing the supply chain to ensure that needed testing is and continues to be available. Here, we explain the types of tests available and how they might be useful in the face of a rapidly changing and never beforeexperienced situation. There are two broad categories of SARS CoV 2 tests: those that detect the virus itself and those that detect the host's response to the virus. Each will be considered separately.
We must recognize that we are dealing with (i) a new virus, (ii) an unprecedented pandemic in modern times, and (iii) uncharted territory. With this in mind, in the absence of either proven effective therapy or a vaccine, diagnostic testing, which we have, becomes an especially important tool, informing patient management and potentially helping to save lives by limiting the spread of SARS CoV 2. What is the most appropriate test, and for whom and when?
Hypothetically, if the entire world's population could be tested all at once, with a test providing 100% specificity and sensitivity (unrealistic, obviously), we might be able to identify all infected individuals and sort people into those who at that moment in time were asymptomatic, minimally/moderately symptomatic, and severely symptomatic. The asymptomatic and minimally/moderately symptomatic could be quarantined to avoid the spread of the virus, with the severely symptomatic managed and isolated in health care settings. Contract tracing could be carried out to find those at risk of being in the incubation period by virtue of their exposure. Alternatively, testing for a host response, if, again, the test were hypothetically 100% sensitive and specific, could identify those previously exposed to the virus and (if we knew this to be true, which we do not) label those who are immune to the virus, who could be tapped to work in"	0

1514	With the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the number of individuals that need to be tested for COVID 19 has been rapidly increasing. A walk through (WT) screening center using negative pressure booths that is inspired by the biosafety cabinet has been designed and implemented in Korea for easy screening of COVID 19 and for safe and efficient consultation for patients with fever or respiratory symptoms. Here, we present the overall concept, advantages, and limitations of the COVID 19 WT screening center. The WT center increases patient access to the screening clinics and adequately protects healthcare personnel while reducing the consumption of personal protective equipment. It can also increase the number of people tested by 9 10 fold. However, there is a risk of crossinfection at each stage of screening treatment, including the booths, and adverse reactions with disinfection of the booths. These limitations can be overcome using mobile technology and increasing the number of booths to reduce congestion inside the center, reducing booth volume for sufficient and rapid ventilation, and using an effective, harmless, and certified environmental disinfectant. A WT center can be implemented in other institutions and countries and modified depending on local needs to cope with the COVID 19 pandemic.	0
1515	The N acyl amino acids are a family of bioactive lipids with pleiotropic physiologic functions, including in energy homeostasis. Their endogenous levels are regulated by an extracellular mammalian N acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase called PM20D1 (peptidase M20 domain containing 1). Using an activity guided biochemical approach, we report the molecular identification of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) as a second intracellular N acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase. In vitro, FAAH exhibits a more restricted substrate scope compared to PM20D1. In mice, genetic ablation or selective pharmacological inhibition of FAAH bidirectionally dysregulates intracellular, but not circulating, N acyl amino acids. Dual blockade of both PM20D1 and FAAH reveals a dramatic and non additive biochemical engagement of these two enzymatic pathways. These data establish FAAH as a second intracellular pathway for N acyl amino acid metabolism and underscore enzymatic division of labor as an enabling strategy for the 2020;9:e55211.	0

1518	"Background: COVID 19, the latest outbreak of infectious disease, has caused huge medical challenges to China and the entire globe. No unified diagnostic standard has been formulated. The initial diagnosis remains based on the positive of nucleic acid tests. However, early nucleic acid tests were identified to be negative in some patients, whereas the patients exhibited characteristic CT changes of lung, and positive test results appeared after repeated nucleic acid tests, having caused the failure to diagnose these patients early. The study aimed to delve into the relationships between initial nucleic acid testing and early lung CT changes in patients with COVID 19. Method: In accordance with the latest COVID 19 diagnostic criteria, 69 patients diagnosed with COVID 19 treated in the infected V ward of Xiaogan Central Hospital from 2020/1/25 to 2020/2/6 were retrospectively analyzed. The consistency between the first COVID 19 nucleic acid test positive and lung CT changes was studied. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of CT and initial nucleic acid were studied. Result: The Kappa coefficient of initial nucleic acid positive changes and lung CT changes was −1.52. With a positive nucleic acid test as the gold standard, the sensitivity of lung CT was 12.00 %, 95 % CI: 4.6 24.3; with the changes of CT as the gold standard, the sensitivity of nucleic acid positive was 30.16 %, 95 % CI: 19.2−43.0. Conclusion: The consistency between the initial positive nucleic acid test and the CT changes in the lungs is poor; low sensitivity was achieved for initial nucleic acid detection and CT changes.

1519	"The Chinese government began implementing extensive public health measures aimed at confronting COVID 19 during January 2020. These measures included contact tracing, disease surveillance, and enforced social distancing, as well as close monitoring of those infected and extensive quarantine and isolation measures. Authorities engaged in an unprecedented effort to cordon off Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
The measures adopted in China echoed and amplified approaches undertaken during recent outbreaks of SARS (2003) and MERS (2012). Although their intensity is unique, these measures are largely grounded in long standing public health approaches to respiratory viruses. As COVID 19 has spread to other parts of the globe, other nations have adopted social distancing, quarantine, and isolation strategies. Here, we investigate how these measures have impacted COVID 19's time varying reproduction number at the national level and globally.

Because mitigation (t ) w i − t j strategies (or the lack thereof) may influence the time distribution between primary and secondary infections, we estimate the Weibull parameters jointly with the model instead of specifying the parameters using reported incubation times. The baseline rate captures the rate of exogenous μ (imported) infections in a given region. The point process in Equation (1) can be viewed as an approximation to the common SIR model of infectious diseases during the initial phase of an epidemic when the total infections is small compared to the overall population size [3].

Implementing response measures earlier in the disease epidemic reduces the disease transmission measured by R t at a faster speed. Thus, for regions at early stage of disease epidemic (e.g., South America), mitigation measures should be introduced early. Nation wide lockdown may not further reduce the speed of R t reduction compared to regional quarantine measures. In countries where disease transmission has slowed down, lifting of quarantine measures may lead to a persistent infection rate delaying full control of epidemic and thus should be implemented with caution."	0

We assume that this newer strain does not exhibit cross immunity with the original strain, hence those who are vaccinated and recovered from the original strain become susceptible to the newer strain. Recent events involving the COVID 19 virus demonstrates that it is possible for a viral strain to emerge from a population at a time when the influenza virus, a well known virus with a vaccine readily available for some of its strains, is active in a population.

Two other human coronaviruses are SARS CoV and MERS CoV, which lead to severe lung infections known as severe acute respiratory syndrome – SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome – MERS, respectively [1,2]. This is partly because the respiratory tract with an extensive mucosal surface area, and its exposure to the environment has everything favorable for microbial colonization and surveillance; and partly because of the nature of virus, that is pathogenic more than bacteria, and its power of attachment to the mucosal surface and to interact with it; so that the respiratory epithelium will be liable to superinfection, and this is what occurred with the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918–1919 [10].	0

Facing this critical situation, health care workers on the front line who are directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID 19 are at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. We focused on symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress for all participants, using Chinese versions of validated measurement tools.10,11,12,13 Accordingly, the 9 item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9; range, 0 27),10 the 7 item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD 7) scale (range, 0 21),11 the 7 item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; range, 0 28),12 and the 22 item Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES R; range, 0 88)13 were used to assess the severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, respectively.

1539	Computational models for the simulation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) epidemic evolution would be extremely useful to support authorities in designing healthcare policies and lockdown measures to contain its impact on public health and economy. In Italy, the devised forecasts have been mostly based on a pure data driven approach, by fitting and extrapolating open data on the epidemic evolution collected by the Italian Civil Protection Center. In this respect, SIR epidemiological models, which start from the description of the nonlinear interactions between population compartments, would be a much more desirable approach to understand and predict the collective emergent response. The present contribution addresses the fundamental question whether a SIR epidemiological model, suitably enriched with asymptomatic and dead individual compartments, could be able to provide reliable predictions on the epidemic evolution. To this aim, a machine learning approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to automatically identify the model parameters based on a training set of data of progressive increasing size, considering Lombardy in Italy as a case study. The analysis of the scatter in the forecasts shows that model predictions are quite sensitive to the size of the dataset used for training, and that further data are still required to achieve convergentand therefore reliable predictions. ____________________________________________________________________________	0

1541	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) shows a wide variation in expression and severity of symptoms, from very mild or no symptomes, to flu like symptoms, and in more severe cases, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Large differences in outcome have also been observed between males and females. The causes for this variability are likely to be multifactorial, and to include genetics. The SARS CoV 2 virus responsible for the infection uses the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell invasion, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Genetic variation in these two genes may thus modulate an individual's genetic predisposition to infection and virus clearance. While genetic data on COVID 19 patients is being gathered, we carried out a phenome wide association scan (PheWAS) to investigate the role of these genes in other human phenotypes in the general population. We examined 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokines and cardio metabolic biomarkers, as well as 58 medications in 36,339 volunteers from the Lifelines population biobank, in relation to 1,273 genetic variants located in or near ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While none reached our threshold for significance, we observed a suggestive association of polymorphisms within the ACE2 gene with (1) the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) combination therapies (p=5.7x10  4 ), an association that is significantly stronger in females (p diff =0.01), and (2) with the use of non steroid antiinflammatory and antirheumatic products (p=5.5x10  4 ). While these associations need to be confirmed in larger sample sizes, they suggest that these variants play a role in diseases such as hypertension and chronic inflammation that are often observed in the more severe COVID 19 cases.	0
1542	The recent pandemic created due to Novel Coronavirus (nCOV 2019) from Wuhan, China demanding a large scale of a general health emergency. This demands novel research on the vaccine to fight against this pandemic situation, re purposing of the existing drugs, phylogenetic analysis to identify the origin viruses, etc. The very preliminary task from the research community is to analyze the wide verities of existing related research articles, which is very much time consuming in such situations where each minute counts for saving hundreds of human lives. The entire manual processing is even lower down the efficiency in mining the information. We have developed a complete automatic literature mining system that delivers efficient and fast mining from existing biomedical literature databases. With the help of modern day deep learning algorithms, our system also delivers a summarization of important research articles that provides ease and fast comprehension of critical research articles. The system is currently scanning nearly 1,46,115,136 English words from 29,315 research articles in not greater than 1.5 seconds with multiple search keywords. Our research article presents the criticality of literature mining, especially in pandemic situations with the implementation and online deployment of the system.	1
1543	"We prepared the three dimensional model of the SARS CoV 2 (aka 2019 nCoV) 3C like protease (3CL ) using the crystal structure of the highly similar (96% identity) ortholog from the SARS CoV. All residues involved in the catalysis, substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved. Comparison of the polyprotein PP1AB sequences showed 86% identity. The 3C like cleavage sites on the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved. Based on the near identical substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS CoV enzyme can be conferred on its SARS CoV 2 counterpart. With the 3CL molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and proposed 16 candidates for consideration. Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache. The drugs Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) could be very effective owing to their dual inhibitory actions on two viral enzymes. How to cite this article:

1545	"Background. We investigated a likely scenario of COVID 19 spreading in Brazil through the complex airport network of the country, for the 90 days after the first national occurrence of the disease. After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following first occurrence of the virus coming from abroad. Methodology. We developed a SIR (Susceptible Infected Recovered) model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region. Results. The expansion of the SARS CoV 2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the airport closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all cities. The more an airport showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS CoV 2.
We discussed the weak pandemic control performance of Brazil in comparison with other tropical, developing countries, namely India and Nigeria. Finally, we proposed measures for containing virus spreading taking into consideration the scenario of high poverty. All rights reserved.

1547	The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already occur. Aim: We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available. Methods: Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019 nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019 nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology. Results: The workflow reliably detects 2019 nCoV, and further discriminates 2019 nCoV from SARS CoV. Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses. Control material is made available through European Virus Archive  Global (EVAg), a European Union infrastructure project. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates the enormous response capacity achieved through networks.	0

In coronaviruses, the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the distal part of S1 subunit of SARS CoV 2 spike protein can directly bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). RBD promote viral entry into the host cells and is an important therapeutic target. In this study, we discovered that theaflavin showed the lower idock score (idock score: −7.95 kcal/mol). To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin showed FullFitness score of  991.21 kcal/mol and estimated ΔG of  8.53 kcal/mol for the most favorable interaction with contact area of SARS CoV 2 RBD by SwissDock service. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were formed between theaflavin and Arg454, Phe456, Asn460, Cys480, Gln493, Asn501 and Val503 of SARS CoV 2 RBD, near the direct contact area with ACE2. Our results suggest that theaflavin could be the candidate of SARS CoV 2 entry inhibitor for further study.	0

This article focuses on how Korean health officials implemented drive through and walk through diagnostic testing, and extensive movement and contact tracing, to identify and inform exposed members of the public. Mobile applications from both government agencies and private developers played an important role in guiding people to testing centers, communicating movement trajectories of confirmed cases on digital maps, and tracking the health and movements of travelers and others at risk of exposure. This case study illustrates the importance of rapid adaptation of transportation infrastructure and location based information technology to respond to public health crises, and how governments can learn from experimentation and past experience to accelerate these responses.	1

Clinical grade recombinant human ACE2 can reduce SARS CoV 2 infection in cells and in multiple human organoid models.
We have previously provided the first genetic evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the critical receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), and ACE2 protects the lung from injury, providing a molecular explanation for the severe lung failure and death due to SARS CoV infections. ACE2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for SARS CoV 2 infections, and it has been proposed that inhibiting this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID 19. However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS CoV 2. Here, we show that clinical grade hrsACE2 reduced SARS CoV 2 recovery from Vero cells by a factor of 1,000 5,000. An equivalent mouse rsACE2 had no effect. We also show that SARS CoV 2 can directly infect engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids, which can be inhibited by hrsACE2. These data demonstrate that hrsACE2 can significantly block early stages of SARS CoV 2 infections."	0

Abstract SARS CoV 2 has caused tens of thousands of infections and more than one thousand deaths. There are currently no registered therapies for treating coronavirus infections. Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS CoV 2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3 chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly used anti viral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for SARS CoV 2 was constructed. Possible targets of these compounds and potential drugs acting on a certain target were predicted. This study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS CoV 2, new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies, and also possible new strategies for drug repositioning to treat SARS CoV 2 infections."	0

Background. We aimed to report the clinical characteristics of imported coronavirus disease 19 in Jiangsu Province.
We retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID 19 with WHO interim guidance in three Grade ⅢA hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020. Real time RT PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples.
Of the 80 patients infected with COVID 19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third time nucleic acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases ( 63.75%) respectively.
Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients ( 68.75%) showed abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patient died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days.

1557	In December 2019 and January 2020, novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV)  infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, and has already posed a serious threat to public health. ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019 nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019 nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity. In addition, due to the potential pathogenicity of the virus to testicular tissues, clinicians should pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical fertility.	0
1558	For the first time in history, on March 17,2020, the European Union closed all its external borders to contain the spreading of the coronavirus 2019, COVID 19. Throughout two past months, governments around the world have implemented massive travel restrictions and border control to mitigate the outbreak of this global pandemic. However, the precise effects of travel restrictions on the outbreak dynamics of COVID 19 remain unknown. Here we combine a global network mobility model with a local epidemiology model to simulate and predict the outbreak dynamics and outbreak control of COVID 19 across Europe. We correlate our mobility model to passenger air travel statistics and calibrate our epidemiology model using the number of reported COVID 19 cases for each country. Our simulations show that mobility networks of air travel can predict the emerging global diffusion pattern of a pandemic at the early stages of the outbreak. Our results suggest that an unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID 19, especially in Central Europe, Spain, and France. Ultimately, our network epidemiology model can inform political decision making and help identify exit strategies from current travel restrictions and total lockdown.	0
1559	"It usually takes me two or three days to prepare an impromptu speech.""  Mark Twain
Once again we are put to the test. With the emergence of the 2019 novel human coronavirus (2019 nCoV), healthcare systems worldwide are scrambling to meet the demands of a growing outbreak. Much akin to the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV), the ultimate scope and reach of the outbreak is fluid and presently unknown. Unlike Ebola virus disease, with its high infectivity and high mortality, no uniform demand exists for assessment and treatment of 2019 nCoV infected patients in designated unique pathogen unit (UPU) settings. Regardless, the evolving understanding of transmission dynamics and the increasing international case load, coupled with growing fear and misinformation, results in formidable pressure on healthcare systems to maximize patient triage, staffing, confirmatory testing, communication, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and patient placement. In the face of immense challenges, maximum and relentless standardization of base operational processes serves as the bedrock for nuanced, nimble responsiveness to real time threats.
Healthcare infection prevention programs (HIPPs) should identify stakeholders from the local health department, emergency department, microbiology, hospital leadership, emergency management, UPU team (if applicable), and both nursing and physician leaders a priori with clear expectations for whom to contact, when, and via what mechanisms. Collectively, these stakeholders must establish regular communication plans. The use of existing communication infrastructure within the healthcare system along with preproduced resources (eg, fact sheets and key messages) that can be tailored to the 2019 nCoV will expedite information sharing. 1 Similar to communications between health department and hospital leaders, communication with healthcare workers (HCW) should be explicit and the information provided should be frequent, focused, and current. Frequent communications ensure that HCWs feel they have the correct information, which can limit the spread of misinformation. The healthcare system's default posture should include the assumption that a novel pathogen is transmissible and poses a threat. Healthcare team members must feel that the HIPP and leadership are responding with both urgency and concern.
Efforts to quickly detect, respond to, and manage an outbreak depend largely on the availability of reliable communication infrastructure that can support the optimization of decision making for stakeholders. The establishment of preapproved, systematic protocols to guide decision making is critical. Teams that initiate communications must have the appropriate protocols, procedures, contact lists, and paging numbers to initiate coordination of communication that include up to date, off hour contact details in the communications plan and set the expectation for frequency of follow up during the initial communications.
Options to coordinate with key stakeholders range from e mail communications and exchange of informational materials to joint decision making meetings. These meetings need to be both reliable and flexible, allowing stakeholders to participate according to the specific nature of the situation. Teleconference or face to face meetings may be appropriate based on the specific challenge and the groups involved. Web based, secure communication systems may also be helpful as a means of providing input and exchanging materials and information.
To minimize chaos, make the management structure explicit A comprehensive all hazards approach and a well developed emergency preparedness plan are crucial to providing streamlined and consistent messaging. Equally essential is a predetermined, hierarchical chain of command that incorporates the local organizational structure to ensure a maximally organized response. Standardization and establishment of clear roles, expectations, and accountability for the leadership team members empowers each team member to participate in a fully organized and efficient"	0

1563	"The COVID 19 pandemic of 2020 prompted stringent mitigation measures to ""flatten the curve"" quickly leading to an asphyxiated US economy as a national side effect. There are severe drawbacks to this strategy. The resulting flattened curve remains exponential and always under utilizes available healthcare capacity with a chance of still overburdening it. Moreover, while a mitigation strategy involving isolation and containment can scale down infections, it not only prolongs the outbreak significantly, but also leaves a susceptible population in its wake that's ripe for a secondary outbreak. Since economic activity is inversely proportional to mitigation, curtailing the outbreak with sustained mitigation can stifle the economy severely with disastrous repercussions. Full mitigation for the duration of an outbreak is therefore unsustainable and, overall, a poor solution with potentially catastrophic consequences that could've been avoided. A new strategy, coined a ""Method for Active Pandemic Curve Management"", or MAPCM, presented herein can shape the outbreak curve in a controlled manner for optimal utilization of healthcare resources during the pandemic, while drastically shortening the outbreak duration compared to mitigation by itself without trading off lives. This method allows mitigation measures to be relaxed gradually from day one, which enables economic activity to resume gradually from the onset of a pandemic. Since outbreak curves (such as hospitalizations) can be programmed using this method, they can also be shaped to accommodate changing needs during the outbreak; and to build herd immunity without the damaging side effects. The method can also be used to ease out of containment. MAPCM is a method and not a model. It is compatible with any appropriate outbreak model; and herein it is illustrated in examples using a hybrid logistic model."	0
1564	There were 27 novel coronavirus pneumonia cases found in Wuhan, China in December 2019, named as 2019 nCoV temporarily and COVID 19 formally by WHO on 11 th February, 2020. In December 2019 and January 2020, COVID 19 has spread in large scale among the population, which brought terrible disaster to the life and property of the Chinese people. In this paper, we will first analyze the feature and pattern of the virus transmission, and discuss the key impact factors and uncontrollable factors of epidemic transmission based on public development so as to provide theoretical support for the Chinese government in the decision making of epidemic prevention and recovery of economic production. Further, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the prevention methods taken by the Chinese government such as multi level administrative region isolation. It is of great importance and practical significance for the world to deal with public health emergencies.	1

More than 100 genes for SLE have been identified but they explain only ~15% of heritability. GWAS are challenged by risk genes of modest effect. Using locus based GWAS mapping and multiple gene expression replications, DDX11 was identified as a novel SLE gene. DDX11, repressed in SLE, may be used as a clinical diagnostic tool.
Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) explain only ~15% of genetic risk, indicating genes of modest effect remain to be discovered. Association clustering methods such as OASIS are more apt at identifying modest genetic effects. 410 genes were mapped to previously identified OASIS GWAS SLE loci and investigated for expression in SLE GEO datasets. GSE50395 dataset from Cordoba was used for validation.
Blood eQTL for significant SNPs in SLE loci and STRING for functional pathways of differentially expressed genes was used. Confirmatory qPCR on monocytes of 12 SLE patients and controls was performed. We identified 55 genes that were differentially expressed in at least 2 SLE GEO datasets with all probes directionally aligned.
DDX11 was downregulated in both GEO (P=3.60E 02) and Cordoba (P=8.02E 03) datasets and confirmed by qPCR (P=0.001). The most significant SNP, rs3741869 (P=3.2E 05) in OASIS locus 12p11.21, containing DDX11, was a cis eQTL regulating DDX11 expression (P=8.62E 05). DDX11 interacted with multiple genes including STAT1/STAT4. Genomic convergence with OASIS and multiple expression datasets identifies novel genes. DDX11, RNA helicase involved in genome stability, is repressed in SLE."	0
1567	Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the host receptor for SARScoronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) which has infected millions world wide and likely caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. Utilizing transcriptomic data from four cohorts taken from Crohn's disease (CD) and non inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subjects, we observed evidence of increased ACE2 mRNA in ileum with demographic features that have been associated with poor outcomes in COVID 19 including age and raised BMI. ACE2 was downregulated in CD compared to controls in independent cohorts. Within CD, ACE2 expression was reduced in inflamed ileal tissue and also remarkably, from un involved tissue in patients with a worse prognosis in both adult and pediatric cohorts. In active CD, small bowel ACE2 expression was restored by anti TNF therapy particularly in anti TNF responders. Collectively our data suggest that ACE2 downregulation is associated with inflammation and worse outcomes in CD.	0

1569	Recently the World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS Cov 2) as a pandemic, and declared it as Public Health Emergency of International Concern. More than 683,536 positive cases and 32,139 deaths caused by novel corona virus 2019 (COVID 19) has affected 199 countries and territories. This pandemic can transform into an extremely destructive form if we still do not take it seriously. In the present study, we propose a generalized SEIR model of COVID 19 to study the behaviour of its transmission under different control strategies. In the model, all possible cases of human to human transmission are taken care and its reproduction number is formulated to analyse accurate transmission dynamics of the coronavirus outbreak. Optimal control theory is applied in the model to pretend the impact of various intervention strategies, including voluntary quarantine, isolation of infected individuals, improving an individual's immunity and hospitalisation. Also, effect of the control strategies on model is analysed graphically by simulating the model numerically.	1

1571	The recent outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) in Wuhan, China, underscores the need for understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses in humans. Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human infecting viruses like SARS CoV and MERS CoV, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene. We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the SARS CoV 2 involving the RBD. As a result of this recombination event, SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2 share a similar genotype in RBD, including two insertions (positions 432 436 and 460 472), and alleles 427N and 436Y. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that interacts with the human ACE2 receptor. Ancestral state analyses revealed that SARS CoV 2 differentiated from its most recent common ancestor with RaTG13 by accumulating a significant number of amino acid changes in the RBD. In sum, we propose a two hit scenario in the emergence of the SARS CoV 2 virus whereby the SARS CoV 2 ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS CoV by incorporation of a SARS like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, the lineage that led to SARS CoV 2 accumulated further, unique changes specifically in the RBD.	0
1572	In order to anticipate a future trends in the development of the novel coronavirus COVID 19 epidemic started early at march 13, in the french overseas department Mayotte, we consider in this paper a modified deterministic and stochastic epidemic model. The model divides the total population into several possible states or compartment : susceptible (S), exposed (E) infected and being under an incubation period, infected (I) being infectious, simple or mild removed R M , severe removed (including hospitalized) R S and death cases (D). The adding of the two new compartment R M and R S are driven by data which together replace the original R compartment in the classical SEIR model. We first fit the constant transmission rate parameter to the epidemic data in Mayotte during an early exponential growth phase using an algorithm with a package of the software R and based on a Maximum Likewood estimator. This allows us to predict the epidemic without any control in order to understand how the control measure and public policies designed are having the desired impact of controlling the epidemic. To do this, we introduce a temporally varying decreasing transmission rate parameter with a control or quarantine parameter q. Then we pointed out some values of q to maintain control which is critical in Mayotte given the fragility of its health water.	0

1577	RNA knockdown in vivo carries significant potential for disease modelings and therapies. Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS Cov 2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr, in mouse hepatocytes. CasRx mediated simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes was also achieved by sgRNA arrays, providing a useful strategy to modulate complex metabolism networks. Moreover, the AAV (adeno associated virus) mediated delivery of CasRx and Pcsk9 sgRNAs into mouse liver successfully decreased serum PCSK9, resulting in significant reduction of serum cholesterol levels. Importantly, CasRx mediated knockdown of Pcsk9 is author/funder. All rights reserved.

1578	The COVID 19 outbreak has a tremendous impact on global health and the daily life of people still living in more than two hundred countries. The crucial action to gain the force in the fight of COVID 19 is to have powerful monitoring of the site forming infected patients. Most of the initial tests rely on detecting the genetic material of the coronavirus, and they have a poor detection rate with the timeconsuming operation. In the ongoing process, radiological imaging is also preferred where chest X rays are highlighted in the diagnosis. Early studies express the patients with an abnormality in chest X rays pointing to the presence of the COVID 19. On this motivation, there are several studies cover the deep learning based solutions to detect the COVID 19 using chest X rays. A part of the existing studies use non public datasets, others perform on complicated Artificial Intelligent (AI) structures. In our study, we demonstrate an AI based structure to outperform the existing studies. The SqueezeNet that comes forward with its light network design is tuned for the COVID 19 diagnosis with Bayesian optimization additive. Fine tuned hyperparameters and augmented dataset make the proposed network perform much better than existing network designs and to obtain a higher COVID 19 diagnosis accuracy.	0

We model the current scenario of closed schools and universities, social distancing of individuals above sixty years old and voluntary home quarantine to show that it led to a considerable reduction in the number of infections as compared with a scenario without any control measures. Notwithstanding, our model predicts that the current measures are not enough to avoid overloading the system.	0

1582	In order to effectively prevent the spread of COVID 19 virus, almost everyone wears a mask during coronavirus epidemic. This almost makes conventional facial recognition technology ineffective in many cases, such as community access control, face access control, facial attendance, facial security checks at train stations, etc. Therefore, it is very urgent to improve the recognition performance of the existing face recognition technology on the masked faces. Most current advanced face recognition approaches are designed based on deep learning, which depend on a large number of face samples. However, at present, there are no publicly available masked face recognition datasets. To this end, this work proposes three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face Detection Dataset (MFDD), Real world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD) and Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD). Among them, to the best of our knowledge, RMFRD is currently the world's largest real world masked face dataset. These datasets are freely available to industry and academia, based on which various applications on masked faces can be developed. The multigranularity masked face recognition model we developed achieves 95% accuracy, exceeding the results reported by the industry.

By fitting distributions of these quantities we design a parametric reinsurance contract whose trigger and cap are based on the probability distributions of the infection speed, death and fatality rates. In particular, fitting the distribution for the infection speed and death rates we provide a measure of the effectiveness of a state's action during an epidemic, and propose a reinsurance contract as a supplement to a state's social insurance to alleviate financial costs.	0

We consider the particular case of an infection which primarily spreads among people through proximal contact, via respiratory droplets. This smartphone application will be able to detect other devices in close proximity and list all the interactions in an anonymous and encrypted way. If an app user is tested positive and so is certified as infected, the application notifies immediately the potential contagion to the devices in the list and suggests to start a voluntary quarantine and undergo a medical test. We believe this solution may be particularly useful in the current COVID 19 pandemic and moreover could be used to prevent similar events in the future.	0

As we are in a learning phase of what COVID‐19 presents with and how the patients are different from SARS‐CoV‐affected cases reported in the past, it is difficult if not impossible, to predict any particular diagnostic neurological test to ascertain the high‐risk COVID‐19 patients with covert infections of the CNS.	0

Our goal is to prioritize antiviral activity to provide a solid evidence driven rationale for forthcoming clinical trials.
Since the most effective antiviral approaches are usually based on combined therapies that tackle the viral life cycle at different stages, we are also testing combinations of drugs that may be critical to reduce the emergence of resistant viruses. We will provide results as soon as they become available, so data should be interpreted with caution, clearly understanding the limitations of the in vitro model, that may not always reflect what could happen in vivo. Thus, our goal is to test the most active antivirals identified in adequate animal models infected with SARS CoV 2, to add more information about possible in vivo efficacy. In turn, successful antivirals could be tested in clinical trials as treatments for infected patients, but also as pre exposure prophylaxis to avoid novel infections until an effective and safe vaccine is developed. et al.

1594	When actively taking measures to control an epidemic, an important indicator of success is crossing the 'peak' of daily new infections. The peak is a positive sign which marks the end of the exponential phase of infection spread and a transition into a phase that is a manageable. Most countries or provinces with similar but independent growth trajectories had taken drastic measures for containing the COVID 19 pandemic and are eagerly waiting to cross the peak. However, the data after many weeks of strict measures suggests that most provinces instead enter a phase where the infections are in a linear growth. While the transition out of an exponential phase is relieving, the roughly constant number of daily new infections differ widely, range from around 50 in Singapore to around 2000 just in Lombardy (Italy), and 7600 in Spain. The daily new infection rate of a region seems to depend heavily on the time point in the exponential evolution when the restrictive measures were adopted, rather than on the population of the region. It is not easy to point the critical source of these persistent infections. We attempt to interpret this data using a simple model of newer infections mediated by asymptomatic patients, which underscores the importance of actively identifying any potential leakages in the quarantine. Given the novelty of the virus, it is hard to predict too far into the future and one needs to be observant to see if a plan B is needed as a second round of interventions. So far, the peak achieved flat.	0
1595	"Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS CoV 2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID 19, and serum antibody responses.
Methods We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory confirmed COVID 19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS CoV 2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.
Findings Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37 75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log 10 copies per mL (IQR 4·1 7·0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope  0·15, 95% CI  0·19 to  0·11; R²=0·71). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ρ=0·48, 95% CI 0·074 0·75; p=0·020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti RBD IgM (n=15). Anti SARS CoV 2 NP or anti SARS CoV 2 RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R²>0·9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.
Interpretation Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID 19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for highrisk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT qPCR for diagnosis."	0

1606	The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the COVID 19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human to human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019 nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409e7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128e1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588e13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th e 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.	0

1608	The number of Covid 19 cases is increasing dramatically worldwide. Therefore, the availability of reliable forecasts for the number of cases in the coming days is of fundamental importance. We propose a simple statistical method for short term real time forecasting of the number of Covid 19 cases and fatalities in countries that are latecomers  i.e., countries where cases of the disease started to appear some time after others. In particular, we propose a penalized (LASSO) regression with an error correction mechanism to construct a model of a latecomer in terms of the other countries that were at a similar stage of the pandemic some days before. By tracking the number of cases and deaths in those countries, we forecast through an adaptive rolling window scheme the number of cases and deaths in the latecomer. We apply this methodology to Brazil, and show that (so far) it has been performing very well. These forecasts aim to foster a better short run management of the health system capacity.	0

1611	Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID 19 has rapidly emerged as a global pandemic. This viral infection involves the upper respiratory tract and could lead to severe pneumonia with respiratory distress or even death. Certain studies have found higher initial plasma levels of most pro inflammatory cytokines during the course of the infection. In this context, both in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that metronidazole could decrease the levels of several cytokines, which are known to increase during the COVID 19 infection, including interleukin (IL)8, IL6, IL1B, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, IL12, IL1α, and interferon (IFN)γ, as well as the levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil count. Furthermore, the drug could decrease neutrophil generated reactive oxygen species during inflammation. Metronidazole could counteract majority of the immunopathological manifestations of the COVID 19 infection. Therefore, studies with a large sample size are required to determine the efficacy of metronidazole in the treatment of COVID 19 infection.	1
1612	By the end of January 2020, nearly 50,000 confirmed cases were reported in China, and the first confirmed cases were reported in Thailand, Nepal, Republic of Korea, the United States, Singapore, France, Vietnam, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Germany, The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Finland, Italy, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, the Russian Federation, Spain, Sweden, India, and the Philippines. In tissue cultures, remdesivir displayed half maximal effective concentrations (EC50s) of 0.069 μM for SARS CoV and 0.074 μM for MERS CoV.

Abstract Asthma is increasingly recognized as an underlying risk factor for severe respiratory disease in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) patients, particularly in the United States. Here, we report the postmortem lung findings from a 37 year old asthmatic man, who met the clinical criteria for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and died of COVID 19 less than two weeks after presentation to the hospital. His lungs showed mucus plugging and other histologic changes attributable to asthma, as well as early diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and a fibrinous pneumonia. The presence of DAD is similar to descriptions of autopsy lung findings from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), and the absence of a neutrophil rich acute bronchopneumonia differs from the histologic changes typical of influenza. The relative contribution of mucus plugging to his hypoxemia is unknown."	0
1615	"medRxiv preprint 2 Word count (abstract): 346 Word count (text): 2857 Abstract Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is straining the capacity of U.S. healthcare systems. Accurately identifying subgroups of hospitalized COVID 19 patients at high and low risk for complications would assist in directing resources.
Objective: To validate the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), a predictive model implemented in over 100 U.S. hospitals that has been recently promoted for use in COVID 19 patients.
We studied adult patients admitted with COVID 19 to non ICU level care at a large academic medical center from March 9 through April 7, 2020. We used the EDI, calculated at 15 minute intervals, to predict a composite adverse outcome of ICU level care, mechanical ventilation, or death during the hospitalization. In a subset of patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours, we also evaluated the ability of the EDI (range 0 100) to identify patients at low risk of experiencing this composite outcome during their remaining hospitalization. We evaluated model discrimination and calibration using both raw EDI scores and their slopes.
Results: Among 174 COVID 19 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 61 (35%) experienced the composite outcome. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the EDI was 0.76 (95% CI 0.68 0.84). Patients who met or exceeded an EDI of 64.8 made up 17% of the study cohort and had an 80% probability of experiencing the outcome during their hospitalization with a median lead time of 28 hours from when the threshold was first exceeded to the outcome. Employing the EDI slope lowered the AUCs to 0.68 (95% CI 0.60 0.77) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.59 0.75) for slopes calculated over 4 and 8 hours, respectively. In a subset of 109 patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours and who had not experienced the composite outcome, 14 (13%) patients who never exceeded an EDI of 37.9 had a 93% probability of not experiencing the outcome throughout the rest of their hospitalization, suggesting low risk."	0

1618	Background: Ventilator associated events are common in mechanically ventilated patients. They are associated with more days on mechanical ventilation, longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and increased risk of mortality. Theoretically, interventions that prevent ventilator associated events should also reduce associated morbidity. We evaluated the Comprehensive Unit based Safety Program approach to improve the care of mechanically ventilated patients. Methods: All mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU between October 1, 2015, and October 31, 2016, were prospectively monitored for the development of ventilator associated events according to the National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. A process care bundle (endotracheal intubation with subglottic suctioning, head of bed elevation 30°, target sedation scores, daily spontaneous awakening trials, spontaneous breathing trials), daily delirium assessment, and an early mobility protocol were instituted. The bundle compliance, ventilator associated events rates, ICU length of stay, and mortality rate were noted. The database allowed viewing of current rates, trends, and averages of all participating sites. Results: In the study period, 2,321 patients were admitted to the ICU, and 1,231 required mechanical ventilation (10,342 ventilator days). There were 115 ventilator associated events: 82 ventilator associated conditions, 15 infection related ventilator associated conditions, and 18 possible cases of ventilator associated pneumonia. The ICU mortality rate was 13.3%, compared with 28.7% for those mechanically ventilated patients with ventilator associated events (P = .0001). There was increased compliance for spontaneous awakening trials (51.5% 76.9%, P = .0008) and spontaneous breathing trials (54.2% 72.2%, P = .02) and a decrease in infection related ventilator associated conditions (4.2 3.5 per 1,000 days), possible cases of ventilator associated pneumonia (2.1 1.7 per 1,000 days), ICU mortality (45.3% 19.1%, P = .045), and	0

1620	Since mid December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) has been spreading from Wuhan, China. The confirmed COVID 19 patients in South Korea are those who came from or visited China. As secondary transmissions have occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns about community infections. The 54 year old male is the third patient diagnosed with COVID 19 in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on day 6 of admission. This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and three cases of tertiary transmission. Hereby, we report the clinical findings of the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China. Interestingly, after lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) was	1

1623	The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5 angstrom resolution cryo electron microscopy structure of the 2019 nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019 nCoV S protein binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS CoV RBD specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019 nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019 nCoV S should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.	1
1624	The purpose of the current systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral therapies in treatment of COVID 19. In addition, clinical trials on the efficacy of antiviral therapies in the management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS Cov) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) have also been reviewed, in order to identify potential treatment options for COVID 19. Method: An extensive search was performed in Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL databases until the end of March 15, 2020. Two independent researchers performed the screening, and finally the related studies were included. Results: Only one clinical trial on the efficacy of antiviral therapy in management of COVID 19 was found. The results depicted that adding Lopinavir Ritonavir to the standard treatment regimen of patients with severe COVID 19 has no benefits. Moreover, 21 case series and case report studies reported the prescription of antiviral agents in COVID 19, none of which can be used to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies in confronting COVID 19. In addition, no clinical trials were found to be performed on the efficacy of antiviral agents in the management of SARS CoV and MERS CoV. Conclusion: The current evidence impede researchers from proposing an appropriate antiviral therapy against COVID 19, making the current situation a serious concern for international organizations such as World Health Organization (WHO). In the time of the current pandemic and future epidemics, organizations such as WHO should pursue more proactive actions and plan well designed clinical trials so that their results can be used in managing future epidemics.	0

1626	"Background In the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.
We collected individual case data for patients who died from COVID 19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age based and location based under ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.
Findings Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9 19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9 28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56 3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23 1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27 0·38] in those aged <60 years vs 6·4% [5·7 7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2 15·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4 3·5] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8 11·1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39 1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0 7·6) in those aged 80 years or older.
Interpretation These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID 19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death."	0

1629	"The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 has activated top level response nationwide. We developed a new treatment model based on the online to offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients.
In this single centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected COVID 19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology.
The mean age of 48 patients was 39·08±13·88 years, 35(72·9%) were women. Compared with non hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(≥70years, 2·4% vs 33·3%, P<0·04).

The body temperature of non hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4 5. While dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. The lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non hospitalized patients.
Monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. Excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. The system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. This type of O2O, subjective to objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff.

1633	In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for analyzing and predicting the number of confirmed cases of COVID 19. Our model is a time dependent susceptibleinfected recovered (SIR) model that tracks two time series: (i) the transmission rate at time t and (ii) the recovering rate at time t. Our time dependent SIR method is better than the traditional static SIR model as it can adapt to the change of contagious disease control policies such as city lockdowns. Moreover, it is also more robust than the direct estimation of the number of confirmed cases, as a sudden change of the definition of the number of confirmed cases might result in a spike of the number of new cases. Using the data set provided by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (NHC) [2], we show that the one day prediction errors for the numbers of confirmed cases are less than 3% except the day when the definition of the number of confirmed cases is changed. Also, the turning point, defined as the day that the transmission rate is less than the recovering rate, is predicted to be Feb. 17, 2020. After that day, the basic reproduction number, known as the R0(t) value, is less than 1 if the current contagious disease control policies are maintained in China. In that case, the total number of confirmed cases is predicted to be less than 80, 000 cases in China under our deterministic model.	0

1636	Background: Since the first case of a novel coronavirus infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID 19 were found in Beijing. We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID 19 in Beijing. Methods: We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID 19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID 19 and 2003 SARS. Findings: By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID 19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service. Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days. As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID 19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%. Interpretation: On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID 19 infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non pneumonia cases in Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the next steps on the COVID 19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.	0
1637	SARS CoV 2, an enveloped virus with non segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome [3], is a member of the Coronaviridae (CoV) family which causes a predominantly respiratory illness with a wide range of clinical severity, ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgias, fatigue, and diarrhea) in a large proportion of patients to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fatal multi organ failure [1, 4–6, 7••]. A prior study demonstrated that cardiac injury and cardiovascular events in the form of elevated troponin and left ventricular systolic dysfunction are common post CAR T; in a cohort of 137 patients with post CAR T cytokine release syndrome (CRS), 21% had elevated troponin and 12% developed cardiovascular events including cardiac arrest, decompensated heart failure, and arrhythmias [65].

He had marked reactivity to stone fruits, nuts, and Cannabis components, which contain nsLTPs. The phenomenon of cross reactivity between C sativa and plant foods is known as ""Cannabis fruit/vegetable syndrome"" or ""LTP syndrome."" 5 Numerous studies have analyzed the nsLTP mediated cross reactivity between C sativa and stone fruits, such as peaches, nectarines, and plums, in addition to nuts, apples, and tomatoes. [5][6][7][8] The nsLTPs belong to the prolamin protein superfamily and provide protection against bacteria and fungi in plants. Given their important role in the plant defense system, these nsLTPs are highly conserved and, as a result, often cause clinical reactivity to multiple different foods in sensitized patients. 8 The nsLTPs are highly resistant to thermal stress and proteolysis, which could account for their ability to withstand digestion and cause more systemic reactions, although oral allergy syndrome also has been described. 9 Prior studies have suggested that nsLTP mediated reactivity is geographic, mainly in Europe. 5,8 Some reports have indicated sensitization to stone fruits in the wake of developing an allergy to marijuana. 5,10 In the present case, the history of stone fruit allergies preceded the development of anaphylaxis to C sativa components. This raises the novel possibility that the reverse sequence for nsLTP cross reactivity also might be relevant.
In summary, gathering a thorough allergy and social history is essential for patients reporting allergic symptoms to C sativa. Given expanding medical and recreational use, we anticipate that marijuana hypersensitivity will be a topic of growing importance in the field of allergy. Our case raises the possibility that, in addition to marijuana smoking and handling, nsLTP mediated stone fruit crossreactivity might be another ""gateway"" to C sativa sensitization."	0

El sistema renina angiotensina aldosterona (SRAA) es un importante regulador de la función cardiovascular y renal. Su bloqueo mediante los inhibidores de la enzima conversiva de la angiotensina (ECA) y/o los antagonistas del receptor de la angiotensina II se acompaña de una reducción de los valores de presión arterial, reducción del riesgo cardiovascular y enlentecimiento de la progresión de la insuficiencia renal. El descubrimiento de la ECA2, una enzima homóloga de la ECA encargada de la degradación de la angiotensina II a angiotensina 1 7, ofrece una nueva línea de estudio en el SRAA. La presente revisión expone la importancia de la ECA2 en diferentes órganos: el corazón, el pulmón y el riñón. A su vez, se detalla la importancia de dicha enzima mediante los diversos estudios realizados en modelos genéticamente manipulados con deleción del gen de la ECA2 y mediante la administración de un inhibidor de la ECA2. Los resultados de dichos estudios apuntan a un papel emergente de la ECA2 como una nueva diana terapéutica del SRAA.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and its emerging role in the regulation of the renin angiotensin system
The renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal function. Thus, RAS blockade with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and/or angiotensin receptor blocker decreases blood pressure, cardiovascular events, and delays the progression of kidney disease. The discovery of ACE2, a homologue of ACE, capable of degrading angiotensin II to angiotensin 1 7, may offer new insights into the RAS. In this review we discuss the possible protective role of ACE2 in different organs, namely heart, lungs and kidneys. The role of this enzyme is inferred from recent studies performed using genetically manipulated mice that lack the ACE2 gene and also mice treated with pharmacological ACE2 inhibitors. These results suggest that ACE2 might be a new therapeutic target within the RAS."	0

1647	This report highlights details on a pregnant case of COVID 19 who unfortunately did not survive. This 27 yearold woman at her 30 and 3/7 weeks' gestation was referred to our center with fever, myalgia, and cough. The laboratory investigations showed leukopenia and lymphopenia as well as increased creatinine and CRP levels. The first chest X ray (faint bilateral patchy opacities) and CT scan (some faint subpleural ground glass opacities associated with pleural thickening) were not typical for initial COVID 19 pulmonary infection, however, the treatment for COVID 19 was started. Due to respiratory distress, she was intubated and put under mechanical ventilation. After a while, the fetus was born with Apgar score of 0 and did not react to the neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol. Finally, due to deterioration in the clinical and imaging findings, the patient was expired as a result of multi organ failure. Following the death, autopsy was performed and the histopathologic evaluations of the lungs showed evidence of viral pneumonia (viral cytopathic effect and a mild increase in alveolar wall thickness) and ARDS (hyaline membrane). Also, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection in the lungs. To our knowledge, this	1

Asymptomatic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers' ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings. Although much is still unknown about SARS CoV 2, the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature, effective control, prevention and treatment of SARS CoV 2. Various reports have suggested an in vivo evolution of the virus, which may explain the rapid spread and changing epidemiology of SARS CoV 2, but further evidence is needed.
Unfortunately, no effective treatment or therapeutic drug is available for the disease; only supportive treatment and classical intervention measures are available for confronting the SARS CoV 2 pandemic."	1

Once again, they must balance patients' protection and defence and fight not only against the increased risks of COVID 19 infection but also against the temptations of ageism.

Together with our social, occupational, and personal life, the new corona virus poses novel challenges for all physicians, including dermatologists. Despite the virus not being dermatotropic, several skin conditions have emerged, mainly as a result of prolonged contact to personal protective equipment and excessive personal hygiene. Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itch, pressure urticaria, and exacerbation of pre existing skin diseases, including seborrheic dermatitis and acne, have been described. We have focused on the dermatologic aspects of COVID 19 infection, so that dermatologist may be aware of the skin complications and the preventive measures to be taken in the COVID 19 pandemic.

This suggests that dermatology departments and private offices should develop appropriate preventative measures. (5). Use of a sanitary mask itself may not be sufficient protection from the virus transmission, so that goggles should be used to decrease the risk of conjunctival contamination. COVID 19 has a relatively low resistance to disinfectants. As a result, a variety of regimens have been proven effective, ranging from 75% ethanol, peracetic acid, chlorine, and UV disinfection to a hot water bath at 56°C(132.8°F) for 30 minutes (4).
Another important practical concern is the care for patients with autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, lupus, scleroderma, and hidradenitis suppurativa, which may require immune suppressive therapy. It is not clear whether the administration of the biologics should be delayed.
The skin complications in COVID 19 infection are mainly due to the hyper hydration effect of PPE, friction, epidermal barrier breakdown, and contact reactions, all of which may aggravate an existing skin disease. The dermatologic manifestations are far different from those recorded during the Influenza Epidemic of 1918 1919 (6). Erythema, papules, maceration, and scaling are the most commonly reported skin changes due to extended wear of PPE (6) (figure 1).
Symptoms have included burning, itching, and stinging. Such findings have been attributed to the use of PPE in 97.0% of 542 frontline healthcare workers (HCWs). The most commonly affected skin sites were the nasal bridge (83% due to the use of protective goggles but not the Journal Pre proof"	0

We developed data driven susceptible exposed infectious quarantine recovered (SEIQR) models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown. Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95% CI: 379.8~381.0). With 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4~3.9) to 1.58 (95% CI: 1.34~2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95% CI: 2.43~2.63) to 1.65 (95% CI: 1.56~1.76). We found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland China. The number of infections could be reduced up to 98.9%, and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 99.3% as of Feb 23, 2020. However, earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect.

1657	The COVID 19 pandemic triggered by SARS CoV 2 is a worldwide health disaster. Main protease is an attractive drug target among coronaviruses, due to its vital role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. There is presently no exact drug or treatment for this diseases caused by SARS CoV 2. In the present study, we report the potential inhibitory activity of some FDA approved drugs against SARS CoV 2 main protease by molecular docking study to investigate their binding affinity in protease active site. Docking studies revealed that drug Oseltamivir (anti H1N1 drug), Rifampin (anti TB drug), Maraviroc, Etravirine, Indinavir, Rilpivirine (anti HIV drugs) and Atovaquone, Quinidine, Halofantrine, Amodiaquine, Tetracylcine, Azithromycin, hydroxycholoroquine (anti malarial drugs) among others binds in the active site of the protease with similar or higher affinity.

1658	There appears to be large regional variations for susceptibility, severity and mortality for Covid 19 infections. We set out to examine genetic differences in the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) gene, as its receptor serves as a cellular entry for SARS CoV 2. By comparing 56,885 Non Finnish European and 9,197 East Asians (including 1,909 Koreans) four missense mutations were noted in the hACE2 gene. Molecular dynamic demonstrated that two of these variants (K26R and I468V) may affect binding characteristics between S protein of the virus and hACE2 receptor. We also examined hACE2 gene expression in eight global populations from the HapMap3 and noted marginal differences in expression for some populations as compared to the Chinese population. However, for both of our studies, the magnitude of the difference was small and the significance is not clear in the absence of further in vitro and functional studies.	0

1661	Interventions: Anesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with suspected 2019 nCoV were drafted and applied in 4 hospitals in Wuhan. Measurements and Main Results: Cross infection in the operating rooms of the 4 hospitals was effectively reduced by implementing the new measures and procedures. The majority of patients with laboratory confirmed 2019 nCoV infection or suspected infection were female (23 [62%] of 37), and the mean age was 41.0 years old (standard deviation 19.6; range 4 78). 10 (27%) patients had chronic medical illnesses, including 4 (11%) with diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, and 8 (22%) with digestive system disease. Twenty five (68%) patients presented with lymphopenia, and 23 (62%) patients exhibited multiple mottling and ground glass opacity on computed tomography scanning.

Most of these attempts focus on collecting information about infected people, in order to help healthy people avoid contact with them.

That is, the authorities do not have an automated tool to recommend which decisions to make in order to maximize social distancing and to minimize the impact for the economy.

The standard Kingman coalescent model on genealogies  timed trees that represent the ancestry of the sample  is used in a generative model of molecular sequence variation to infer evolutionary parameters. However, the state space of Kingman's genealogies grows superexponentially with sample size n, making inference computationally unfeasible already for small n. We introduce a new coalescent model called Tajima heterochronous n coalescent with a substantially smaller cardinality of the genealogical space. This process allows to analyze samples collected at different times, a situation that in applications is both met (e.g. ancient DNA and RNA from rapidly evolving pathogens like viruses) and statistically desirable (variance reduction and parameter identifiability). We propose an algorithm to calculate the likelihood efficiently and present a Bayesian nonparametric procedure to infer the population size trajectory. We provide a new MCMC sampler to explore the space of Tajima's genealogies and model parameters. We compare our procedure with state of the art methodologies in simulations and applications.

In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS CoV 2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS CoV. By screening the experimentally determined SARS CoV derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS CoV 2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS CoV 2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China.

1671	The outbreak of COVID 19 has now become a global pandemic and it continues to spread rapidly worldwide, severely threatening lives and economic stability. Making the problem worse, there is no specific antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID 19 to date. SARS CoV 2 initiates its entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein. Therefore, molecules that can block SARS CoV 2 from binding to hACE2 may potentially prevent the virus from entering human cells and serve as an effective antiviral drug. Based on this idea, we designed a series of peptides that can strongly bind to SARS CoV 2 RBD in computational experiments. Specifically, we first constructed a 31mer peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from hACE2 (a.a. 22 44 and 351 357) with a linker glycine, and then redesigned the peptide sequence to enhance its binding affinity to SARS CoV 2 RBD. Compared with several computational studies that failed to identify that SARS CoV 2 shows higher binding affinity for hACE2 than SARS CoV, our protein design scoring function, EvoEF2, makes a correct identification, which is consistent with the recently reported experimental data, implying its high accuracy. The top designed peptide binders exhibited much stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild type ( 53.35 vs.  46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit for design and wild type, respectively). The extensive and detailed computational analyses support the high reasonability of the designed binders, which not only recapitulated the critical native binding interactions but also introduced new favorable interactions to enhance binding. Due to the urgent situation created by COVID 19, we share these computational data to the community, which should be helpful to develop potential antiviral peptide drugs to combat this pandemic. : bioRxiv preprint 13 exposed to the bulk solvent.

1672	"Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 2 Abstract
Activation Induced cytidine Deaminase (AID) initiates affinity maturation and isotype switching by deaminating deoxycytidines within immunoglobulin genes, leading to somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination. AID thus potentiates the humoral response to clear pathogens. Marking the 20th anniversary of the discovery of AID, we synthesize the current understanding of AID function. We discuss AID biochemistry and how error free forms of DNA repair are co opted to prioritize mutagenesis over accuracy during antibody diversification. We discuss the regulation of DNA double strand break repair pathway during class switch recombination. We describe genomic targeting of AID as a multilayered process involving chromatin architecture, cis and trans acting factors, and determining mutagenesis  distinct from AID occupancy at loci that are spared from mutation.

Antibodies are essential to clearing viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections, as well as neutralizing toxins. The ability of Activation Induced cytidine Deaminase (AID) to enhance antibody affinity through somatic hypermutation (SHM) and alter the effector function of antibodies through class switch recombination (CSR) is vital to these tasks (see below). In addition, the generation of a long lasting antigen specific antibody memory response is crucial to establishing immunity against pathogens, and AID plays a key role in this endeavor by engraving memories of past pathogen experience through genetic modifications of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Here, we review the most essential findings on AID since its discovery two decades ago by providing a timely update on the molecular mechanisms of AID in B cell antibody production. As this review was written during the period that the world was engulfed by the COVID 19 pandemic caused by Coronavirus SARS CoV 2, we hope it will provide background to inspire vaccine design and the generation of therapeutic antibodies against SARS CoV 2, as well as inevitable future pathogens.
Vertebrates have evolved elegant genetic mechanisms to produce a repertoire of antibodies capable of recognizing and neutralizing a potentially unlimited number of foreign pathogens.
Prior to antigen exposure, site specific recombination of germline immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments during B cell development provides the primary antibody repertoire [1] . The processes of SHM, gene conversion (GCV), and CSR further diversify this antibody repertoire upon B cell cognate antigen interactions. In antigen activated B cells, SHM introduces point mutations in the Ig variable (V) region of both Ig heavy (Igh) and light chains to enable the process of affinity maturation in the germinal center of secondary lymphoid organs. GCV is an alternative mechanism of altering antibody specificity and affinity in select vertebrate species, including rabbits and birds. GCV involves the production of singlestranded DNA breaks or double stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) within the rearranged V(D)J region, triggering a homologous recombination like process that repairs the lesion using IgV pseudogenes. This produces templated sequence alterations within the V region. CSR is a Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 4 region specific deletional recombination event whereby the exons encoding for the immunoglobulin IgM constant region within the Igh are replaced with a downstream constant region without changing the antigen binding specificity, thereby altering the effector functions of the antibody. While all three processes are distinct genetic transactions, they share some common features, such as transcription of their target sequence [2] , and preferential mutation of RGYW/WRCY motifs (where W=A/T, R=A/G, Y=C/T), wherein the underlined G/C is mutated [3] . While not demonstrated until the discovery of AID, these and other specific similarities suggested a common inception to each of these processes.
AID was identified by Tasuku Honjo 's group in 1999 [4], and shown to be essential for SHM and CSR in both mice and humans in 2000 [5, 6] , and later for GCV in chicken DT40 B lymphoma cell line [7] . Variable lymphocyte receptor diversification in ancient jawless vertebrates also depends on an AID like cytidine deaminases named CDA1 and CDA2 [8] , indicating that diversification of antigen receptors by deamination is an ancestral mechanism in vertebrates.
AID was originally proposed to be an RNA editing enzyme due to sequence homology to its paralog, the RNA cytosine deaminase Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC 1) [4] . However, the DNA deamination model which proposes that AID promotes antibody diversity by deaminating deoxycytidine (dC) to deoxyuridine (dU) within Ig genes is currently supported by significant experimental evidence [9] .
Purified AID preferentially mutates dC within the WRCY motif [10, 11]. As this motif is preferentially mutated during SHM in vivo [12] , this result provides strong evidence supporting the DNA deamination model for AID function. Biochemical data suggest that AID is catalytically inefficient [13, 14] . The low catalytic rate has been proposed to act as an evolutionary safeguard to limit the mutagenic activity of AID [11]. Moreover, the accessibility of AID's catalytic pocket appears to be a key determinant of AID's catalytic rate [15] . AID has been suggested to act on single stranded DNA (ssDNA) by inducing multiple deaminations per binding event [10]. A single molecule resolution Förster resonance energy Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 5 transfer (FRET) study visualized the ssDNA scanning motion of AID, and suggested that the enzyme was able to move bidirectionally while remaining bound to the same ssDNA [16]. This behavior of AID on ssDNA may play a role in enhancing mutagenic repair by overwhelming faithful DNA repair (see below).
Modeling AID on pre existing structures of APOBEC enzymes [15] and crystallizing truncated AID variants [17, 18] have provided valuable structural details. X ray structure analysis with human monomeric AID reveals that AID prefers to bind and deaminate structured substrates, such as G quadruplex (G4) structures that can form at the Switch (S) region, over linear ssDNA substrates [18 20] (see Box 1). However, as such structures are rare, especially over diverse IgV exons, it is likely that other structures are also acted upon by AID, such as short patches of melted DNA [21] . These X ray structure studies suggested that AID contains a bifurcated nucleic acid binding surface [15, 18] : one required for catalysis, and another positively charged surface in AID helix6, thought to play a role in recognizing structured substrates. A similar bifurcated nucleic acid binding surface has been identified in APOBEC3H, mediating dimerization [22]. Besides facilitating substrate binding, specific arginine residues in AID helix6 may underpin a licensing mechanism that links AID to transcription elongation and warrants productive targeting [23]. Nevertheless, biochemical, biophysical and structural approaches have provided valuable knowledge on AID targeting mechainsms during SHM and CSR (see below). A detailed summary of the structure function description of AID can be found in [9] .
Uracils introduced in DNA are normally repaired faithfully, restoring the original DNA sequence ( Figure 1 ). This is not the case during SHM, GCV or CSR, whereby the initiating AID induced lesion promotes further mutagenesis that benefits affinity maturation by providing a widerange of amino acid changes, or causes DNA breaks that trigger recombination events. Why faithful repair of DNA uracils is subverted during SHM has been the subject of intense investigation. The majority of the uracils in the genome are faithfully repaired by the base Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 6 excision repair (BER) pathway: excision of uracils by uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG); incision at the resulting abasic sites by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1; processing of the abasic sites by DNA polymerase β, followed by sealing of the final nick by DNA ligase 3 [24]. Uracils escaping detection by UNG or single strand selective monofunctional uracil DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG1) can be copied over by the replication machinery, producing transition mutations at G:C base pairs (Figure 1) [25, 26]. However, during SHM, the later steps of BER are circumvented, for reasons that are not fully clear (see Outstanding Questions). Replication across the noninstructive abasic site by the translesional DNA polymerases REV1 and Pol η generates both transition and transversion mutations at G:C pairs [27, 28] (Figure 1). Indeed, mice deficient in UNG (Ung  / ) exhibit reduced transversion mutations at G:C pairs in Ig V regions relative to wildtype (WT) mice, with a minor impact on mutagenesis at A:T base pairs [29]. Mismatch repair (MMR) also mediates repair of uracil lesions, detected as U:G mispairs. Replication associated canonical MMR (cMMR) is traditionally a high fidelity process that preserves genomic stability. cMMR begins with the recognition of a base mispair by the MutSα heterodimer complex (MSH2/MSH6), followed by the recruitment of MutLα complex (MLH1/PMS2) and the activation of the endonuclease activity of PMS2, and removal of a track of the DNA strand by exonuclease EXO1 [30, 31]. The resynthesis of the ssDNA gap by high fidelity replicative polymerases restores the original DNA sequences. Instead, during SHM, a subverted MMR pathway termed non canonical MMR (ncMMR) using the translesion DNA Polymerase  is largely responsible for mutations at A:T base pairs [31 37] (Figure 1). Mutagenic ncMMR is largely linked to AID lesions, as non AID targets are faithfully repaired by MMR [38]. Recent work by a number of groups has shed light on ncMMR, whereby the UNG/SMUG1 and MMR pathways converge and work collaboratively to facilitate A:T and G:C mutagenesis [39 43]. This view is supported by findings that both UNG and ncMMR are able to function in the G1 phase of the cell cycle [41, 42], where AID activity peaks [44]. Hence, the introduction of an abasic site within the EXO1 excision track induces translesional repair and mutations at A:T base pairs. This can arise in a number of ways: EXO1 excises the wrong strand of an AID induced G:U mismatch, thereby exposing dU on the ssDNA track to uracil excision by UNG or SMUG1. Alternatively, AID disrupts cMMR by deaminating a dC within the EXO1 Journal Pre proof The NHEJ cascade The Ku70/80 complex, XRCC4, and Ligase 4 (Lig4) represent the ""core"" NHEJ factors based on their exclusive role in end joining. Upon AID induced S region DSB formation, the Mre11 Rad50 Nbs1 (MRN) sensor kinase complex binds DSBs and recruits the ataxia telangiectasia Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 8 mutated (ATM) kinase to the break site. ATM phosphorylates numerous substrates, leading to cell cycle arrest, as well as phosphorylating histone H2AX, which stimulates a cascade of events leading to the recruitment of 53BP1 to chromatin flanking the DSB [50, 51]. 53BP1 promotes NHEJ and CSR by preventing DSB end resection [52] through the recruitment of Rif1 [53 56] and Shieldin, a protein complex composed of Shld1, Shld2, Shld3, and Rev7 [57 62] (Figure 2B). How the Shieldin complex prevents DNA end resection is still not clear, but it requires the binding of Shld2 to ssDNA exposed at DSBs [63] (see Outstanding Questions). After end processing, Lig4 and XRCC4 ligate the two DNA ends [64]. Alt EJ DSBs generated during CSR are also repaired by the Alt EJ pathway [47]. Factors that are implicated in Alt EJ include CtIP [65, 66], which seems to have a role in end processing, XRCC1, ligase 1 and ligase 3, which are involved in end joining [67, 68]. HMCES (5 Hydroxymethylcytosine binding, ES cell specific) acts as an abasic site sensor in ssDNA [69], and also functions in the Alt EJ pathway during CSR [70]. HMCES defective mouse primary B cells and CH12F3 cells have shown reduced microhomology usage in switch junctions relative to WT cells [70]. This finding has been postulated to be mechanistically due to HMCES's ability to bind ssDNA overhangs, likely caused by strand resection of DSB at the S regions, through its SOSresponse associated peptidase domain [71].
The mechanism by which AID preferentially mutates Ig genes is still incompletely understood (see Outstanding questions). This issue has implications for immunity as well as for the oncogenic mutations introduced by AID outside the Ig loci [72] . AID targeting entails successive steps of increasing specificity: entering the nucleus, associating quite extensively to chromatin, and mutating Ig loci at a high frequency, in addition to a small fraction of other genes at low (but significant) frequency.
Chromatin organization into topologically associated domains (TADs) can contribute to AID activity by bringing together distant DNA regions, as exemplified by chromatin extrusion to ensure CSR directionality [91]. Deletional CSR requires long range interactions between the donor (Eμ) and acceptor (E acc ) S regions enhancers, and the Igh 3' regulatory region (3'RR) [92].
The loop extrusion mechanism envisages cohesin loading cis elements in the Igh, drawing the Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 12 3'RR and Eμ together to form a CSR center. Transcription of an acceptor S region induced by cytokine signaling would expose E acc cohesin binding sites, driving chromatin extrusion for juxtaposing the E acc with the CSR center, and thus arranging distal AID induced DSBs in a direction favorable for deletional CSR. Additionally, long range inter TAD interactions promoted by non coding RNA can contribute to AID function. Specifically, disrupting transcription by CRISPR/Cas9 on a TAD containing a long non coding RNA that is 2.6 Mb away from the Igh is sufficient to halve the efficiency of CSR to IgA in mouse Peyer's patch B cells and in the CH12F3 B cell line [93] .
Since neither transcription, AID occupancy, or the presence of super enhancers are sufficient to predict mutation susceptibility of a gene, additional features must contribute to define susceptibility to AID. The presence of cis elements, the quality of transcription, the formation of DNA/RNA structures, and a licensing mechanism coupling AID to transcription elongation have been proposed [94] (reviewed below).
Ig loci are privileged for SHM [95] , implying that AID is preferentially targeted to and/or more active at those loci. The cause of this preference is still unclear but is independent of the Ig promoter. Ig loci have strong enhancers and are highly transcribed, and at least the Igh locus harbors a super enhancer [81] . Ig enhancers contain defined evolutionarily conserved elements, known as DIVAC (diversification activators), that are sufficient to attract SHM to a juxtaposed transcribed sequence [96] . DIVACs can affect mutability at the TAD level [97] . Thus, the insertion of a DIVAC into an otherwise non targeted TAD can attract SHM, as shown in the Ramos B cell line [97] . In this study, adjacent TADs were spared, additionally suggesting a topologically delineated confinement of AID mutagenesis [97] . The same study found that some AID off target genes have associated enhancers with DIVAC activity [97] , which may explain why they are colaterally mutated by AID. Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 13 The mechanism of DIVAC activity is unclear. Evidence in the DT40 and Ramos B cell lines suggests that recruitment of different transcription factors to DIVACs enhances SHM without an effect on transcription[96, 97]. Nevertheless, their relative contribution remains to be dissected. DIVACs are transcribed, producing enhancer RNA (eRNA) from both strands [97].
Bidirectional transcription, either convergent (as discussed above) or divergent, and eRNA processing by the RNA exosome [89] can contribute to the AID targeting activity of the DIVAC ( Figure 3C,D) . Although eRNA has not been shown to be a universal feature of AID targets, it is possible that some intragenic AID off target sites are due to bidirectional transcription driven by overlapping intragenic enhancers [88, 89].
RNAPII and its processivity factor SPT5 are required for AID activity and colocalize with AID genome wide [23, 98] . SPT5 mediates the AID RNAPII interaction and is sufficient to recruit AID to chromatin [23, 98] . The function of SPT5 is to initially cause promoter proximal pausing of RNAPII [99] , and is thus enriched immediately downstream from the transcription start site (TSS). AID shows a similar genome wide pattern by chromatin immunoprecipitations sequencing (ChIP seq) in primary B cells, consistent with its accumulation at SPT5 rich sites (Box 2) [82, 98] . During transcription elongation, SPT5 remains associated with and acts as a positive factor for elongating RNAPII; thus, both accumulate inside gene bodies upon transcriptional stalling, a phenomenon considered key for AID activity [90, 98, 100, 101]. Accordingly, stalled RNAPII and SPT5 are found within gene bodies at the Ig V and S regions, as well as at some AID off targets [72, 100, 102], which could recruit AID to stalled transcription [98, 100]. However, SPT5 is still abundant at the Ig constant regions and at many genes that are occupied by AID, but spared from mutation [80, 81, 88, 98] . Since AID is an inefficient enzyme in vitro, RNAPII stalling via SPT5 or RNA DNA structures might not only expose ssDNA but also provide time for AID to work [15, 90] (see Figure 3C ). DNA RNA R loops or G4 DNA formed during transcription can stall RNAPII [103], and in fact, are preferred AID substrates in vitro [20] ; this might in turn contribute to AID susceptibility at certain loci. Another targeting mechanism has been proposed in which G4 RNA formed in the intron of the S region transcript binds AID and brings it to the Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 14 complementary DNA [104, 105] (Box 1). However, while R loops and G4 can form in the Sregion and some AID off targets such as Myc [19, 20, 89], their presence at the Ig V and at other AID off targets, is unlikely and uncertain, respectively; therefore, other mechanisms must be at play for SHM [20] (Box 1). Transcriptional stalling may cause premature termination, another potential source of ssDNA demonstrated at the Ig V [101]. In addition, transcription induced DNA supercoiling also provides ssDNA substrate to AID [106].
The identification of catalytically active AID mutants that can occupy the Ig promoter, but not the gene body, and fail to enable SHM or CSR, has suggested a model in which AID is recruited by SPT5 to promoter proximal paused RNAPII; in this model, AID gains access to the gene body by traveling with transcription elongation [23]. Supporting the link between AID activity and transcription elongation, factors that interact with RNAPII after the pause release, namely SPT5, RNAPII associated Factor (PAF) and the histone chaperones SPT6 and Faciliates chromatin transcription (FACT), are important for SHM and/or CSR, and biochemically co purify with AID [72, 107, 108] . Whether histone chaperones facilitate AID activity at the Ig by their role in transcription or by defining histone modifications, is unclear. Of note, the RNA exosome has been linked to elongating RNAPII via SPT6 in Drosophila sp. cells [109] which may facilitate AID activity. A more precise understanding of how the transition from transcriptional pausing/stalling to elongation has an impact on AID activity is required. A speculative model integrating several observations would have AID accessing the gene body with elongating RNAPII, but only being able to mutate genes in which the transcriptional and genomic contexts cause simultaneous RNAPII stalling and ssDNA exposure (see Figure 3C and Outstanding Questions). In addition, the dissociation of AID from Ig loci to prevent mutation of constant regions must be somehow regulated   a step that has received little attention.

1673	The novel Coronavirus of 2019 caused an ongoing pandemic with over 400, 000 confirmed cases and large variability in its reported case fatality rates (CFRs), which are proportions of fatal cases among demographic groups. The relative CFRs between groups and countries are key ratios that guide policy decisions regarding scarce medical resource allocation. In the middle of an active outbreak, estimating this measure involves correcting for time and severity dependent reporting of cases as well as time lags in observed patient outcomes. In this work, we argue that we must make up for lost information about time when estimating the relative CFR: without inferring the time dependent balance between reporting rates of fatal and non fatal cases, CFR estimators can perform badly. To make this argument rigorous, we carry out a theoretical analysis of some current estimators of CFR. We then adapt a previously developed methodbased on the well known expectation maximization (EM) technique for COVID 19 reporting. Our analysis is supplemented by numerical results and an open source implementation. This should enable epidemiologists and other analysts to fit likelihood based models similar to the ones we propose as remedies for the biased nature distribution.	0
1674	"We have developed a novel detection system which couples CRISPR Cas recognition of target sequences, Cas mediated nucleic acid probe cleavage, and quantum dots as highly sensitive reporter molecules for instrument free detection of viral nucleic acid targets. After target recognition and Cas mediated cleavage of biotinylated ssDNA probe molecules, the probe molecules are bound to magnetic particles. A complimentary ssDNA oligonucleotide quantum dot conjugate is then added, which only hybridizes to un cleaved probes on the magnetic beads. After separation of hybridized from unhybridized quantum dot conjugates by magnetic sequestration, the signal is measured fluorometrically to provide a signal proportional to the cleaved probes and therefore the amount of target nucleic acid. To demonstrate the power of this assay, a 250 bp DNA target sequence matching a portion of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) genome is used and a detection limit of ~0.5 nM is achieved without target amplification using a simple portable ultraviolet flashlight. The positive samples are readily confirmed by visual inspection, completely avoiding the need for complicated devices and instruments. This work establishes the feasibility of a simple, instrument free assay for rapid nucleic acid screening in both hospitals and pointof care settings.

Although these tests are highly sensitive and accurate, they require a laboratory setting for use, bulky instruments, sophisticated operations, and they are therefore not field deployable. These issues present a significant bottleneck to rapid and widespread testing, hindering our ability to respond to emerging pandemics. Recently, rapid POC systems using isothermal amplification have been demonstrated for viral pathogen detection 13 , however they have limited throughput and poor sensitivity. Given the limitations of existing viral pathogen testing methods, there is a significant need for simpler testing methodologies that do not require complex instrumentation, and that can be performed easily in the field.
An ideal POC device that can combat modern era pandemic crises should be simple, inexpensive, accurate, and must be easily operated and understood by people without special training. A recently discovered technology called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in conjunction with CRISPR associated proteins (Cas) has shown great promise as an alternative to 15 . This method is significantly simpler than RT PCR since it does not require complex instrumentation to perform. Certain Cas nucleases such as Cas12a and Cas13a can be activated to indiscriminately cleave single stranded DNA or RNA substrates once they identify and bind with the target DNA or RNA 16,17 . The activated Cas enzymes cleave a nucleic acid probe, releasing a fluorophore author/funder. All rights reserved.

CRISPR Cas systems have also been linked with isothermal amplification methods to achieve highly sensitive and specific detection of pathogens 18,19 .
However, most CRISPR Cas detection systems utilize reporter probes with organic dyes that require external instruments and possess a high fluorescence background, which limits overall sensitivity 20 .
In this study, we develop a novel probe system for CRISPR Cas nucleic acid assays which use quantum dot as a reporter. Compared to conventional organic fluorescence dyes, Qdots have unique electronic and optical properties such as stable signal intensity, narrow emission spectrum, continuous broad excitation spectrum, and high quantum yields, making them an ideal fluorescence indicator for in vitro diagnostics 21,22 . After target recognition and Cas mediated cleavage of biotinylated ssDNA probe molecules, the probe molecules are bound to streptavidin coated magnetic particles. A complimentary ssDNA oligonucleotide quantum dot conjugate is then added, which only hybridizes to un cleaved probes on the magnetic beads. After separation of hybridized from unhybridized quantum dot conjugates by magnetic sequestration, the signal is measured fluorometrically to provide a signal proportional to the cleaved probes and therefore the amount of target nucleic acid. Our use of magnetic particle sequestration effectively reduces background signal, enabling use highly sensitive quantum dots as reporters. As a proof of principle for viral pathogen detection, a double stranded DNA segment matching a portion of the African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) genome was selected as the detection target. Without target amplification, we achieved a detection limit of 0.5 nM by using a small and inexpensive UV flashlight as the excitation source. This simple and instrument free protocol pave the way for next generation POC and field deployable viral pathogen detection applications. Fig. 1a shows the workflow of the Qdots CRISPR based fluorometric nucleic acid detection.
Oligonucleotide DNA linker probes with a biotin label are mixed with a Cas12a crRNA complex. With the presence of a double stranded target DNA (part of the ASFV genome), the Cas12a crRNA complex is activated and indiscriminately cleaves the single stranded linker probes in the assay.

Using our Qdot CRISPR based DNA detection strategy, we report a very low detection background compared to conventional CRISPR Cas systems that use fluorophore quencher substrate as reporters. The cleaved ssDNA probes linked to the Qdots are detected by isolating the magnetic beads, thus avoiding the high background issues from the uncleaved fluorophore quencher probes in the assay. This is essential to enhance the overall detection sensitivity of CRISPR Cas systems, and is especially useful for instrumentfree detection in resource limited environments 29,30 .
Currently, our approach can achieve a detection limit of ~0.5 nM without any target amplification. To improve the sensitivity, our assay can be easily integrated with established isothermal nucleic acids amplification methods such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) 31,15 or Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) 32,33 to extend the detection limit to attomolar level. The amplification reagents can be mixed with CRISPR Cas12a protein and crRNA as a ""one pot"" assay.
Furthermore, our assay is poised to be developed for high throughput multiplexing detection purposes.
Because CRISPR Cas12a assay is an indiscriminate DNase activity 14,34 , linker probe A and reporter probe B can be used as universal reporters for the detection of various DNA targets by only changing the crRNA sequence to match the target sequence. In addition, Cas13a protein demonstrates a similar indiscriminate RNase activity as Cas12a 35,16 . Thus, our assay presented here should be able to detect both DNA and RNA targets for multiplexing detection.

1675	Finding novel biomarkers for human pathologies and predicting clinical outcomes for patients is rather challenging. This stems from the heterogenous response of individuals to disease which is also reflected in the inter individual variability of gene expression responses. This in turn obscures differential gene expression analysis (DGE). In the midst of the COVID 19 pandemic, we wondered whether an alternative to DGE approaches could be applied to dissect the molecular nature of a host response to infection exemplified here by an analysis of H1N1 influenza, community/hospital acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. To this end, we turned to the analysis of ensemble gene noise. Ensemble gene noise, as we defined it here, represents a variance within an individual for a collection of genes encoding for either members of known biological pathways or subunits of annotated protein complexes. From the law of total variance, ensemble gene noise depends on the stoichiometry of the ensemble genes' expression and on their average noise (variance). Thus, rather than focusing on specific genes, ensemble gene noise allows for the holistic identification and interpretation of gene expression disbalance on the level of gene networks and systems. Comparing H1N1, CAP and sepsis patients we spotted common disturbances in a number of pathways/protein complexes relevant to the sepsis pathology which lead to an increase in the ensemble gene noise. Among others, these include mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and peroxisomes which could be readily targeted for adjuvant treatment by methylene blue and 4 phenylbutyrate respectively. Finally, we showed that ensemble gene noise could be successfully applied for the prediction of clinical outcome, namely mortality, of CAP and sepsis patients. Thus, we conclude that ensemble gene noise represents a promising approach for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of a pathology through a prism of alterations in coherent expression of gene circuits.	0
1676	Transmission of the SAR COV 2 virus that causes COVID 19 is largely driven by human behavior and person to person contact. By staying home, people reduce the probability of contacting an infectious individual, becoming infected, and passing on the virus. One of the most promising sources of data on time use is smartphone location data. We develop a time use driven proportional mixing SEIR model that naturally incorporates time spent at home measured using smartphone location data and allows people of different health statuses to behave differently. We simulate epidemics in almost every county in the United States. The model suggests that Americans' behavioral shifts have reduced cases in 55% 86% of counties and for 71% 91% of the population, depending on modeling assumptions. Resuming pre epidemic behavior would lead to a rapid rise in cases in most counties. Spatial patterns of bending and flattening the curve are robust to modeling assumptions. Depending on epidemic history, county demographics, and behavior within a county, returning those with acquired immunity (assuming it exists) to regular schedules generally helps reduce cumulative COVID 19 cases. The model robustly identifies which counties would experience the greatest share of case reduction relative to continued distancing behavior. The model occasionally mischaracterizes epidemic patterns in counties tightly connected to larger counties that are experiencing large epidemics. Understanding these patterns is critical for prioritizing testing resources and back to work planning for the United States.	0

1681	"In the current COVID 19 crisis, the US and many countries in the world are suffering acute shortages of modern ventilators to care for desperately ill patients. Since modern ICU ventilators are powerful devices that can deliver very high gas flow rates and pressures, multiple physicians have attempted to ventilate more than one patient on a single ventilatorso called ""vent splitting"". Early applications of this approach have utilized simple concatenations of ventilator tubing and T pieces, to provide flow to more than one patient. Additional approaches using custom flow splitters  sometimes made using 3D printing technologies  have also advanced into the clinic with FDA approval. However, heretofore there has been less progress made on controlling individual ventilatory pressures for patients with severe lung disease. Given the inherent variability and instability of lung compliance amongst patients with COVID 19, there remains an important need to provide a means of extending ventilator usefulness to more than one patient, but in a way that provides more tailored pressures that can be titrated over time. In this descriptive report, we provide the basis for a ventilator circuit that can support two patients with individualized peak inspiratory and end expiratory pressures. The circuit is comprised of exclusively ""off the shelf"" materials and is inexpensive to produce. The circuit can be used with typical ICU ventilators, and with anesthesia ventilators used in operating rooms. Inspiratory and end expiratory pressures for each patient can be titrated over time, without changes for one patient affecting the ventilation parameters of the other patient. Using in line spirometry, individual tidal volumes can be measured for each patient. This Pressure Regulated Ventilator Splitting (PReVentS) Yale University protocol operates under a pressure control ventilatory mode, and may function optimally when patients are not triggering breaths from the ventilator. This method has been tested thus far only in the laboratory with mock lungs, and has not yet been deployed in animals or in patients. However, given the novelty and potential utility of this approach, we deemed it appropriate to provide this information to the broader critical care community at the present time. In coming days and weeks, we will continue to characterize and refine this approach, using large animal models and proof of principle human studies."	0

Our objective is to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS CoV 2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population. In this case series of 752 patients, the full spectrum of cases is described. Fever was present in 86 90% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (49.1 51.0%), fatigue (25.2 27.1%), sputum (20.0 23.1%), and headache (9.8 11.1%). the mortality rate is 4.6% in Wuhan, 1.9% in Beijing, and 0.9% in Shanghai. Our findings showed that the levels of lymphocytes were 0.8 (IQR, 0.6 1.1) 10 9 /L in Wuhan, 1.0 (IQR, 0.7 1.4) 10 9 /L in Beijing, and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8 1.5) 10 9 /L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals, respectively, indicating that cellular immune function might relate to the mortality. Based on the reference ranges of normal Chinese Han population and the data of the critically ill patients we have observed, it is recommended that reference ranges of people at high risk of COVID 19 infection are CD3   lymphocytes below 900 cells/mm 3 , CD4   lymphocytes below 500 cells/mm 3 , and CD8   lymphocytes below 300 cells/mm 3 .

1685	The COVID 19 pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health and well being of the global population. A critical step in the fight against COVID 19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiological imaging using chest radiography. It was found in early studies that patients present abnormalities in chest radiography images that are characteristic of those infected with COVID 19. Motivated by this, a number of artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on deep learning have been proposed and results have been shown to be quite promising in terms of accuracy in detecting patients infected with COVID 19 using chest radiography images. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, these developed AI systems have been closed source and unavailable to the research community for deeper understanding and extension, and unavailable for public access and use. Therefore, in this study we introduce COVID Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the detection of COVID 19 cases from chest X ray (CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. We also describe the CXR dataset leveraged to train COVID Net, which we will refer to as COVIDx and is comprised of 13,800 chest radiography images across 13,725 patient patient cases from three open access data repositories, one of which we introduced. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening. By no means a production ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID Net, along with the description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID 19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who need it the most. arXiv:2003.09871v3 [eess.IV] 15 Apr 2020	0

1687	"We have analyzed the cell type specific expression of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) components across 141 cell types or subtypes as defined by single cell RNA seq (scRNAseq) analysis. ACE2, one of the components of RAS, also facilitates SARS CoV 2 entry into cells in cooperation with its associated protease TMPRSS2. Therefore, our analysis also contributes to the understanding of SARS CoV 2 infection, spreading of the virus throughout the body, and potential viral interference with RAS in COVID 19 patients.
The COVID 19 pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has created a global health emergency with more than a million confirmed cases as of April 4, 2020 1 . For cellular entry, SARS CoV 2 relies on the interaction of its glycosylated viral spike (S) protein with the host membrane bound aminopeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Subsequently, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves S and/or ACE2 protein, which facilitates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes 2 . ACE2 is also a crucial component of RAS, which regulates several key physiological processes such as blood pressure and electrolyte balance and viral infection of ACE2 expressing cells may impair RAS function 3 .
The secreted and systemically distributed protease renin (REN) activates RAS by proteolytically cleaving plasma angiotensinogen (AGT) to produce the 10 amino acid (aa) hormonal peptide, angiotensin I (Ang I). Subsequently, Ang I is processed to the 8 aa Ang II by the metallopeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) present on the surface of pulmonary and kidney endothelial cells.

1689	"Here, Cas13a has been used to target and mitigate influenza virus A (IAV) and SARS CoV 2 using a synthetic mRNA based platform. CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) against PB1 and highly conserved regions of PB2 were screened in conjunction with mRNA encoded Cas13a. Screens were designed such that only guides that decreased influenza RNA levels in a Cas13 mediated fashion, were valid. Cas13a mRNA and validated guides, delivered post infection, simulating treatment, were tested in combination and across multiplicities of infection. Their function was also characterized over time. Similar screens were performed for guides against SARS CoV 2, yielding multiple guides that significantly impacted cytopathic effect. Last, the approach was utilized in vivo, demonstrating the ability to degrade influenza RNA in a mouse model of infection, using polymer formulated, nebulizer based mRNA delivery.
Our findings demonstrate the applicability of Cas13a in mitigating respiratory infections both in vitro and in a mouse model, paving the way for future therapeutic use."	1

1694	"Since the outbreak of COVID 19, there has been a pressing need for development of a prognostic tool that is easy for clinicians to use. Recently, a Lancet publication showed that in a cohort of 191 patients with COVID 19, age, SOFA score and D dimer measurements were associated with mortality. No other publication involving prognostic factors or models has been identified to date.
In our cohorts of 444 patients from two hospitals, SOFA scores were low in the majority of patients on admission. The relevance of D dimer could not be verified, as it is not included in routine laboratory tests. In this study, we have established a multivariable clinical prediction model using a development cohort of 299 patients from one hospital. After backwards selection, four variables, including age, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase and SpO2 remained in the model to predict mortality. This has been validated internally and externally with a cohort of 145 patients from a different hospital. Discrimination of the model was excellent in both internal (c=0·89) and external (c=0·98) validation. Calibration plots showed excellent agreement between predicted and observed probabilities of mortality after recalibration of the model to account for underlying differences in the risk profile of the datasets.

1695	"We argue that frequent sampling of the fraction of infected people (either by random testing or by analysis of sewage water), is central to managing the COVID 19 pandemic because it both measures in real time the key variable controlled by restrictive measures, and anticipates the load on the healthcare system due to progression of the disease. Knowledge of random testing outcomes will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates.
Here we suggest, irrespective of the size of a suitably homogeneous population, a conservative estimate of 15'000 for the number of randomly tested people per day which will suffice to obtain reliable data about the current fraction of infections and its evolution in time, thus enabling close to real time assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. Still higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences in spreading rates. Furthermore and most importantly, with daily sampling in place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a relaxation of restrictions with testing focused on symptomatic individuals. This is demonstrated by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where the feed back is derived from noisy sampling data. * Markus.Mueller@psi.ch 1 As of early April 2020, according to the liveticker of the Swiss radio and television https://www.srf.ch/."	0

To date, thousands of cases of COVID 19 have been reported in England, and over 18,000 patients have died. While there has been progress in managing this disease, it is not clear which factors, in addition to age, affect the severity and mortality of COVID 19. A recent analysis of COVID 19 in Italy identified links between air pollution and death rates. Here, we explored potential links between three major air pollutants related to fossil fuels and SARS CoV 2 mortality in England. We compared current, SARS CoV 2 cases and deaths recorded in public databases to region level air pollution data monitored at over 120 sites across England. We found that the levels of some markers of poor air quality, nitrogen oxides and ozone, were associated with COVID 19 mortality in different English regions, after adjusting for population density. We conclude that the levels of some air pollutants are linked to COVID 19 cases and morbidity. We consider that our study provides a pandemic.	0

It is possible that the common market exposure indicated animal to human transmission was potentially the result of observer bias. To support the hypothesis of zoonotic origin of 2019 nCoV stemming from the Huanan seafood market, the index case should have had exposure history related to the market and the virus should have been identified from animals sold at the market. As these requirements remain unmet, zoonotic spillover at the market must not be overemphasized.	1

1704	I employ a simple mathematical model of an epidemic process to evaluate how three basic quantities: the reproduction number (ℛ), the number of infectious individuals (I), and total community size (N) affect strategies to control COVID 19. Numerical simulations show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low numbers of infections that are conducive to subsequent management. Our results on short term strategies point to either a two step control strategy, following failed mitigation, that begins with suppression of the reproduction number, ℛC, below 1.0, followed by renewed mitigation measures that manage the epidemic by maintaining ℛC at approximately 1.0, or should suppression not be feasible, the progressive lowering of ℛC below 1.0. The full sequence of measures that we are observing in a number of countries, and likely to see in the longer term, can be symbolically represented as: ℛ0 à ℛC<ℛ0 à ℛC<<1.0 à ℛC≈1.0 à ℛC<1.0.

Longer observation period and more than 2 series of negative viral test are necessary for patients ≥65 years. This study is currently the largest case series to date on the RT PCR findings of COVID 19 throughout disease course. Abstract Background: With the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) infection, its effect on society is amplified. We aimed to describe the viral detection results across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods: A retrospective study of 301 confirmed COVID 19 patients hospitalized at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, were included. Demographic characteristics of the patients were collected. Upper respiratory specimens (throat and/or nasal swabs) were obtained and analyzed by real time RT PCR for SARS CoV 2 infection. Period of viral infection and the contagious stage were analyzed. Results: Of 301 hospitalized COVID 19 patients, the median age was 58 years and 51.2% were male. The median period between symptoms presence and positive SARS CoV 2 RT PCR results was 16 days (IQR, 10 23, N=301). The median period between symptoms presence and an effective negative SARS CoV 2 RT PCR result was 20 days (IQR, 17 24; N=216). Infected patient ≥65 years old stayed contagious longer (22 days vs 19 days, J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f p=0.015). Although two consecutive negative results were confirmed in 70 patients, 30%
of them had positive viral test results for the third time. Using specimens from nasal swabs to run the RT PCR test showed a higher positive rate than using specimens from throat swabs.
Conclusions: This large scale investigation with 1113 RT PCR test results from 301 COVID 19 patients showed that the average contagious period of SARS CoV 2 infected patients was 20 days. Longer observation period and more than 2 series of negative viral test are necessary for patients ≥65 years."	0
1707	"China reported during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models widely used in the literature. We highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over fitting and under fitting, as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike information criterion, root mean square errors and robustness index to quantify these three golden means and to evaluate various epidemic models/methods.
Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role in forecasting. Before the inflection point, no model considered here could make a reliable prediction. We further notice the Logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function makes an overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time dependent reproduction number take the non constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Towards the dynamical models based on ODEs, it is observed that the SEIR QD and SEIR PO models generally show a better performance than SIR, SEIR and SEIR AHQ models on the COVID 19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the inclusion of selfprotection and quarantine, and a proper trade off between model complexity and fitting accuracy."	0

1713	Background: As of March 2, 2020, SARS CoV 2 has infected more than 80174 people and caused 2915 deaths in China. This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS CoV 2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID 19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT PCR) to detect SARS CoV 2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID 19 was 37 88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS CoV 2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID 19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS CoV 2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS CoV 2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42·9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID 19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS CoV 2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS CoV 2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.	0

1715	"After the spread of SARS CoV 2 epidemic out of China, the world approaches the 2 million declared infected cases and death toll rises well above the 100 thousand. The course of pandemic evolution has shown great differences among countries and not much is yet known about the level of generated immunity, which might appear not to be long lasting. In this situation, management of a recurrent disease seems to be a plausible scenario that countries worldwide will have to face, before effective drugs or a vaccine appear. Spain in Europe, appears to be the first country deciding to partly lift the strict social distancing regulations imposed. Whether this action may lead to further epidemic recrudescence, to a following second wave of cases or conversely, help return to previous normality, is a subject of great debate and interest to all other countries affected by COVID 19. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we had also incorporated effects of social confinement. We now modify this previous model configuration to mimic potential post confinement scenarios, by simulating from instant massive liberation of different portions of the confined population, up to a more gradual incorporation of people to work. Results show how current lockdown conditions should be extended at least two weeks more to prevent a new escalation in cases and deaths, as well as a larger second wave occurring in just a few months. Conversely, best case scenario in terms of lower COVID 19 incidence and casualties should gradually incorporate workers back in a daily proportion at most 30 percent higher than that of previous confinement. The former should begin not earlier than by the end of April and it would represent approximately 600 thousand people or a 3.75% rate for the whole of Spain.

1716	Motivation: Infectious diseases from novel viruses are becoming a major public health concern. Fast identification methods for novel viruses are based only on protein sequences. Yet, it is not clear to what extent other important features, such as the symptoms caused by the viruses, could contribute to a predictor. Disease phenotypes (i.e., symptoms) are readily accessible from clinical diagnosis and we hypothesize that they may act as a potential proxy and an additional source of information for the underlying molecular interactions between the pathogens and hosts. Results: We developed DeepViral, a deep learning method that predicts potential protein protein interactions between human and viruses. First, human proteins and viruses were embedded in a shared space using their associated phenotypes, functions, taxonomic classification, as well as formalized background knowledge from biomedical ontologies. By extending a sequence learning model with phenotype features, our model can not only significantly improve over previous sequence based approaches for inter species interaction prediction, but also identify pathways of viral targets under a realistic experimental setup for novel viruses.

Tools that facilitate the in silico prediction of immune response to biothreats, emerging infectious diseases, and cancers can accelerate the design of novel and next generation vaccines and their delivery to the clinic. Over the past 20 years, vaccinologists, bioinformatics experts, and advanced programmers based in Providence, Rhode Island, USA have advanced the development of an integrated toolkit for vaccine design called iVAX, that is secure and user accessible by internet. This integrated set of immunoinformatic tools comprises algorithms for scoring and triaging candidate antigens, selecting immunogenic and conserved T cell epitopes, re engineering or eliminating regulatory T cell epitopes, and re designing antigens to induce immunogenicity and protection against disease for humans and livestock. Commercial and academic applications of iVAX have included identifying immunogenic T cell epitopes in the development of a T cell based human multi epitope Q fever vaccine, designing novel influenza vaccines, identifying cross conserved T cell epitopes for a malaria vaccine, and analyzing immune responses in clinical vaccine studies. Animal vaccine applications to date have included viral infections of pigs such as swine influenza A, PCV2, and African Swine Fever.

1731	"Hospitals in Italy during this pandemic seem overwhelmed, leaving physicians with little guidance on how to triage patients and allocate therapeutic resources.1 Based on current rates of critical care admission in China and Italy, in a worst case scenario, Canada would have a deficit of thousands of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the peak of a national epidemic—a problem that will disproportionately affect older adults. We speculate that the decision was based on an observation that patients presenting with comorbidities, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and immunocompromising conditions, have higher COVID 19 mortality.2 However, the correlation between polymorbidity and age is far from perfect, due to the heterogeneity of aging.3
As this pandemic develops, emergency physicians must be familiar with a more global approach to the assessment of patients’ physiologic resilience and chance of benefit with intensive care."	0

1736	"To examine the impact of providing healthcare during or after health emergencies caused by viral epidemic outbreaks on healthcare workers´(HCWs) mental health, and to assess the available evidence base regarding interventions to reduce such impact.
Design: Systematic rapid review and meta analysis.
Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, searched up to 23 March 2020.
We selected observational and experimental studies examining the impact on mental health of epidemic outbreaks on HCWs. One reviewer screened titles and abstracts, and two reviewers independently reviewed full texts. We extracted study characteristics, symptoms, prevalence of mental health problems, risk factors, mental health interventions, and its impact. We assessed risk of bias for each individual study and used GRADE to ascertain the certainty of the evidence. We conducted a narrative and tabulated synthesis of the results. We pooled data using random effects meta analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems.
We included 61 studies (56 examining impact on mental health and five about interventions to reduce such impact). Most were conducted in Asia (59%), in the hospital setting (79%), and examined the impact of the SARS epidemic (69%). The pooled prevalence was higher for anxiety (45%, 95% CI 21 to 69%; 6 studies, 3,373 participants), followed by depression (38%, 95% CI 15 to 60%; 7 studies, 3,636 participants), acute stress disorder (31%, 95% CI 0 to 82%, 3 studies , 2,587 participants), burnout (29%, 95% CI 25 to 32%; 3 studies; 1,168 participants), and post traumatic stress disorder (19%, 95% CI 11 to 26%, 10 studies, 3,121 participants). Based on 37 studies, we identified factors associated with the likelihood of developing those problems, including sociodemographic (younger age and female gender), social (lack of social support, social rejection or isolation, stigmatization), and occupational (working in a high risk environment (frontline staff), specific occupational roles (e.g., nurse), and lower levels of specialised training, preparedness and job experience) factors. Five studies reported interventions for frontline HCW, two of which were educational and aimed to prevent mental health problems by increasing HCWs´ resilience. These interventions increased confidence in support and training, pandemic self efficacy, and interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty). One multifaceted intervention implemented training and organisational changes) targeted at hospital nurses during the SARS epidemic, reporting improvements in .

1737	This paper introduces a dynamic panel SIR (DP SIR) model to investigate the impact of non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the COVID 19 transmission dynamics with panel data from 9 countries across the globe. By constructing scenarios with different combinations of NPIs, our empirical findings suggest that countries may avoid the lockdown the U.S. and Singapore may require additional measures of NPIs in order to control disease transmissions more effectively, while other countries may cautiously consider to gradually lift some NPIs to mitigate the costs to the overall economy.	1
1738	"We compared clinical, laboratory, radiological, and outcome features of patients with SARS CoV 2 infection with pneumonia, with vs without diarrhea.
We performed a retrospective, single center analysis of 84 patients with SARS CoV 2 pneumonia in Wuhan Union Hospital, China, from January 19 through February 7, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real time reverse transcriptase PCR of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens for SARS CoV 2 RNA. Blood samples were analyzed for white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, D dimer, C reactive protein, and in some cases, immunoglobulins, complement, lymphocyte subsets, and cytokines. Virus RNA was detected in stool samples by real time PCR.
Of the 84 patients with SARS CoV 2 pneumonia, 26 (31%) had diarrhea.
The duration of fever and dyspnea in patients with diarrhea was significantly longer than those without diarrhea (all P<.05). Stool samples from a higher proportion of patients with diarrhea tested positive for virus RNA (69%) than from patients without diarrhea (17%) (P<.001). As of February 19, a lower proportion of patients with diarrhea had a negative result from the latest throat swab for SARS CoV 2 (77%) than patients without diarrhea (97%) (P=.010), during these patients' hospitalization. Of 76 patients with a negative result from their latest throat swab test during hospitalization, a significantly higher proportion of patients with diarrhea had a positive result from the retest for SARS CoV 2 in stool (45%) than patients without diarrhea (20%) (P=.039).
: At a single center in Wuhan, China, 31% of patients with SARS CoV 2 pneumonia had diarrhea. A significantly higher proportion of patients with diarrhea have virus RNA in stool than patients without diarrhea. Elimination of SARS CoV 2 from stool takes longer than elimination from the nose and throat. Need to Know Background: Studies are needed to compare the clinical, laboratory, and outcome features of patients with SARS CoV 2 infection (COVID 19) with pneumonia, with vs without diarrhea. Findings: At a single center in Wuhan, China, 31% of patients with SARS CoV 2 pneumonia had diarrhea. A significantly higher proportion of patients with diarrhea have virus RNA in stool than patients without diarrhea.
Implications for patient care: Elimination of SARS CoV 2 from stool takes longer than elimination from the nose and throat."	0

1740	Genome Detective is a web based, user friendly software application to quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation sequencing datasets. This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS related coronavirus (SARSr CoV) and all of the available public data for SARS CoV 2. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to stop the COVID 19 disease.	1

1748	"The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2, has an estimated overall case fatality ratio of 1.38% in China, being 53% higher in males and increasing exponentially with age. Mosaicism for X chromosome monosomy (XCM) shows a similar increase in aging population mostly driven by loss of chromosome Y in males (LOY), and is associated with a raise in all cause mortality. Using comparative transcriptomic data, we have defined that XCM/LOY is associated with abnormal peripheral blood cell counts with decreased progenitor cells and multiple biomarkers of immune system dysfunction, pro coagulation activity and increased cardiovascular risk. Several differentially down regulated genes in XCM/LOY individuals are involved in the initial immune response to SARS CoV 2 (OR of enrichment=7.23, p=1.5x10  7 ), mainly interferon induced genes that code for inhibitors of viral processes. Thus, our data suggest that XCM mosaicism underlies at least part of the sex biased severity and mortality of COVID 19 in aging patients.
Given its potential relevance for modulating prognosis and therapeutic response, we propose that evaluation of LOY and XCM by currently established methods should be implemented as biomarkers in infected patients, including currently ongoing clinical trials with different medications and vaccines for COVID 19. Testing for LOY/XCM at large scale among elderly people may also be helpful to identify still unexposed people who may be especially vulnerable to severe Covid 19 disease."	1

1750	One of the challenges in the current COVID 19 crisis is the time and cost of performing tests especially for large scale population surveillance. Since, the probability of testing positive in large population studies is expected to be small (<15%), therefore, most of the test outcomes will be negative. Here, we propose the use of agglomerative sampling which can prune out multiple negative cases in a single test by intelligently combining samples from different individuals. The proposed scheme builds on the assumption that samples from the population may not be independent of each other. Our simulation results show that the proposed sampling strategy can significantly increase testing capacity under resource constraints: on average, a saving of ~40% tests can be expected assuming a positive test probability of 10% across the given samples. The proposed scheme can also be used in conjunction with heuristic or Machine Learning guided clustering for improving the efficiency of large scale testing further. The code for generating the simulation results for this work is available here: https://github.com/foxtrotmike/AS.	0
1751	" Refugees faced several challenges due to their condition. With the COVID 19 pandemic, Refugees encounter several difficulties: adapting to the language while trying to obtain reliable information; the unhealthy spaces in which they live, overcrowded, without access to water, basic sanitation, food are also factors that aggravate their condition. Lack of human resources due to quarantine and the lack of infrastructure of support agencies in countries that have received refugees also mitigates assistance.  All of these factors associated with fear and uncertainties about the future are consistent risk factors for an increase in cases of COVID 19 infection as well as psychiatric illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and post traumatic stress disorder.
Abstract Background: 68.5 million people around the world have been forced to leave their houses. Refugees have mainly to face their adaption in a host country, which involves bureaucracy, different culture, poverty, and racism. The already fragile situation of refugees becomes worrying and challenged in the face of the new coronavirus (COVID 19) epidemic. Therefore, we aimed to describe the factors that can worsen the mental health of refugees.
The studies were identified in well known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. The data were cross checked with information from the main international newspapers.
Results: According to the literature, the difficulties faced by refugees with the COVID 19 pandemic are potentiated by the pandemic state. There are several risk factors common to coronavirus and psychiatric illnesses as overcrowding, disruption of sewage disposal, poor standards of hygiene, poor nutrition, negligible sanitation, lack of access to shelter, health care, public services, and safety. These associated with fear and uncertainty create a closed ground for psychological sickness and COVID 19 infection.
Conclusions: There should be not only a social mobilization to contain the virus, but also a collective effort on behalf of the most vulnerable populations."	0
1752	Background: The current 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is rapidly evolving. YouTube has been recognized as a popular source of information in previous disease outbreaks. We analyzed the content on YouTube about n CoV in English and Mandarin languages. Methods: YouTube was searched using the terms '2019 novel coronavirus', 'Wuhan virus' and '武汉病毒' (Mandarin for Wuhan virus) on 1st and 2nd February 2020. First 50 videos in each group were analyzed. Videos in other languages, duplicate videos, those without an audio and duration > 15 min were excluded .72 videos in English and 42 in Mandarin were reviewed. 2 reviewers classified the videos as useful, misleading or news based on pre specified criterion. Inter observer agreement was evaluated with kappa coefficient. Modified DISCERN index for reliability and medical information and content index (MICI) score were used for content analysis. Results: These videos attracted cumulative 21,288,856 views. 67% of English and 50% Mandarin videos had useful information. The viewership of misleading Mandarin videos was higher than the useful ones. WHO accounted for only 4% of useful videos. Mean DISCERN score for reliability was 3.12/5 and 3.25/5 for English and Mandarin videos respectively. Mean cumulative MICI score of useful videos was low (6.71/25 for English and 6.28/25 for Mandarin).	0
1753	"AIM: To report the epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics of patients with COVID 19 in Xiaogan, Hubei, China.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The complete clinical and imaging data of 114 confirmed COVID 19 patients treated in Xiaogan Hospital were analysed retrospectively. Data were gathered regarding the presence of chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities; the distribution, morphology, density, location, and stage of abnormal shadows on chest CT; and observing the correlation between the severity of chest infection and lymphocyte ratio and blood oxygen saturation (SPO 2 ) in patients.
RESULTS: Chest CT revealed abnormal lung shadows in 110 patients. Regarding lesion distribution, multi lobe lesions in both lungs were present in most patients (80 cases; 72.7%). Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central zone (62 cases; 56.4%). Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas. Thirty cases showed ground glass opacity (27.3%), 30 cases showed the consolidation change (27.3%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4%). The progressing stage was the most common stage (54 cases; 49.1%). CT results showed a negative correlation with SPO 2 and lymphocyte numbers (p<0.05), with rvalues of À0.446 and À0.780, respectively. CONCLUSION: Spiral CT is a sensitive examination method, which can be applied to make an early diagnosis and for evaluation of progression, with a diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy better than that of nucleic acid detection."	0

1755	"As reported by Iranian governments, the first cases of coronavirus infections confirmed in Qom, Iran on February 19, 2020 (30 Bahman 1398). The number of identified cases afterward increased rapidly and the novel coronavirus spread to all provinces of the country. This study aimed to fit an epidemic model to the reported cases data to estimate the basic reproduction number (ܴ ) of COVID 19 in Iran.
We used data from February 21, 2020, to April 21, 2020, on the number of cases reported by Iranian governments and we employed the SIR (Susceptible Infectious Removed) epidemic spreading model to fit the transmission model to the reported cases data by tuning the parameters in order to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID 19 in Iran.
The value of reproduction number was estimated 4.86 in the first week and 4.5 in the second week. it decreased from 4.29 to 2.37 in the next four weeks. At the seventh week of the outbreak the reproduction number was reduced below one.
The results indicate that the basic reproduction number of COVID 19 was significantly larger than one in the early stages of the outbreak. However, implementing social distancing and preventing travelling on Nowruz (Persian New Year) effectively reduced the reproduction number. Although the results indicate that reproduction number is below one, it is necessary to continue social outbreak."	0
1756	"The new coronavirus known as COVID 19 is rapidly spreading since December 2019. Without any vaccination it are limited to quarantine and social distancing.
Here we study the spatio temporal propagation of the COVID 19 virus in China and compare it to other global locations. Our results suggest that the disease propagation is highly related to population migration from Hubei resembling a Lévy flight which is characteristic of human mobility. Our results also suggest that the disease spread in a city in China is characterized by two stages process. At early times, at order of few days, the infection rate in the city is almost constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection signs are observed and at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to quarantines. These two stages can explain the significant differences between the propagation in China and in other world wide locations. While most Chinese cities control the disease which resulted in the decaying stage, in other world wide countries the situation is still becoming worse probably due to less control. arXiv:2003.08382v1 [physics.soc ph] "	1

1760	Methods: 234 inpatients with COVID 19 were included. Detailed clinical data, chest HRCT basic performances and certain signs were recorded Ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping were quantified. Both clinical types and CT stages were evaluated. Results: Most patients (approximately 90%) were classified as common type and with epidemiologic history. Fever and cough were main symptoms. Chest CT showed abnormal attenuation in bilateral multiple lung lobes, distributed in the lower and/or periphery of the lungs (94.98%), with multiple shapes. GGO and vascular enhancement sign were most frequent seen, followed by interlobular septal thickening and air bronchus sign as well as consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping. There were significant differences in most of CT signs between different stage groups. The SpO2 and OI were decreased in stage IV, and the CT score of consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping was significantly lower in stage I (P < 0.05). A weak relevance was between the fibrosis score and the value of PaO2 and SpO2 (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Clinical performances of patients with COVID 19, mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms, were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the COVID 19. While chest HRCT provided the distribution, shape, attenuation and extent of lung lesions, as well as some typical CT signs of COVID 19 pneumonia.	0

Within 3 months, the World Health Organization defined COVID 19 as a pandemic, with more than 370,000 cases and 16,000 deaths worldwide. In consideration of the crucial role of diagnostic testing during COVID 19, the aim of this technical note was to provide a complete synthesis of approaches implemented for the management of suspected or confirmed COVID 19 patients.
The planning of a robust plan to prevent the transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members should be fundamental in each radiology service. Moreover, the speed of spread and the incidence of the pandemic make it necessary to optimize the use of personal protective devices and dedicated COVID 19 equipment, given the limited availability of supplies."	1
1763	"Virological tests have now shown conclusively that a novel coronavirus is causing the 2019 2020 atypical pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China. We demonstrate that non virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing. Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of eleven pathogens that have previously caused cases of atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to ""Disease X"" (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued. The probability (expressed as a percentage) that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 29% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 January 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 49%. We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen. The proposed approach, which uses only routinely observed non virological data, can aid ongoing risk assessments in advance of virological test results becoming available."	0

1765	"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID 19 pandemic, alternative methods of care are needed to reduce the relative risk of transmission in departments. Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments. We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in person treatment coverage practice.
METHODS: All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions. The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage. Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the RO's shared screen. Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment.
RESULTS: Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment. Average times of pre treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively. The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO's shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s. The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in person RO coverage comfort levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures. This may help to reduce transmission of COVID 19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs support."	0

1770	The spread of the COVID 19 caused by the SARS CoV 2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in December 2019. The publishing of the first SARS CoV 2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating : bioRxiv preprint 2 the binding energy between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS CoV 2 to the current virus responsible for COVID 19 outbreak. Our result was consistent with the phylogeny analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS CoV 2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS CoV 2 RBD for binding to hACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of human engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS CoV 2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS CoV 2.	0

1772	"Background. Mobile phones have become an integral part of modern society. As possible breeding grounds for microbial organisms, these constitute a potential global public health risk for microbial transmission.
Scoping review of literature examining microbial's presence on mobile phones in both health care (HC) and community settings.
A search (PubMed&GoogleScholar) was conducted from January 2005 December 2019 to identify English language studies. Studies were included if samples from mobile phones were tested for bacteria, fungi, and/or viruses; and if the sampling was carried out in any HC setting, and/or within the general community. Any other studies exploring mobile phones that did not identify specific microorganisms were excluded.
A total of 56 studies were included (from 24 countries). Most studies identified the presence of bacteria (54/56), while 16 studies reported the presence of fungi. One study focused solely on RNA viruses. Staphylococcus aureus, and Coagulase Negative Staphylococci were the most numerous identified organisms present on mobile phones. These two species and Escherichia coli were present in over a third of studies both in HC and community samples. Methicillin resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter sp., and Bacillus sp. were present in over a third of the studies in HC settings.
While this scoping review of literature regarding microbial identification on mobile phones in HC and community settings did not directly address the issue of SARS CoV 2 responsible for COVID 19, this work exposes the possible role of mobile phones as a 'Trojan horse' contributing to the transmission of microbial infections in epidemics and pandemics."	0

Background: Aminopeptidases activate bradykinin and degrade many inflammatory peptides. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the types of aminopeptidase activities in human nasal mucosa. Methods: Human nasal mucosa was homogenized (n = 12), and cytoplasmic (S2) and membrane rich (P2) fractions were obtained. Several aminopeptidase (Ap) activities were defined by (1) substrate specificity with leucine enkephalin (leu Ap) and alanine nitroanilide (ala Ap), (2) inhibitor studies with puromycin and bestatin, (3) enzyme activity histochemistry (zymography), (4) immunohistochemistry, and (5) gel electrophoresis. Human volunteers had methacholine, histamine, and allergen nasal provocations to determine the mechanisms controlling nasal aminopeptidase secretion in vivo.
IgG detected immunoreactive material in epithelium, glands, and endothelium. In nasal provocation studies, leu AP correlated with glandular exocytosis but not vascular leak. Conclusions: The predominant aminopeptidase in human nasal epithelial and submucosal gland cells was membranebound puromycin resistant aminopeptidase. A novel soluble puromycin resistant aminopeptidase and lower amounts of soluble PS Ap were also detected. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 1998;102:741 50.)"	0

1777	"Lacking a drug or vaccine, our current strategy to contain the COVID 19 pandemic is by means of social distancing, specifically mobility restrictions and lock downs. Such measures impose a hurtful toll on the economy, and are difficult to sustain for extended periods. The challenge is that selective isolation of the sick, an often viable and effective strategy, is insufficient against COVID 19, due to its relatively long incubation period, in which exposed individuals experience no symptoms, but still contribute to the spread. Here we propose an alternating lock down strategy, in which at every instance, half of the population remains under lock down while the other half continues to be active, maintaining a routine of weekly succession between activity and lock down. All symptomatic individuals continue to remain in isolation. Under this regime, if an individual was exposed during their active week, by the time they complete their lock down they will already begin to exhibit symptoms. Hence this strategy isolates the majority of exposed individuals during their asymptomatic phase. We find that this strategy not only overcomes the pandemic, but also allows for some level of flexibility, withstanding a fraction of defectors or essential workers that remain continuously active. We examine our strategy based on current epidemiological models with parameters relevant for COVID 19. We wish, however, following this communication, to further test and fine tune our scheme based more refined data, and assess its actual effectiveness.
Note from the authors. In light of the imminence of the matter, we have decided to publish this report, even in its preliminary form, forgoing the scientific instinct of scrutiny and reservedness. We will continue to refine and retest our results and update this report on the go. We also welcome feedback, comments, questions or advice that can help further test or improve our proposed strategy.
As we battle the virulent spread of COVID 19 we seek efficient strategies to mitigate its global impact. Lacking therapeutic interventions, such as drugs or vaccines, we resort to social distancing, aimed primarily at lowering the reproduction rate R 0 and flattening the curve, i.e. reducing the total number of infected individuals, while spreading their infection over an extended period [1 3]. Such measures are designed to avoid shocking the health care system, reducing the medical burden, and slowing its onset, hence keeping it within the bounds of the system's capacity. To achieve this many countries have imposed social restrictions [3], from complete lock downs, to severe mobility constraints, indeed, slowing down the viral propagation, but at the same time, taking a sever toll on social and economic stability. Most current projections on COVID 19 indicate that such social distancing policies must be put in place for extended periods (typically months) to avoid reemergence of the epidemic once lifted [4] . This, however, may be unsustainable, as individual social and economic needs will, at some point surpass the perceived risk of the pandemic.
Another challenge, specific to COVID 19, is its incubation period, estimated at ∼ 5 days on average"	0
1778	"The novel coronavirus COVID 19 follows transmission route and clinical presentation of all community acquired coronaviruses. Instead, the rate of transmission is significative higher, with a faster spread of the virus responsible of the worldwide outbreak and a significative higher mortality rate due to the development of a severe lung injury. Most noteworthy is the distribution of death rate among age groups. Children and younger people are almost protected from severe clinical presentation.
Possible explanation of this phenomenon could be the ability of past vaccinations (especially tetanic, diphtheria toxoids and inactivated bacteria as pertussis) to stimulate immune system and to generate a scattered immunity against non self antigens in transit, as coronaviruses and other communitycirculating viruses and make immune system readier to develop specific immunity against COVID 19.
The first support to this hypothesis is the distribution of mortality rate during historical pandemics (""Spanish flu"" 1918, ""Asian flu"" 1956 and ""the Hong Kong flu"" 1968) among age groups before and after the introduction of vaccines.
The immunological support to the hypothesis derives from recent studies about immunotherapy for malignancies, which propose the use of oncolytic vaccines combined with toxoids in order to exploit CD4  memory T cell recall in supporting the ongoing anti tumour response.
According to this hypothesis vaccine formulations (tetanus, diphtheria, Bordetella pertussis) could be re administrate after the first contact with Covid 19, better before the development of respiratory severe illness and of course before full blown ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
The CD4  memory exploiting could help immune system to recall immunity of already know antigens against coronaviruses, avoiding or limiting ""lung crash"" until virus specific immunity develops and making it faster and prolonged.
Finally, this administration could be helpful not only in already infected patients, but also before infection. In fact, people could have an immune system more ready when the contact with the COVID 19 will occur."	0

1782	"Background Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV). Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non pharmaceutical prevention interventions.
Methods We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019 nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23 24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV). A susceptible exposed infectious recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).
In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019 nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47 2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304 130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8 7·1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227 805), 113 (57 193), 98 (49 168), 111 (56 191), and 80 (40 139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019 nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1 2 weeks.
Interpretation Given that 2019 nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally."	0

This qualitative study analyzes the lack of political action to address climate change using a psychiatric lens, and frames that ambivalence lies at the core of inaction.
While most politicians understand that climate action is absolutely necessary, any significant action is stalled by a number of important barriers they have to overcome.
Using clinical analogies from eating disorders and the scientific literature on motivational change, this paper analyses three current strategies that push for political action. First, using force and emotions (like confronting activists) is equivalent to playing a power struggle, which risks increasing politicians' resistance to change. Second, collaborative discussions in multilateral conferences and debates risk feeding verbal manifestos without enacting behavioural change.
Withdrawal from the manifestos of politicians is a third strategy to push for change discussed in this paper. However, even after bypassing manifestos, this strategy is unlikely to succeed because the benefits of greenhouse gas emissions, linked to our current social norms, seriously outweigh the benefits of climate action. Overall, all three methods present severe flaws and are not viable solutions to help politicians implement climate action. Other enhanced options are likely to be necessary."	0

1787	The role of the RNAi/Dicer/Ago system to degrade RNA viruses has been elusive, which prompt authors to think that interferon (IFN) synthesis is essential, relegating the dsRNAs as accessory function. We investigate SARS CoV 2 genome responsible of the new deadly COVID 19 pandemic for the theoretical possibilities to engage intra pairing within the viral RNA and also hybrid pairing with human transcriptome. Segmental pieces of RNAs that originate from SARS CoV 2 were computationally searched as a potential source of one strand, the complementary strand being from the host transcriptome. We therefore considered perfect complementarity of host RNA with any piece of SARS CoV 2 RNA as a collection of theoretical siRNAs potentially Dicer substrates. Few human genes seems targeted by SARS CoV 2 RNA, among them mitochondrial deubiquitinase USP30 and a subunit of ubiquitin protein ligase complex FBXO21 mitochondria.	0

1790	"Background: The United Kingdom is experiencing an increase in drug related deaths and serious bacterial infections among its most vulnerable citizens. Cuts to essential services, coupled with a growing homeless population, create a challenging environment to tackle this public health crisis. In this paper, we highlight an underexplored environmental constraint faced by people living and injecting drugs on the streets. Access to water for injection is restricted in the UK, due to legislative and financial barriers. Austerity measures, such as public toilet closures, further restrict the ability of people made homeless to access clean water and protect themselves from health harms. Methods: We generated questionnaire (n = 455) and in depth qualitative interview (n = 32) data with people who inject drugs in London for the Care and Prevent study. Participants provided detail on their life history; drug use, injecting and living environments; health conditions and care seeking practices. Findings: A high proportion of the survey sample reported lifetime history of street homelessness (78%), bacterial infections (65%) and related hospitalisation (30%). Qualitative accounts highlight unsafe, potentially dangerous, injection practices in semi public spaces. Multiple constraints to sourcing sterile water for injection preparation were reported. Alternatives to sterile water included puddle water, toilet cistern water, whisky, cola soda and saliva. Participants who injected heroin and crack cocaine together unanimously reported adding water at two stages during injection preparation: first, adding water as a vehicle for heroin (which was then heated); second, adding cold water to the heroin mixture prior to adding the crack cocaine. This new finding of a stage addition of solvent may represent an additional risk of infection.
(Continued on next page) Conclusion: Currently, harm reduction equipment and resources for safe injecting are not meeting the needs of people who inject drugs who are street homeless or unstably housed. Preparation of injections with non sterile water sources could precipitate bacterial and fungal infections, particularly when used without the application of heat. It is crucial that water for injection, also skin cleaning, is made available for the unstably housed and that harm reduction messaging is tailored to speak to the everyday realities of people who prepare and inject drugs in public spaces."	0

1797	"Background: , the disease associated with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is currently a global pandemic with several thousands of confirmed cases of infection and death.
However, the death rate across affected countries shows variation deserving of critical evaluation. Methods: In this study, we evaluated differentials in COVID 19 confirmed cases of infection and associated deaths of selected countries in Sub Sahara Africa (Nigeria and Ghana), South Africa, Europe (Italy, Spain, Sweden and UK) and USA. Data acquired for various standard databases on mutational shift of the SARS CoV 2 virus based on geographical location, BCG vaccination policy, malaria endemicity, climatic conditions (temperature), differential healthcare approaches were evaluated over a period of 45 days from the date of reporting the index case. Results: The number of confirmed cases of infection and associated deaths in Sub Sahara Africa were found to be very low compared to the very high values in Europe and USA over the same period. Recovery rate from COVID 19 is not correlated with the mutational attributes of the virus with the sequenced strain from Nigeria having no significant difference (p>0.05) from other geographical regions. Significantly higher (p<0.05) infection rate and mortality from COVID 19 were observed in countries (Europe and USA) without a current universal BCG vaccination policy compared to those with one (Sub Sahara African countries). Countries with high malaria burden had significantly lower (p<0.05) cases of COVID 19 than those with low malaria burden. A strong negative correlation ( 0.595) between mean annual temperature and COVID 19 infection and death was observed with 14.8% variances between temperature and COVID 19 occurrence among the countries. A clear distinction was observed in the COVID 19 disease management between the developed countries (Europe and USA) and Sub Sahara Africa. Conclusions: The study established that the wide variation in the outcome of the COVID 19 disease burden in the selected countries are attributable largely to climatic condition (temperature) and differential healthcare approaches to management of the disease. We recommend consideration and mainstreaming of these findings for urgent intervention and management of COVID 19 across these continents."	0
1798	"COVID 19 pandemic has caused tens of thousands of deaths and is now a severe threat to global health. Clinical practice has demonstrated that the SARS CoV 2 S1 specific antibodies and viral antigens can be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers of COVID 19. However, the popular point of care biomarker detection technologies, such as the lateral flow test strips, provide only yes/no information and have very limited sensitivities. Thus, it has a high false negative rate and cannot be used for the quantitative evaluation of patient's immune response. Conventional ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), on the other hand, can provide quantitative, accurate, and sensitive results, but it involves complicated and expensive instruments and long assay time. In addition, samples need to be sent to centralized labs, which significantly increases the turn around time. Here, we present a microfluidic ELISA technology for rapid (15 20 minutes), quantitative, sensitive detection of SARS CoV 2 biomarkers using SARS CoV 2 specific IgG and viral antigen  S protein in serum. We also characterized various humanized monoclonal IgG, and identified a candidate with a high binding affinity towards SARS CoV 2 S1 protein that can serve as the calibration standard of anti SARS CoV 2 S1 IgG in serological analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our microfluidic ELISA platform can be used for rapid affinity evaluation of monoclonal anti S1 antibodies. The microfluidic ELISA device is highly portable and requires less than 10 L of samples for each channel. Therefore, our technology will greatly facilitate rapid and quantitative analysis of COVID 19 patients and vaccine recipients at point of care.

1799	Fast testing can help mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Despite their accuracy for single sample analysis, infectious diseases diagnostic tools, like RT PCR, require substantial resources to test large populations. We develop a scalable approach for determining the viral status of pooled patient samples. Our approach converts group testing to a linear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as generated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm estimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than existing noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to various applications, including where false negatives must be minimized. Finally, in a Utopian world we would have collaborated with RT PCR experts; it is difficult to form such connections during a pandemic. We welcome new collaborators to reach out and help improve this work!	0

La entrada del virus de la inmunodeficiencia humana (VIH) en la célula es la primera etapa del ciclo de replicación viral y una diana clave en la exploración de nuevos antirretrovirales. El mejor conocimiento de los mecanismos que se suceden con la entrada del VIH en las células que infecta ha permitido el desarrollo de moléculas que bloquean cada una de las etapas de la entrada vírica: unión de gp120 al receptor CD4; unión de gp120 a los correceptores de quimiocinas CCR5 y CXCR4, y fusión de las membranas viral y celular. Los inhibidores de la entrada del VIH son la última generación de antirretrovirales, de los cuales la enfuvirtida, un inhibidor de la fusión, ha sido el primero en comercializarse. Varios más se encuentran actualmente en fases avanzadas de desarrollo clínico y es de esperar que pronto contribuirán a mejorar el arsenal terapéutico frente al VIH.

1809	As the Coronavirus (COVID 19) expands its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The placing of entire cities in 'lockdown' directly affects urban economies on a multi lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation's economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and advances how smart city networks should work towards enhancing standardization protocols for increased data sharing in the event of outbreaks or disasters, leading to better global understanding and management of the same.	0

1811	"Objective In this study, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of 101 nonsurvivors with COVID 19 and analyze risk factors associated with the rapid disease progress to death after admission.
Design Retrospective study using electronic medical records.
Participants 101 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID 19 died in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University before February 15, 2020, were included in this study.
We obtained epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data from electronic medical records. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate risk factors associated with rapid disease progress to death after admission.
Among included nonsurvivors, the median age was 71.0 years (IQR, 59.0 80.0), 60 (59.4%) were men. Eighty two (79.2%) had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (58.4%), diabetes (21.8%) etc. Respiratory failure (99.0%), acute cardiac injury (52.5%), sepsis (40.6%) and acute kidney injury (22.8%) were most common complications. Patients died within 3 days of admission were more likely to develop sepsis compared with those survived 3 days of admission. Higher heart rate and respiration rate, increased white blood cell count and neutrophil count, elevated myoglobin level and depressed oxygen saturation on admission were associated with rapid disease progress to death within 3 days of admission. The AUCs for white blood cell count and neutrophil count were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.60 0.80) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.59 0.79), respectively.

Cela peut aussi expliquer l'odeur musquée du corps du furet. Les furets qui dégageaient une forte odeur faisaient les meilleurs chasseurs et, de ce fait, ont été reproduits. Le but était qu'ils pourchassent les proies sans les capturer. Les furets qui capturaient et mangeaient les lapins ne détruisaient pas seulement la source de nourriture et la fourrure, ils étaient également plus difficiles à faire ressortir du terrier. Pour décourager la capture de la proie, les furets de travail portaient parfois des harnais, avec des clochettes fixées à leur collier, ou étaient muselés. Peu à peu, la reproduction du furet a permis d'éliminer son instinct de chasse pour tuer. Le sport de la chasse du lapin au furet est encore largement pratiqué en Europe et en Australie, mais il est interdit aux États Unis et au Canada.
On pense que les furets ont été amenés aux États Unis à la fin du XVIII e siècle et servaient à contrôler la vermine à bord des bateaux effectuant les longues croisières transatlantiques 37 . Au milieu du XIX e siècle, les furets ont été reproduits pour leur fourrure, une pratique qui s'est poursuivie tardivement au cours du XX e siècle. Ce n'est que récemment que la production de fourrure est tombée en disgrâce dans une grande partie du monde.
Les furets ont été les animaux de compagnie de personnalités historiques comme Gengis Khan et la reine Élisabeth I re ; cependant, ils ne sont devenus des animaux de compagnie populaires qu'à la fin des années 1960. Cela a entraîné d'autres modifications physiques et comportementales, les croisements entre furets visant à rechercher une plus grande docilité, une odeur moins prononcée, une conformation corporelle particulière, certaines couleurs de fourrure et l'absence de développement à l'état sauvage. Au cours de la deuxième moitié du XX e siècle, le furet domestique est devenu un animal de plus en plus utilisé dans la recherche et comme animal de laboratoire.
Cette domestication du furet au cours du temps nous amène à aujourd'hui. Toutefois, l'espèce parentale précise du furet domestique n'est toujours pas connue avec certitude. Les furets ont peut être été domestiqués à partir du putois européen ou de son congénère plus oriental, le putois des steppes (Mustela eversmanni), dont la morphologie du crâne est plus proche. Comme il a été décrit que M. putorius et M. eversmanni formaient parfois des hybrides lorsque leur répartition géographique se chevauchait, les scientifiques ont débattu sur l'existence réelle de deux espèces séparées et plusieurs auteurs ont finalement considéré que les espèces M. putorius, M. eversmanni et Mustela nigripes, le furet à pieds noirs, qui est une espèce menacée d'Amérique du Nord, pouvaient représenter une seule espèce holartique 13 ."	0
1816	We propose an SEIARD mathematical model to investigate the current outbreak of coronavirus disease in Mexico. We conduct a detailed analysis of this model and demonstrate its application using publicly reported data. We calculate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) via the next generation matrix method, and we estimate the per day infection, death and recovery rates. We calibrate the parameters of the SEIARD model to the reported data by minimizing the sum of squared errors and attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak until June 2020. Our results estimate that the peak of the epidemic in Mexico will be around May 2, 2020. Our model incorporates the importance of considering the aysmptomatic infected individuals, because they represent the majority of the infected population (with symptoms or not) and they could play a huge role in spreading the virus without any knowledge.	1

1818	"Since December 2019, more than 79,000 people have been diagnosed with infection of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 . A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID 19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID 19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID 19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083).
However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56 85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62 88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52 75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non front line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63 92) (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P > 0.05). Importantly, nFLNs are more likely to suffer from VT, which might be related to two factors, namely, gender [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1717; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.247 18.808; P = 0.002] and fertility [OR = 2.072; 95%CI = 0.626 24.533; P = 0.039].

1823	Three leading infectious disease experts in China were invited to share their bedside observations in the management of COVID 19 patients. Professor Taisheng Li was sent to Wuhan to provide frontline medical care. He depicts the clinical course of SARS CoV 2 infection. Furthermore, he observes the significant abnormality of coagulation function and proposes that the early intravenous immunoglobulin and low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation therapy are very important. Professor Hongzhou Lu, a leader in China to try various anti viral drugs, expresses concern on the quality of the ongoing clinical trials as most trials are small in scale and repetitive in nature, and emphasizes the importance of the quick publication of clinical trial results. Regarding the traditional Chinese medicine, Professor Lu suggests to develop a creative evaluation system because of the complicated chemical compositions.

1824	"Objective: To investigate the clinical and CT features associated with severe and critical Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) pneumonia. Materials and Methods: Eighty three patients with COVID 19 pneumonia including 25 severe/critical cases and 58 ordinary cases were enrolled. The chest CT images and clinical data of them were reviewed and compared. The risk factors associated with disease severity were analyzed. Results: Compared with the ordinary patients, the severe/critical patients had older ages, higher incidence of comorbidities, cough, expectoration, chest pain and dyspnea. The incidences of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy paving pattern and bronchial wall thickening in severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients. Besides, severe/critical patients showed higher incidences of lymph node enlargement, pericardial effusion and pleural effusion than the ordinary patients. The CT scores of severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients ( P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the sensitivity and specificity of CT Score were 80.0% and 82.8% respectively for the discrimination of the two types. The clinical factors of age > 50 years old, comorbidities, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, expectoration, decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation indicators were risk factors for severe/critical COVID 19 pneumonia. CT findings of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy paving pattern, bronchial wall thickening, high CT scores and extrapulmonary lesions were features of severe/critical COVID 19 pneumonia. Conclusions: There are significant differences in clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations and CT manifestations between the ordinary patients and the severe/critical patients. Many factors are related to the severity of the disease, which can help clinicians to judge the severity of the patient and evaluate the prognosis.

1825	"Background Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19). Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID 19.
We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID 19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.
Findings Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R 0 of 1·5, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R 0 was 2·5 or 3·5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R 0 of 1·5 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R 0 of 2·5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R 0 of 3·5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R 0 was 1·5. For R 0 values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.
Interpretation In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID 19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts."	0

Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting infants, young children, and immune compromised patients; however, currently no vaccine is available for prevention of RSV infections. The overwhelming majority of our knowledge of how RSV causes infection is based upon studies that have been carried out using traditional 2D methods, with cells cultured on flat plastic dishes. Although these simplified culture systems are essential to gain an insight into the fundamentals of host pathogen interactions, cells in 2D are not exposed to the same conditions as cells in 3D tissues in the body and are therefore a poor representation of thein vivo microenvironment. In this study, we aim to develop the first 3D culture model for RSV infection using A549 cells to test its utility for RSV pathogenesis. Methods: To generate spheroids, A549 cells were cultured using ultra low attachment plates to generate 25 × 10 3 cell spheroids. The viability of the spheroids was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay and flow cytometry showing prominent live cells throughout the spheroids confirming high viability over seven days of incubation. Results: Immunostaining of A549 spheroids inoculated with RSV, showed time dependent dissemination of the viral antigen RSV F within the spheroid, resulting in syncytia formation and a 3 fold increase in mucin secretion compared to the uninfected cells. Additionally, RSV successfully replicated in the spheroids producing infectious virus as early as day one post inoculation and was sustained for up to 7 days post inoculation. Conclusions: Results show that A549 spheroids are susceptible and permissive for RSV since they exhibit the characteristics of RSV infection including syncytia formation and mucin overexpression, suggesting that A549 spheroids can be used a promising model for studying RSV in vitro."	0

Background: South Korea was among the first countries to report a case of the novel coronavirus (COVID 19) outside of China. As of 22 March, 2020, South Korea reported 8897 confirmed cases of and 104 deaths from COVID 19.
We collected the number of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths in South Korea from the World Health Organization (as of 21 March, 2020) and case distribution and fatality rates by age from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (as of 22 March, 2020). We estimated population level mortality rates by fitting a negative binomial regression model with the number of deaths as the outcome and population by age as an offset. We then calculated the age standardized death rate (ASDR) based on the current COVID 19 figures and for alternative scenarios of increased prevalence.
The COVID 19 population level mortality rate (per 100,000 person years) increased with age: from 0.1 deaths among 30 39 year olds to 9.5 deaths among ≥80 year olds. The ASDR (per 100,000 person years) was 0.8 deaths. The ASDR would increase to 52.0 deaths at a 1% prevalence (becoming the third leading cause of death) and 155.9 deaths at 3% prevalence (becoming the leading cause of death).
Interpretation: Currently, the population level mortality burden of COVID 19 in South Korea, as measured by the ASDR, was relatively low compared to other causes of death partly due to the low prevalence of COVID 19. If the prevalence increases from another outbreak, the mortality burden could increase substantially and surpass other leading causes."	0

• We reported real time reproductive numbers (R(t))and case fatality rate in in selected European countries (Italy, France, Germany, and Spain) by 9 March 2020.
• The R(t) was greater than 2 in the selected European countries, indicating the outbreak will continue.
Objectives: As a global pandemic is inevitable, real time monitoring of transmission is vital for containing the spread of COVID 19. The main objective was to report real time effective reproduction numbers (R(t)) case fatality rate (CFR).
Methods: Data were mainly obtained from WHO website, up to 9 March 2020. R(t) was estimated by exponential growth rate (EG) and time dependent (TD) methods. ""R0"" package in R was employed to estimate R(t) by fitting the existing epidemic curve. Both naïve CFR (nCFR) and adjust CFR (aCFR) were estimated.
: In EG method, R(t) was 3.27 [3.17 3.38] for Italy, 6.32 [5.72 6.99] for France, 6.07 [5.51 6.69] for Germany, 5.08 [4.51 5.74] for Spain.

1831	"A potential shortage of intensive care ventilators has led to the idea to ventilate more than one patient with a single ventilator. Besides other problems, this is associated with the lack of knowledge concerning distribution of tidal volume and the patients´ individual respiratory system mechanics.
In this study we used two simple hand manufactured adaptors to connect physical models of two adult respiratory systems to one ventilator. The artificial lungs were ventilated in the pressure controlled mode and we investigated if disconnecting one lung from the ventilation circuit for several breaths would allow to determine reliably the other lung's tidal volume and compliance.

1833	"Increased atrial pressure is associated with an increase in pulmonary and venous hydrostatic pressures, leading to a shift of fluid into the interstitial space, further disturbing capillary blood flow and oxygen diffusion.19 This effect is more pronounced in those clinical settings, such as COVID 19, where lung tissue architecture is already disturbed by an active and rapidly expanding inflammatory process. The widely accepted international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock (i.e., Surviving Sepsis Campaign), which have gone through much scrutiny and updates, emphasize early fluid resuscitation (30 mL/kg within the first 3 h).34 Recently, Vincent et al proposed separating management of shock into four distinct phases: rescue, optimization, stabilization, and de escalation.16 While the primary focus of the first phase is to reach the minimum effective blood volume through fluid administration, the main goal of the de escalation phase is to reach a negative fluid balance. As respiratory failure worsens, there is a need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to hypoxemia and distributive and cardiogenic shock.49 The large majority of mortality in these patients is attributed to respiratory failure and shock.6
These observations—the frequent development of ARDS and the possibility of cardiac dysfunction in addition to active expanding lung infiltrates—make it crucial for physicians to be vigilant with fluid management strategies."	0

1835	COVID 19 pandemic has become a major threat to the country. Till date, well tested medication or antidote is not available to cure this disease. According to WHO reports, COVID 19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome which is transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Analysis of this disease requires major attention by the Government to take necessary steps in reducing the effect of this global pandemic. In this study, outbreak of this disease has been analysed for India till 30 th March 2020 and predictions have been made for the number of cases for the next 2 weeks. SEIR model and Regression model have been used for predictions based on the data collected from John Hopkins University repository in the time period of 30 th January 2020 to 30 th March 2020. The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSLE and achieved 1.52 for SEIR model and 1.75 for the regression model. The RMSLE error rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01. Also, the value of R 0 which is the spread of the disease was calculated to be 2.02. Expected cases may rise between 5000 6000 in the next two weeks of time. This study will help the Government and doctors in preparing their plans for the next two weeks. Based on the predictions for short term interval, these models can be tuned for forecasting in long term intervals.	0
1836	As the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID 19) rapidly spread across China and to more than 70 countries, an increasing number of pregnant women were affected. The vertical transmission potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is of great concern to the obstetrics, neonatologists, and public health agencies. Though some studies indicated the risk of vertical transmission is low, few cases have been reported with comprehensive serial tests from multiple specimens. In this case, a female preterm infant was born to a mother with confirmed COVID 19. She presented with mild respiratory distress and received general management and a short period of nasal continuous positive airway pressure support. During her stay at the hospital, a series of SARS CoV 2 nucleic test from her throat and anal swab, serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and urine were negative.

Lucien is the highest in envelope, surface and membrane glycoprotein that is an optimal environment for rapid virus fixation on host cell's surface to the receptor molecule. Transmembrane region prediction was performed by SOSUI server. For all structural proteins, except nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein, the trans membrane prediction indicates that the virus can enter the host easily. Domain analysis was done by SMART tool. Domain information helps in the function of the viral protein. Lastly, the 3D structure prediction was carried out by Swiss Model and the result validation was achieved by PROCHECK.

The COVID 19 has proved much more pervasive demands for diagnosis that has driven researchers to develop more intelligent, highly responsive and efficient detection methods. In this work, we focus on proposing AI tools that can be used by radiologists or healthcare professionals to diagnose COVID 19 cases in a quick and accurate manner. However, the lack of a publicly available dataset of X ray and CT images makes the design of such AI tools a challenging task. To this end, this study aims to build a comprehensive dataset of X rays and CT scan images from multiple sources as well as provides a simple but an effective COVID 19 detection technique using deep learning and transfer learning algorithms. In this vein, a simple convolution neural network (CNN) and modified pretrained AlexNet model are applied on the prepared X rays and CT scan images dataset.

1850	The number of confirmed cases of COVID 19 is often used as a proxy for the actual number of ground truth COVID 19 infected cases in both public discourse and policy making. However, the number of confirmed cases depends on the testing policy, and it is important to understand how the number of positive cases obtained using different testing policies reveals the unknown ground truth. We develop an agent based simulation framework in Python that can simulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown based on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various communities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is the presence of another 'flu' like illness with symptoms similar to COVID 19, that allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be tested. We instantiate our model for the city of Bengaluru in India, using census data to distribute agents geographically, and traffic flow mobility data to model long distance interactions and mixing. We use the simulation framework to compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic Testing (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location Based Testing policy (LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come out for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with very few daily tests. However, CT consistently captures more positive cases. Interestingly, our new LBT, which is operationally less intensive than CT, gives performance that is comparable with CT. In another direction, we compare the efficacy of these three testing policies in enabling lockdown, and observe that CT flattens the ground truth curve maximally, followed closely by LBT, and significantly better than RST.	0
1851	Current CoVID 19 pandemic is spreading rapidly worldwide, and it may become one of the largest pandemic events in modern history if out of control. It appears most of the SARS CoV 2 virus infection resulted deaths are mainly due to dysfunctions or failures of the lung or multiple organs that could be attributed to host's immunodysfunctions particularly hyperinflammatory type disorders. In this brief review and study, a math model is proposed to correlate the Pathogen Infection Recovery Probability (PIRP) versus Proinflammatory Anti Pathogen Species (PIAPS) levels within a host unit, where a maximum PIRP is exhibited when the PIAPS levels are equal to or around PIAPS equilibrium levels at the pathogen elimination or clearance onset. Based on this model, rational or effective therapeutic strategies at right stages or timing, with right type of agents (immuno stimulators or immuno suppressors), and right dosages, may be designed and implemented that are expected to effectively achieve maximum PIRP or reduce the mortality.	1
1852	An initial rationale for the higher lethality rate could be the high average age of the Italian population when compared to, for example, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Korea; in the latter, the majority of confirmed COVID 19 cases are young women (62%), with 30% of positive cases in the age range of 20–30 years. Therefore, for each positive COVID 19 case, there are ~8–10 undetected cases; thus, the actual number of COVID 19 cases could be up to 10 times higher, and recalculation of the mortality rates on this basis would cause the actual national mortality rate of COVID 19 to decrease approximately to the mortality rates of COVID 19 in the People's Republic of China.	0

1856	The epidemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) infection has presented as a critical period. Until February 23 rd 2020, more than 77 000 cases of 2019 nCoV infection have been confirmed in China, which has a great impact on economy and society. It has also interferred with ordinary medical practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery seriously. In order to protect the oral and maxillofacial surgery medical staff from 2019 nCoV infection during the outbreak period, this paper suggests the necessary medical protective measures for oral and maxillofacial surgery outpatients and wards.	1
1857	We constructed a simple Susceptible Infected Infectious Excluded model of the spread of COVID 19. The model is parametrised only by the average incubation period, τ, and two rate parameters: contact rate, r C , and exclusion rate, r E . The rates can be manipulated by non therapeutic interventions and determine the E , and, together with τ, the daily multiplication coefficient at the early exponential phase, β. Initial β determines the reduction of r C required to contain epidemic spread. In the long term, we consider a scenario based on typical social behaviours, in which r C first decreases in response to a surge of daily new cases, forcing people to self isolate, and then slowly increases when people gradually accept higher risk. Consequently, initial abrupt epidemic spread is followed by a plateau and slow regression. This scenario, although economically and socially devastating, will grant time to develop, produce, and distribute a vaccine, or at least limit daily cases to a manageable number.	1

The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID 19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals' lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide. Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety and stress related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS CoV 2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID 19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS CoV 2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long term impact of COVID 19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.

Abstract
Background: The COVID 19 pandemic is an emerging concern regarding the potential 62 adverse effects during pregnancy. This study reviews knowledge on the impact of 63 COVID 19 on pregnancy and describes the outcome of published cases of pregnant 64 women diagnosed with COVID 19, as well as the characteristics of COVID 19 positive 65 women who delivered in Portugal by 31 of March 2020. 66 Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed® up to 8 April 2020, using PRISMA 67 standards, to identify original published studies describing pregnant women at any 68 gestational age diagnosed COVID 19. There were no date or language restrictions on the 69 search. All identified studies were included irrespective of assumptions on study quality. 70 Portuguese cases were ascertained by contact with all Portuguese maternities and based 71 on the information provided by their health professionals. 72 Results: We identified 30 original studies reporting 212 cases of pregnant women with 73 COVID 19 (30 discharged while pregnant), 200 from China and 12 from other countries. 74 The 182 published deliveries resulted in one stillbirth and 185 live births. Four women 75 with severe COVID 19 required admission to an intensive care unit but no cases of 76 maternal death were reported. There was one neonatal death. Preterm births occurred in 77 28.7% of cases, but it is unclear whether this was iatrogenic. All cases with amniotic fluid, 78 placenta, and/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS CoV 2 virus were negative. Four 79 newborns were positive for SARS CoV 2 and three newborns had high levels of IgM 80 antibodies. None of the first eight infants born in Portugal tested positive. Breast milk 81 samples from 13 mothers and described in seven studies showed no evidence of SARS 82 CoV 2. : medRxiv preprint 5 Conclusion: The evidence related to the effect of COVID 19 on pregnant women is still 84 limited.

As we had previously reported loss of bacterial diversity over time among the patients included in these analyses (2), this suggests that either loss of bacterial diversity or changes in the oral environment under conditions of chemotherapeutic and antimicrobial pressure or both affect the bacterium fungus interplay. Although this report highlights the underappreciated complex and dynamic nature of the cross kingdom interactions that occur over time and result from the stress of chemotherapy and antibiotic therapy, these data are limited by our having used only marker gene analysis (16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer 2 [ITS2] sequencing) to identify bacterium fungus	1

We extracted COVID 19 related symptoms mentioned by the users, mapped them to standard IDs, and compared the distributions with multiple studies conducted in clinical settings.
We identified 203 positive tested users who reported 932 symptoms using 598 unique expressions. The most frequently reported symptoms were fever/pyrexia (65%), cough (56%), body aches/pain (40%), headache (35%), fatigue (35%), and dyspnea (34%) amongst users who reported at least 1 symptom.

1867	In this work we analyse the growth of the cumulative number of confirmed infected cases by the COVID 19 until March 27 th , 2020, from countries of Asia, Europe, North and South America. Our results show (i) that power law growth is observed for all countries; (ii) by using the distance correlation, that the power law curves between countries are statistically highly correlated, suggesting the universality of such curves around the World; and (iii) that soft quarantine strategies are inefficient to flatten the growth curves. Furthermore, we present a model and strategies which allow the government to reach the flattening of the power law curves. We found that, besides the social distance of individuals, of well known relevance, the strategy of identifying and isolating infected individuals in a large daily rate, can help to flatten the power laws. These are essentially the strategies used in the Republic of Korea. The high correlation between the power law curves of different countries strongly indicate that the government containment measures can be applied with success around the whole possible.	0

We observed that the combination of CQ or HCQ and metformin, which were used in our studies as potential anti cancer drugs, killed 30 40% of mice. While our observations in mice may not translate to toxicity in humans, the reports that CQ or HCQ has anti COVID 19 activity, the use of CQ resulting in toxicity and at least one death, and the recent Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for CQ and HCQ by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prompted our report. Here we report the lethality of CQ or HCQ in combination with metformin as a warning of its potential serious clinical toxicity. We hope that our report will be helpful to stimulate pharmacovigilance and monitoring of adverse drug reactions with the use of CQ or HCQ, particularly in combination with metformin.	0

1871	"The alarming spread of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the SARS CoV 2 virus is requiring several measures to reduce the risk of contagion. Every successful strategy in controlling SARS CoV2 infection depends on the timely viral diagnosis which should include asymptomatic carriers.
Consequently, strategies to increase the throughput for clinical laboratories to conduct large scale diagnostic testing are urgently needed. Here we support the hypothesis that standard diagnostic protocol for SARS CoV 2 virus could be conveniently applied to pooled samples obtained from different subjects. We suggest that a two step sequential pooling procedure could identify positive subjects, ensuring at the same time significant benefits of costs and time. Simulation data are used to assess the efficiency, in terms of number of required tests, both for random assignment of the subjects to the pools and for situations when epidemiological and clinical data are used to create an ""informed"" version of the pooling. Different scenarios are examined in the simulations to measure the effect of different pool sizes and different values for the virus frequency. Our results allow to customize the pooling strategy according to the specific characteristics of the cohort to be tested. : medRxiv preprint
Recently, Hogan et al (2020) [7] performed a retrospective study on SARS CoV 2 based on sample pooling.
""Pooling"" means that swab samples taken from different subjects can be combined before the RNA extraction phase. These Authors used 2888 samples from nasopharyngeal and bronchoalveolar lavages that were collected between January 1, 2020, and February 26, 2020, from subjects who had not been tested for SARS CoV 2. Nine or ten samples were pooled, and screening was performed by RT PCR. A total of 292 pools were screened and the confirmed positivity rate for SARS CoV 2 was 0.07% (2/2888). The aim of pooling is to reduce the number of test kits used, significantly shortening the time and costs of analysis. As reported by on line media (https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/science/articles/pooling covid 19 israel), a pooling approach has also recently being successfully used in Israel but, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been published yet. Scientists from the Technion Israel Institute of Technology stated that when 64 samples are mixed together, the analysis on the pool test gives a positive result even if just one of the swabs came from an infected subject. The pooled sample can give laboratory results of equal quality of those with individual testing because there are no changes to the RT PCR diagnostic protocol.
The basic concepts for understanding the pooling strategy are simple: 1) only a pool made up of all negative samples will give a negative result for the pool analysis; 2) a single positive sample within a pool makes the All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission."	0

We analysed data on laboratory confirmed COVID 19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (R t ) for COVID 19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time.

1875	"Objective: To investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of SARS CoV 2 infections and their associations with public perceptions in China Design: Cross sectional population based telephone survey via random digital dialing between 1 and 10 February, 2020 Setting: Wuhan (the epicentre and quarantined city), and Shanghai (a typical major city with close transportation link with Wuhan) Participants: Random sample of 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai aged above 18 Main outcome measures: Anxiety (measured by the 7 item generalized anxiety disorder [GAD 7] scale), recommended and avoidance behaviors (engaged in all six behaviors such as increasing surface cleaning and reducing going out).
Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score ≥10 on GAD 7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p<0.001). Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3 1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4 1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5 1.9). Having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5 0.7).
The strongest predictor of behavioral change was perceived severity (1.2, 1.1 1.4) , followed by confusion about information reliability (1.1, 1.0 1.3).
Conclusions: Psychological and behavioral responses to COVID 19 have been dramatic during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our results support efforts for timely dissemination of accurate and reliable information to address the high anxiety level.

1878	A positive pressure protective hood system was purposefully constructed only from materials commonly found worldwide, including bendable aluminum mesh, elastic head straps, velcro tape, a plastic sheet, a furnace filter and two computer central processing unit (CPU) cooling fans. The practical advantages of this system are that the materials are readily available in the inventories of most electronics and hardware outlets, ease of assembly (particularly if choosing to employ 3D printing for the fan enclosure and/or making several units at once with a defined workflow), and high probability of the materials being available in current or prospective personal protective equipment (PPE) deplete regions. An experiment with identical fire detectors showed adequate inner isolation of the hood prototype from paper combustion particulates, which have a size range slightly smaller than putative coronavirus aerosols, for at least 90 seconds. The theoretical advantages of this system include significant reduction in healthcare provider exposure to coronavirus containing respiratory fomites, respiratory droplets and aerosols (vs. traditional static masks and shields) during high risk procedures such as endotracheal intubation or routine care of an upright and coughing patient. Additionally, the assembly eliminates contact exposure to coronavirus fomites due to whole head coverage from a hood system.	0

Our understanding of the pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) has improved dramatically in recent years. Patients with FIP apparently represent only a small fraction of cats infected with coronaviruses, because many cats in the general feline population have antibodies that cross react with FIP virus (FIPV). Continuing investigation into the seroepizootiology of FIPV has raised more questions than have been answered. Do most strains of FIPV cause no more than a localized infection and a chronic asymptomatic carrier state? Are all strains of FIPV of equal virulence, with the immunologic response of the infected cat solely determining the eventual outcome?

Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus receptor inhibitor within this short period of time.
Here, attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination strategies with a comparison of spike glycoproteins among SARS CoV, MERS CoV and the SARS CoV 2. We verified their structure quality (SWISS MODEL, Phyre2, Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of SARS CoV 2 based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and MHC/paratopic binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects. We screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic regions and selected their energetic, IC50, MHC II reactivity and found some of those to be very good target for vaccination. A possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic recognition.

Les zoonoses, distinguées ici des maladies humaines d'origine animale, représentent un ensemble d'entités pathologiques dont les agents responsables circulent régulièrement entre l'espèce humaine et de nombreuses espèces de vertébrés. L'analyse de divers exemples, quelles que soient les voies de transmission et les causes favorisantes de la contamination, met en avant une régulière rareté du passage direct du réservoir animal vers l'espèce humaine, à opposer à la diversité et surtout à la gravité possible des évolutions sanitaires ultérieures possibles, parfois liées à des comportements humains peu adaptés. D'un point de vue pratique, il semblerait plus pertinent de se pencher d'abord sur un meilleur contrôle de la diffusion des agents pathogènes au sein des populations humaines que d'agir a priori sur le réservoir animal, qu'il soit domestique ou sauvage, source potentielle de ces agents pathogènes mais selon des modalités difficiles à anticiper. La relation entre biodiversité et santé est abordée à l'occasion de la discussion.

The place of vertebrates in the epidemiology of zoonoses Zoonoses, to be distinguished here from human diseases with an animal origin, represent a large quantity of pathological entities the corresponding pathogens of which are regularly shared between human beings and many different vertebrates species. Working on selected examples and situations, whatever the contamination routes and the facilitating reasons, puts into light a real rarity of a direct transmission from the animal reservoir to human beings. On the opposite, the diversity and the possible severity of some of the sanitary consequences, quite often in relation to human behaviours, must be stressed. On a practical point of view, it seems more adapted to try first to improve the control of pathogens diffusion within human populations after a contamination than to try to start to work first on the reservoir, be it domestic or wild, the potential source of these pathogens, but following routes quite difficult to anticipate. The relationship between biodiversity and health is discussed.

1895	"Up to 24 February 2020, there have been 77,269 officially reported confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection in China. Circulatory dysfunction is considered to have a late onset in severe cases of nCoV pneumonia, which is often ignored in clinical treatment. The main causes of acute respiratory failure and subsequent circulatory dysfunction include the rapid progress of lung injury, fluid overload, lung consolidation, and mechanical ventilation for hypoxemia. Most injuries are related to fluid overload, acute lung injury, and longterm hypoxia. Echocardiographic is an important part of critical ultrasonography, which helps to quickly identify the hemodynamic status. We summarized the echocardiographic features of critically ill COVID 19 patients and its clinical use in the treatment of nCoV pneumonia.
The echocardiographic features of COVID 19 are mainly related to the severity of disease and cardiovascular complications. Abnormal findings include (1) hyperdynamic cardiac function, presented as the increase of cardiac output (CO) and ejection faction (EF) of the left ventricular (LV), with/without the decrease of peripheral vascular resistance, which is often seen in the early stage following the systemic inflammatory response; (2) acute stress induced (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy, characterized as LV segmental contraction abnormalities and apical ballooning [1]; (3) right ventricular (RV) enlargement and acute pulmonary hypertension, which are mainly caused by ""internal factors"" (including alveolar and pulmonary capillary damage caused by inflammation, hypoxia, and hypercapnia, leading to the increase of RV afterload) and ""external factors"" (including fluid overload, which causes the increase of RV preload, and unsuitable mechanical ventilation parameter setting, which affects the cardiac function by cardiopulmonary interaction); further, LV function will be affected because the right and left hearts are in the same pericardium; and (4) diffuse myocardial inhibition in the late stage, which is often caused by severe hypoxia, and long term of anoxia and inflammation. The echocardiographic features of nCoV pneumonia and their probable causes are shown in Table 1 .
Echocardiography can help to quickly identify the circulatory status of nCoV pneumonia patients and guide hemodynamic management. Five basic views of echocardiography (apical four chamber view, parasternal long axis view, parasternal short axis view, subarachnoid four chamber view, subarachnoid inferior vena cava (IVC) long and short axis view) should be measured, which help to quickly understand the patient's volume status, cardiac function, and organ perfusion and help to develop hemodynamic management plans. It is suggested to measure the diameter of IVC, EF, velocity time integral of the left ventricular outflow during continuous and dynamic evaluation of patients' volume state and fluid responsiveness, left ventricular systolic function, and left ventricular output effect. If necessary, hemodynamic management can follow the ""5P"" principle, i.e., lower central venous pressure, optimized pulse/heart rate, appropriate pump function and blood pressure, and organ perfusion as the final goal."	0
1896	"Background: Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases such as the novel Coronavirus 23 disease, COVID 19 and Ebola pose a significant threat to global society and test the public 24 health community's preparedness to rapidly respond to an outbreak with effective diagnostics 25 and therapeutics. Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies enable rapid 26 generation of pathogen genome sequence data, within 24 hours of obtaining a sample in some 27 instances. With these data, one can quickly evaluate the effectiveness of existing diagnostics and 28 therapeutics using in silico approaches. The propensity of some viruses to rapidly accumulate 29 mutations can lead to the failure of molecular detection assays creating the need for redesigned 30 or newly designed assays.
Results: Here we describe a bioinformatics system named BioLaboro to identify signature 32 regions in a given pathogen genome, design PCR assays targeting those regions, and then test the 33 PCR assays in silico to determine their sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate BioLaboro 34 with two use cases: Bombali Ebolavirus (BOMV) and the novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS CoV 35 2). For the BOMV, we analyzed 30 currently available real time reverse transcription PCR 36 assays against the three available complete genome sequences of BOMV. Only two met our in 37 silico criteria for successful detection and neither had perfect matches to the primer/probe 38 sequences. We designed five new primer sets against BOMV signatures and all had true positive 39 hits to the three BOMV genomes and no false positive hits to any other sequence. Four assays 40 are closely clustered in the nucleoprotein gene and one is located in the glycoprotein gene.

Similarly, for the SARS CoV 2, we designed five highly specific primer sets that hit all 145 42 whole genomes (available as of February 28, 2020) and none of the near neighbors. : bioRxiv preprint 3 Conclusions: Here we applied BioLaboro in two real world use cases to demonstrate its 44 capability; 1) to identify signature regions, 2) to assess the efficacy of existing PCR assays to 45 detect pathogens as they evolve over time, and 3) to design new assays with perfect in silico 46 detection accuracy, all within hours, for further development and deployment. BioLaboro is 47 designed with a user friendly graphical user interface for biologists with limited bioinformatics 48 experience. 49 Background 50 Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases have serious adverse impacts on society 51 with respect to lives lost and annual economic losses [1 5], as being witnessed currently in the 52 COVID 19 outbreak caused by a novel Coronavirus, SARS CoV 2. As of March 9, 2020, there 53 have been 113,584 confirmed cases of COVID 19 around the globe and 3,996 deaths [6 8]. 54 Factors such as climate change, urbanization, zoonotic spillover, international travel, lack or 55 breakdown of public health care systems, natural or man made disasters, and pathogen evolution 56 to name a few, contribute to infectious disease emergence and sustainment [2]. 57 A unique challenge associated with emerging infectious diseases is rapidly identifying 58 the etiological agent and developing or repurposing existing medical countermeasures (MCMs), 59 including diagnostic assays, to curtail the spread of an outbreak. With respect to reemerging 60 infectious diseases the challenge is to determine whether existing MCMs are effective or not, and 61 in the latter case, develop or modify the MCMs in a timely manner. In some cases, the failure of 62 existing MCMs can be accounted for by genetic drift and shift and the resulting altered genotypic 63 and phenotypic profiles of the newly emergent pathogen. Ebolavirus is one such reemerging 64 infectious disease agent that exhibits high degrees of genetic changes in every new outbreak."	0

1898	"Background: Exponential like infection growths leading to peaks (which could be the inflection points or turning points) are usually the hallmarks of infectious disease outbreaks including coronaviruses. To predict the inflection points, i.e., inflection time (T max ) & maximal infection number (I max ) of the novel coronavirus (COVID 19), we adopted a trial and error strategy and explored a series of approaches from simple logistic modeling (that has an asymptomatic line) to sophisticated tipping point detection techniques for detecting phase transitions but failed to obtain satisfactory results.
Method: Inspired by its success in diversity time relationship (DTR), we apply the PLEC (power law with exponential cutoff) model for detecting the inflection points of COVID 19 outbreaks.
The model was previously used to extend the classic species time relationship (STR) for general DTR (Ma 2018), and it has two ""secondary"" parameters (computed from its 3 parameters including power law scaling parameter w, taper off parameter d to overwhelm virtually exponential growth ultimately, and a parameter c related to initial infections): one that was originally used for estimating the potential or 'dark' biodiversity is proposed to estimate the maximal infection number (I max ) and another is proposed to determine the corresponding inflection time point (T max ).
We successfully estimated the inflection points [I max , T max ] for most provinces (≈85%)
in China with error rates <5% in both I max and T max . We also discussed the constraints and limitations of the proposed approach, including (i) sensitive to disruptive jumps, (ii) requiring sufficiently long datasets, and (iii) limited to unimodal outbreaks. : medRxiv preprint Ma, ZS (2018b) Diversity time period and diversity time area relationships exemplified by the human microbiome.

1899	"To assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019 nCoV.
We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019 nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks
were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total.
We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.
Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks.
The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.
Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019 nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts."	0

1901	"Objective: To investigate the impact of the COVID 19 outbreak on the medical advice seeking of Chinese children with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
: An anonymous online questionnaire survey was conducted in 17 pediatric nephropathy diagnosis and treatment centers in China. The questions collected basic information on the patients and their parents and data on changes in the approach to medical treatment and their needs in the context of the outbreak etc.
This is a Multicenter Cross section Study.
Results: A total of 735 valid questionnaires were collected. 555 patients (75.5%) and their parents said that the outbreak had a significant influence on their medical treatment: 264 patients (47.6%) said that it would be delayed by 2 to 4 weeks and 199 patients (35.9%) by 4 to 8 weeks. 510 patients (84.16%) hoped to get in touch with specialists through online consultation, and 528 patients (84.5%) hoped that online consultation could be implemented and that medication could be delivered to them.. A total of 458 patients (62.3%) said that their greatest concern was that the CKD would be aggravated or that they would experience a relapse; only 203 patients were infected by 2019 nCoV. A total of 313 patients (42.5%) experienced anxiety and thus required the intervention of psychologists. Conclusion: The COVID 19 outbreak has affected the medical treatment of children with CKD. Online consultation, medication delivery and psychological counselling are the greatest needs reported by patients and their families and could especially provide solutions for the management of low income children with CKD in remote rural areas in the context of the COVID 19 epidemic.
The study can well explore the impact of COVID 19 outbreak on the medical treatment of CKD children in China and the needs of current patients.
The study explored ways to meet the medical needs of CKD children in the context of a public health emergency of international concern, which provides a method support for all countries in the world experiencing COVID 19 outbreak.
The study is an exploration of the coping strategies for CKD management in China.

1902	"Background: India is the second largest population in the world, and it is not well equipped, hitherto, in the scenario of the global pandemic, SARS CoV 2 could impart a devastating impact on the Indian population. Only way to respond against this critical condition is by practicing large scale social distancing. India lock down for 21 days, however, till 7 April 2020, SARS CoV 2 positive cases were growing exponentially, which raises the concerns if the number of reported and actual cases are similar.
and Polynomial features of degree 2 to predict the growth factor. Also, we predicted Logistic curve using the Prophet Python. Further, using the growth rate to logistic, and carrying capacity is 20000 allowed us to calculate the maximum cases and new cases per day.
We found the predicted growth factor with a standard deviation of 0.3443 for the upcoming days. When the growth factor becomes 1.0, which is known as Inflection point, it will be safe to state that the rate is no longer exponential. The estimated time to reach the inflection point is between 15 20 April. At that time, the estimated number of total positive cases will be over 12500, if lockdown remains continue.
Our analysis suggests that there is an urgent need to take action to extend the period of lockdown and allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. Otherwise, the outbreak in India can reach the level of the USA or Italy or could be worse than these countries within a few days resources."	0

1905	"Since the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic, multiple efforts of modelling of the geo temporal transmissibility of the virus have been undertaken, but none succeeded in describing the pandemic at the global level. We propose a set of parameters for the first COVID 19 Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEaM). The simulation starting with just a single pre symptomatic, yet infectious, case in Wuhan, China, results in an accurate prediction of the number of diagnosed cases after 135 days in multiple countries across four continents.
We have built a modified SIR metapopulation transmission model and parameterized it analytically according to the literature, and by fitting the missing parameters to the observed dynamics of the virus spread. We compared our results with the number of diagnosed cases in sixteen selected countries which provide reliable statistics but differ substantially in terms of strength and speed of undertaken precautions. The obtained 95% confidence intervals for the predictions fit well to the empirical data.
The parameters that successfully model the pandemic are: the basic reproduction number R 0 , ~4.4; a latent non infectious period of 1.1. days followed by 4.6 days of the presymptomatic infectious period; the probability of developing severe symptoms, 0.01; the probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001.
Parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both R 0 and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated. This is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented COVID 19 cases. Consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated.

1906	"Introduction: Early during the SARS CoV 2 pandemic, Australian emergency departments (EDs) have experienced an unprecedented surge in patients seeking screening for Understanding what proportion of these patients require screening, who can be safely screened in community based models of care, and who requires an emergency departments to care for them is critical for workforce and infrastructure planning across the healthcare system, as well as public messaging campaigns.
Methodss: In this cross sectional survey, we screened patients presenting to a SARS CoV 2 screening clinic in a tertiary hospital Emergency Department in Melbourne, Australia. We assessed the proportion of patients who met screening criteria; self reported symptom severity; reasons why they came to the ED for screening; views on community based models of care; and sources of information accessed about COVID 19.
Results: We included findings from 1846 patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) for COVID 19 screening from 18th to 30th March 2020. Most patients (55.3%) did not meet criteria for screening and most (57.6%) had mild or no (13.4%) symptoms. The main reason for coming to the ED was being referred by a telephone health service (31.3%) and 136 (7.4%) said they tried to contact their GP but could not get an appointment. Only 47 (2.6%) said they thought the disease was too specialized for their GP to manage. Patients accessed numerous information sources, commonly government websites (68.4%) and other websites (51.3%) for COVID 19 information.
Conclusions: if we are to ensure that emergency departments can cope with the likely surge in presentations requiring resuscitation or inpatient care COVID 19, we should strengthen access to alternative services to triage patients to prevent unnecessary presentations at health services, and to direct those who are well but require screening away from EDs."	0
1907	Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID 19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay at home orders. We present an original dataset of state level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID 19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing policies.

1910	In December 2019, a cluster of patients with emerging pneumonia of unknown etiology were discovered in Wuhan city, China. Laboratory examination identified a novel coronavirus which was tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. The WHO has more recently formally named the 2019 nCoV as coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID 19). Within one month, the novel coronavirus rapidly spread across the whole of China through droplet transmission and contact transmission, and the reported number of confirmed COVID 19 cases demonstrated a rising trend. Radiological examinations, especially computed tomography CT, were confirmed as effective methods for the screening and diagnosis of infected cases. Reports stated that many radiologists and technologists were being infected when examining patients with COVID 19. In order to clarify the imaging features of COVID 19 and reduce the infection risk of medical personnel in radiology departments, we summarized the experience on radiological examinations and infection prevention for COVID departments.	0
1911	A PHEIC is defined as “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response” whose scope may include: serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected; carries implications for public health beyond the affected State’s national border; and may require immediate international action [3]. Here, as technological tools and laboratories around the world share data and collectively work to devise tools and cures, similar efforts should be considered between smart city professionals on how collaborative strategies could allow for the maximization of public safety on such and similar scenarios. Similarly, though substantial data and information on the disease has been shared, Wetsman [25] acknowledges that there is a lack of some vital information, like the ease of spread of the virus from person to person, and this is a key to containing the disease as interactions between people from different parts of the globe are still active. An example of how beneficial collaboration and sharing of data can be occurred during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa where scientists, health workers and clinicians, amongst other stakeholders from around the world, openly worked [37].	0

The clinical features and laboratory results of different age groups are different due to the general susceptibility of the disease. The laboratory findings of COVID 19 in pregnant women are also conflicting. Para clinical investigations including laboratory tests and radiologic findings play an important role in early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of severe acute respiratory syndrome and coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2).

1914	"A novel coronavirus (the SARS CoV 2) has been identified in January 2020 as the causal pathogen for COVID 19 pneumonia, an outbreak started near the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China. The SARS CoV 2 was found to be closely related to the SARS CoV, based on the genomic analysis. The Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) utilized by the SARS CoV as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of SARS CoV 2, initiated by the binding of the spike protein to the human ACE2. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods, we report here the detailed structure of the ACE2 in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS CoV 2 spike protein. The predicted model is highly consistent with the experimentally determined complex structures. Besides the binding interface reported in the crystal structures, new plausible binding poses were revealed from all atom MD simulations. The simulation data helped identify critical residues at the complex interface and provided more details about the interactions between the SARS CoV 2 RBD and human ACE2.

1917	It is critical to understand the impact of distinct policy interventions to the ongoing December 2019 coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) pandemic. We develop a flexible behavioral, dynamic, and sectorial epidemic policy model comprising both endogenous virus transmission and public health and citizen responses. Applicable to the full epidemic cycle including resurgence, the model allows exploring the multivariate impact of distinct policy interventions, including general and targeted testing and social contact reduction efforts. Calibrating the model to the early SARS CoV 2 outbreak at the level of continents, we demonstrate how early, rapid, and extensive buildup of testing and social contact reduction efforts interplay to suppress the outbreak. Next, applying the model within hypothetical contexts we demonstrate how: i) sociodemographic variation in vulnerability to the virus affects overall reported and actual outbreak patterns; ii) feasible timing of deconfinement depends on earlier responses to the outbreak; and, iii) targeted approaches help suppress resurgent outbreaks and their various impacts. Finally, given the importance of broad support of outbreak control efforts, across public health experts, policymakers, volunteers, media, and citizens, we make the model also accessible in the form of a free web based management flight simulator.	0

A novel technique is proposed to identify the lead lag relationship between time series. 2. Comparisons along statistical significance and forecast ability, show its superiority over other state of the art models 3. Aligned Correlation measure is proposed, which satisfies most of the metric properties. 4. The technique is used to study the FX market, as the covid 19 epidemic unfolds.
The lead lag relationship plays a vital role in financial markets. It is the phenomenon where a certain price series lags behind and partially replicates the movement of leading time series.
The present research proposes a new technique which helps better identify the lead lag relationship empirically. Apart from better identifying the lead lag path, the technique also gives a measure for adjudging closeness between financial time series. Also, the proposed measure is closely related to correlation, and it uses Dynamic Programming technique for finding the optimal lead lag path. Further, it retains most of the properties of a metric, so much so, it is termed as 'loose metric'. Tests are performed on Synthetic Time Series (STS) with known lead lag relationship and comparisons are done with other state of the art models on the basis of significance and forecastability. The proposed technique gives the best results in both the tests. It finds paths which are all statistically significant, and its forecasts are closest to the target values.

1930	"Unlike MERS CoV and SARS CoV where widespread international transmission was limited by high case fatality rates and more limited person to person transmission (in some instances happening to a large extent in health care and research facilities), SARS CoV 2 has shown a relatively lower case fatality rate and easy person to person transmission, potentially even during the asymptomatic phase of the disease, leading to a rapid global spread and causing the first known coronavirus pandemic[5]. Interestingly, in our experience at our hospital in New York we have observed that mild diarrhea can be present in a much larger proportion of patients, reaching a prevalence of more than 50% in patients admitted with COVID 19, suggesting a possible different clinical manifestation in the North American population. Regarding immunosuppressive medication used in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune hepatitis, the current guidance from a multi society task force recommends continuation of medication given that risk of disease flare and associated complications currently outweighs the risk of contracting COVID 19[27]. While some authors have suggested using N95 respirators only for confirmed or high risk cases and during upper endoscopy in intermediate risk patients, it should be noted that near universal spread of the virus across communities will qualify almost all patients as ""high risk"" according to the current procedures[37,39]."	0

Design: An online survey was sent to current fertility patients Setting: New York City academic fertility practice at the epicenter of the COVID 19 pandemic Patient(s): Fertility patients seen within the last year Intervention(s): None Main Outcome Measures(s): Patient agreement with the ASRM recommendations during the COVID 19 pandemic and the emotional impact rated on a Likert scale.
Result(s): A total of 518 patients completed the survey for a response rate of 17%. Fifty percent of respondents had a cycle canceled due to the COVID 19 pandemic. Of those who had a cycle cancelled, 85% of respondents found it to be moderately to extremely upsetting with 22% rating it to be equivalent to the loss of a child. There was no difference on the emotional impact based on the type of cycle cancelled. Fifty five percent of patients agreed that diagnostic procedures such as hysterosalpingograms should be cancelled while 36% of patients agreed all fertility cycles should be cancelled. Patients were slightly more likely to agree with the ASRM guidelines if they have an upcoming cycle cancelled (p = 0.041).

1939	"The World Health Organization has declared COVID 19 caused by the newly discovered SARS CoV 2 a pandemic. Due to growing demand for reagents and/ or kits to extract SARS CoV 2 RNA for subsequent RT qPCR diagnostics, there is a worldwide risk of shortages. With a detection sensitivity of 97.4% (95% CI: 86.2 99.9%), we describe a simple, fast, alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS CoV 2, where samples are simply heat processed for 5 min at 98 °C before a commonly used RT qPCR procedure.
Coronavirus disease (COVID 19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2), was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and then spread worldwide in a few months [1] . There is currently a global shortage of viral nucleic acid (NA) extraction kits, which is affecting the diagnosis of an increasing number of suspected COVID 19 cases. The aim of this study was to investigate a new simplified workflow for molecular detection of SARS CoV 2 that does not require NA extraction and could serve as an alternative in diagnostic laboratories to overcome chemical based kit shortages.
NA purification before PCR/reverse transcription (RT) PCR is the gold standard for molecular diagnostics. The MagNa Pure 96 system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States (US)) is a widely used system for high throughput NA purification in many public health laboratories worldwide [2]. However, with Roche's announcement of emerging kitshortages and bottlenecks in kit production processes [3], we investigated if real time RT PCR (RT qPCR) analysis could be performed with minimal pre treatment of samples. We used the most common sample type (oropharyngeal swabs) collected from patients suspected of COVID 19 in Denmark.
Three simplified approaches, which involved minimal handling of the samples before the RT qPCR for SARS CoV 2 were employed to avoid the NA purification step. The first approach was direct: 5 µL of the saline/transport solution from the throat swab were added to the RT qPCR reaction without any treatment. The second was a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) diluted approach: the saline/transport solution was further diluted 1:1 with PBS before adding 5 µL directly to the RT qPCR reaction. The third was a heat processed method: we compared four different heat processes on 10 µL of the saline/transport solution from the throat swab, (i) 5 min at 95 °C, (ii) 10 min at 95 °C, (iii) 5 min at 98 °C and (iv) 10 min at 98 °C, respectively. All heat processed clinical samples were cooled for 2 min at 4 °C before 5 µL were used in the RT qPCR reaction. Two SARS CoV 2 RT qPCR assays were used: (i) the published and widely used RT qPCR assay for the envelope (E) gene [4, 5] combined with the SensiFAST Probe No ROX One Step Real time PCR kit (Bioline Meridian BioScience, Cincinnati, Ohio, US), and (ii) the commercial RealStar SARS CoV 2 RT PCR kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany). We employed 87 patient samples, comprising 65 positive and 22 negative for SARS CoV 2. The RT qPCR results (number of positives and cycle threshold (Ct) values) from the different approaches were compared with the RT qPCR results from MagNA Pure 96 or QIAcube Connect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) purified samples. The switch from the MagNA Pure 96 to the QIAcube Connect system to extract NA, was necessary due to a shortage of processing cartridges for the MagNA Pure 96 system. Of the 65 positive samples, 39 samples were purified on the MagNA Pure 96 system, 50 samples on the QIAcube Connect system and 24 samples were purified using both NA extraction methods. The comparison of the SensiFAST Probe No ROX One Step Real time PCR results using the simplified workflow to both NA purification systems is shown in Table 1, Table  2 and the Figure. "	0

1942	Newly emerging pandemics like COVID 19 call for better predictive models to implement early and precisely tuned responses to their deep impact on society. Standard epidemic models provide a theoretically well founded description of dynamics of disease incidence. For COVID 19 with infectiousness peaking before and at symptom onset, the SEIR model explains the hidden build up of exposed individuals which challenges containment strategies, in particular, due to delayed epidemic responses to non pharmaceutical interventions. However, spatial heterogeneity questions the adequacy of of a whole country. Here we show that sequential data assimilation of a stochastic version of the standard SEIR epidemic model captures dynamical behavior of outbreaks on the regional level. Such regional modeling of epidemics with relatively low numbers of infected and realistic demographic noise accounts for both spatial heterogeneity and stochasticity. Based on adapted regional models, population level short term predictions can be achieved. More realistic epidemic models that include spatial heterogeneity are within reach via sequential data assimilation methods.	1
1943	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) has infected more than 1.3 million individuals all over the world and caused more than 106,000 deaths. One major hurdle in controlling the spreading of this disease is the inefficiency and shortage of medical tests. There have been increasing efforts on developing deep learning methods to diagnose COVID 19 based on CT scans. However, these works are difficult to reproduce and adopt since the CT data used in their studies are not publicly available. Besides, these works require a large number of CTs to train accurate diagnosis models, which are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we aim to address these two problems. We build a publicly available dataset containing hundreds of CT scans positive for COVID 19 and develop sample efficient deep learning methods that can achieve high diagnosis accuracy of COVID 19 from CT scans even when the number of training CT images are limited. Specifically, we propose an Self Trans approach, which synergistically integrates contrastive self supervised learning with transfer learning to learn powerful and unbiased feature representations for reducing the risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed Self Trans approach compared with several state of the art baselines. Our approach achieves an F1 of 0.85 and an AUC of 0.94 in diagnosing COVID 19 from CT scans, hundred.	0
1944	"SARS COV 2 identified as COVID 19 in Wuhan city of China in the month of December, 2019 has now been declared as pandemic by World Health Organization whose transmission chain and cure both have emerged as a tough problem for the medical fraternity. The reports pertaining to the treatment of this pandemic are still lacking. We firmly believe that Nature itself provides a simple solution for any complicated problem created in it which motivated us to carry out In Silico investigations on some bioactive natural compounds reportedly found in the fruits and leaves of Anthocephalus Cadamba which is a miraculous plant found on the earth aiming to predict the potential inhibitors against aforesaid virus.
Having modeled the ground state ligand structure of the such nine natural compounds applying density functional theory at B3LYP/631 G (d, p) level we have performed their molecular docking with SARS COV 2 protease to calculate the binding affinity as well as to screen the binding at S protein site during ligand protein interactions. Out of these nine studied naturally occurring compounds; Oleanic Acid has been appeared to be potential inhibitor for COVID 19 followed by Ursolic Acid, IsoVallesiachotamine,Vallesiachotamine,Cadambine,Vincosamide N Oxide, Isodihydroaminocadambine, Pentyle Ester of Chlorogenic Acid and D Myo Inositol. Hence these bioactive natural compounds or their structural analogs may be explored as anti COVID19 drug agent which will be possessing the peculiar feature of cost less synthesis and less or no side effect due to their natural occurrence. The solubility and solvent effect related to the phytochemicals may be the point of concern.
The In vivo investigations on these proposed natural compounds or on their structural analogs are invited for designing and developing the potential medicine/vaccine for the treatment of COVID 19

As a matter of fact, a new SARS type virus, SARS CoV 2, is responsible of a global pandemic in 2020 with unprecedented sanitary and economic consequences for most countries. In the present contribution we study, by all atom equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, the interaction between the SARS Unique Domain and RNA guanine quadruplexes, a process involved in eluding the defensive response of the host thus favoring viral infection of human cells. The results obtained evidence two stable binding modes with guanine quadruplexes, driven either by electrostatic (dimeric mode) or by dispersion (monomeric mode) interactions, are proposed being the dimeric mode the preferred one, according to the analysis of the corresponding free energy surfaces. The effect of these binding modes in stabilizing the protein dimer was also assessed, being related to its biological role in assisting SARS viruses to bypass the host protective response.
This work also constitutes a first step of the possible rational design of efficient therapeutic agents aiming at perturbing the interaction between SARS Unique virus."	0

A 46 year old West African man presented to our hospital's emergency room on March 15 th 2020 with severe acute kidney injury. He reported that two to three weeks prior to his hospital presentation he had had subjective fever, myalgias, sore throat and cough, which he had treated with multiple doses of ibuprofen. These complaints resolved one week prior to this hospital presentation, but he subsequently developed worsening abdominal pain, nausea and anorexia that persisted for the following week leading to his hospital presentation. He described lightheadedness when rising from a recumbent position. He reported decreased urine output but denied gross hematuria, frothy urine, or flank pain. He denied any new lower extremity edema or orthopnea, vomiting, diarrhea, change in mentation, persistent respiratory infectious symptoms, recent travel or sick contacts. Other than his recent use of ibuprofen he denied any other medication, vitamin supplementation, or herbal remedy. His medical history included obesity and obstructive sleep apnea for which he used nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Baseline serum creatinine was 1.1 mg/dl (eGFR by CKD EPI 93 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) on routine laboratory testing 16 months prior. He had no family history of kidney disease. He was born in Nigeria, worked as a nurse, lived with his wife and children in New York City, and did not use tobacco or illicit drugs.
On initial presentation, vital signs were notable for blood pressure 144/100 mmHg, heart rate 76 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and SpO2 94% breathing ambient air while lying flat in bed. BMI was 44 kg/m 2 . He had mild tenderness to palpation in the epigastrium and periumbilical region, and trace lower extremity edema; the remainder of the exam was unremarkable. Labs were notable for severe acute kidney injury (presenting serum creatinine 12.5 mg/dl) with nephrotic range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and elevated inflammatory markers. Initial laboratory assessment and selected trends are shown in the Table 1 . Imaging studies included a chest x ray showing mild pulmonary vascular congestion, a renal ultrasound with doppler showing a 14.3 cm right kidney and 14.1 cm left kidney with bilaterally increased echogenicity and normal arterial and venous doppler flow, a CT abdomen and pelvis without iodinated contrast showing mild hepatic steatosis and normal sized spleen, and a nuclear renal scan with DMSA showing equal perfusion to both kidneys without cortical defects.
The patient was initially treated with several liters of isotonic fluid, however his kidney function did not improve and he remained oliguric with orthopnea and persistent nausea. Therefore, a tunneled dialysis catheter was placed and he began intermittent hemodialysis on hospital day 4. Serologic screens were negative for HIV antibody, Hepatitis C antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody, anti nuclear antibody, anti DNA antibody, anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and cryoglobulin. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation were negative for monoclonal protein, and the kappa/lambda free light chain ratio was normal. The patient remained afebrile throughout his hospital course, and after several dialysis sessions his orthopnea improved and he was normoxemic breathing ambient air.

1951	"In December 2019, an initial cluster of unexpected interstitial bilateral pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province. A human to human transmission was immediately assumed and a previously unrecognized entity, termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID 19) due to a novel coronavirus (2019 nCov) was suddenly described. The infection has rapidly spread out all over the world and Italy has been the first European Country experiencing the endemic wave with unexpected clinical severity in comparison with Asian countries.
It has recently been shown that 2019 nCov utilizes host receptors namely angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as host receptor and host proteases for cell surface binding and internalization. Thus, a predisposing genetic background can give reason for interindividual disease susceptibility and/or severity. Taking advantage of the Network of Italian Genomes (NIG), here we mined around 7000 exomes from 5 different Centers looking for ACE2 variants. A number of variants with a potential impact on protein stability were identified. Among these, three missense changes, p.Asn720Asp, p.Lys26Arg, p.Gly211Arg (MAF 0.002 to 0.015), which have never been reported in the Eastern Asia population, were predicted to interfere with protein u and stabilization. Rare truncating variants likely interfering with the internalization process and one missense variant, p.Trp69Cys, predicted to interfere with 2019 nCov spike protein binding were also observed.
These findings suggest that a predisposing genetic background may contribute to the observed inter individual clinical variability associated with COVID 19. They allow an evidence based risk assessment opening up the way to personalized preventive measures and therapeutic options. All rights reserved.

The rapid increase in the overall Rt from day 12 (January 31, 2020) to day 19 (February 7, 2020) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger to passenger transmission, and this time period covers the time lag between February 1, 2020 when the index COVID 19 case was reported and February 5, 2020 when the Japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of COVID 19 positive cases (National Instatitute of Infectious Disease, 2020; Kumamotonichinichishinb, 2020).	1
1955	This research aims to show the positive and negative indirect effects of COVID 19 on the environment, particularly in the most affected countries such as China, USA, Italy, and Spain. Our research shows that there is secondary aspects such as the reduction in recycling and the increase in waste, further endangering the contamination of physical spaces (water and land), in addition to air. Global economic activity is expected to return in the coming months in most countries (even if slowly), so decreasing GHG concentrations during a short period is not a sustainable way to clean up our environment.	1
1956	As new cases of COVID 19 are being confirmed pressure is mounting to increase understanding of the factors underlying the spread the disease. Using data on local transmissions until the 23rd of March 2020, we develop an ensemble of 200 ecological niche models to project monthly variation in climate suitability for spread of SARS CoV 2 throughout a typical climatological year. Although cases of COVID 19 are reported all over the world, most outbreaks display a pattern of clustering in relatively cool and dry areas. The predecessor SARS CoV 1 was linked to similar climate conditions. Should the spread of SARS CoV 2 continue to follow current trends, asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks could be expected. According to the models, temperate warm and cold climates are more favorable to spread of the virus, whereas arid and tropical climates are less favorable. However, model uncertainties are still high across much of sub Saharan Africa, Latin America and South East Asia. While models of epidemic spread utilize human demography and mobility as predictors, climate can also help constrain the virus. This is because the environment can mediate human to human transmission of SARS CoV 2, and unsuitable climates can cause the virus to destabilize quickly, hence reducing its capacity to become epidemic.	0

Here we demonstrate that a class of widely used models is fundamentally flawed and cannot account for some important features of the viral spread. We suggest an integral equation based method that can be implemented in most of the reported models. Taking the example of COVID 19 data for New York City, we show that our model yields a significantly larger estimate for the initial basic reproduction rate unimproved model."	1

1960	Accurate forecasts of COVID 19 is central to resource management and building strategies to deal with the epidemic. We propose a heterogeneous infection rate model with human mobility for epidemic modeling, a preliminary version of which we have successfully used during DARPA Grand Challenge 2014. By linearizing the model and using weighted least squares, our model is able to quickly adapt to changing trends and provide extremely accurate predictions of confirmed cases at the level of countries and states of the United States. We show that during the earlier part of the epidemic, using travel data increases the predictions. Training the model to forecast also enables learning characteristics of the epidemic. In particular, we show that changes in model parameters over time can help us quantify how well a state or a country has responded to the epidemic. The variations in parameters also allow us to forecast different scenarios such suggestions.	0

1962	"In the current COVID 19 pandemic, much focus is put on 'flattening the curve'. This epidemiological 'curve' refers to the cases versus time graph, which shows the rise of a disease to its peak before descending. The aim in a pandemic is to flatten this curve by reducing the peak and spreading out the timeline. However, the models used to predict this curve are often not clearly outlined, no model parameters are given, and models are not tested against real data. This lack of detail makes it difficult to recreate the curve. What is much needed is a simple tool for approximating the curve to allow ideas to be tested and comparisons made.
This work presents a Simple Curve Approximation Tool (SCAT) which can be used by anyone. This tool allows the user to approximate and draw the curve and allows testing of assumptions, trajectories and the wildly varying figures reported in the media. The mathematics behind SCAT is clearly outlined here but understanding of this is not required. SCAT is provided online as a downloadable MS Excel workbook with some sample cases shown. Throughout this work, the parameters used are specified so that all results can be easily reproduced.
Although not intended as a prediction tool, SCAT has achieved less than 0.5 % error in short term forward prediction. It also shows a very significant improvement on the pandemic exponential approximations found throughout media reporting. As a comparison tool, it highlights obvious differences between COVID 19 and other diseases, such as influenza, and between countries at different stages of the pandemic (China, Italy and the UK are used here for demonstration purposes).
SCAT allows for quick approximation of the curve and creates meaningful comparisons and understandable visualisations for COVID 19 and other diseases."	0

Indeed, based on the data of April 10, 2020 with the numerical analysis, we are able to classify 15 states of US into the following four different categories for the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Today and the main conclusion are:
First, staring around April 14, 20202, three states which are Washington State, Louisiana and Indiana are entering the stage that the outbreak of COVID 19 is under the control, which means daily change of new patients is less than 10% and the gamma is less than zero in general.
Second, staring around April 15, 20202, two states which are New Jersey, and New York are entering the stage that the outbreak of COVID 19 is under the control, which means daily change of new patients is less than 10% and the gamma is less than zero in general.
Third, staring around April 16, 20202, seven states which are California, Florida, Georgia (GA), Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are entering the stage that the outbreak of COVID 19 is under the control, which means daily change of new patients is less than 10% and the gamma is less than zero in general.
Fourth, staring around April 17, 20202, three states which are Texas, Massachusetts, and Connecticut are entering the stage that the outbreak of COVID 19 is under the control, which means daily change of new patients is less than 10% and the gamma is less than zero in general.
Finally, we want to reinforce that emergency risk management is always associated with the implementation of an emergency plan. The identification of the Turning Time Period is key to emergency planning as it provides a timeline for effective actions and solutions to combat a pandemic by reducing as much unexpected risk as soon as possible."	0

1965	We conducted a comparative study of COVID 19 epidemic in three different settings: mainland China, the Guangdong province of China and South Korea, by formulating two disease transmission dynamics models incorporating epidemic characteristics and setting specific interventions, and fitting the models to multi source data to identify initial and effective reproduction numbers and evaluate effectiveness of interventions. We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8 th and 18 th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. We also project the epidemic trend in South Korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in China is used. We show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the COVID 19 epidemic in South Korea. The experience of outbreak control in mainland China should be Korea.	0

An increase in on farm mortality (euthanasia and death) in dairy herds has been reported in several countries in the last decade. This does not only imply possible problems with animal welfare, but it also causes economic losses to the farmer. The objective of this study was to evaluate time trends in on farm dairy cow mortality in Sweden and identify potential herd level risk factors. Data were retrieved on all Swedish dairy herds enrolled in the milk recording scheme between 2002 and 2010. Herds with a herd size of <20 cows or a mortality rate (MR) of >40 dead or euthanized cows per 100 cow years were excluded. Two different models were used: 1 multiple year analysis, which included 6,898 herds during the period 2002 to 2010 and 1 single year analysis including 4,252 herds for the year 2010, where other variables that were not present during the entire multiple year study were analyzed. The outcome variable was the number of euthanized and dead cows per year and season. A negative binomial regression model, adjusted for clustering within herd, was applied to both models. Fixed effects in the multiple year analysis were breed, calving interval, herd size, milk yield, region, season, pasture period, and year. The fixed effects in the single year analysis were breed, calving interval, conventional versus organic farming, herd size, housing system, milk yield, region, and season. The results demonstrated that MR gradually increased from 5.1 to 6.6 events per 100 cow years during the study period. Swedish MR are consequently on par with, or even greater than, MR among dairy herds in other comparable countries. Higher mortality was associated with larger herd size, longer calving intervals, and herds that had Swedish Holstein as the predominant breed. Lower mortality was observed in herds with a higher herd average milk yield, during the fall and winter, and in organically managed herds. There were regional differences in mortality. An interaction between herd size and season was found in both models. Also, an interaction between housing system and milk yield was found in the single year analysis. This first assessment of on farm mortality in Swedish dairy herds confirmed that the MR has increased over the last few years. The study also identified some herd level risk factors."	0

1973	 A laboratory based surveillance tool for SARS CoV 2 was established  It consists of minipool testing of nucleic acid preparations  Limit of detection was 48 copies per reaction (95% confidence interval: 33  184)  A protocol was distributed among five German university hospitals J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f  The approach proved its principle and one COVID 19 case was detected in 70 minipools Abstract: Background: A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2), emerged in China in late 2019 and subsequently caused a pandemic. Surveillance is important to better appreciate this evolving pandemic and to longitudinally monitor the effectiveness of public health measures. Objectives: We aimed to provide a rapid, easy to establish and costeffective laboratory based surveillance tool for SARS CoV 2. Study design: We used minipools of RNA prepared from nucleic acid extractions of routine respiratory samples. We technically validated the assay and distributed the protocol within an informal network of five German university laboratories. Results: We tested a total of 70 minipools resembling 700 samples shortly before the upsurge of cases in Germany from 17.02.2020 10.03.2020. One minipool reacted positive and after resolution one individual sample tested SARS COV 2 positive. This sample was from a hospitalized patient not suspected of having contracted SARS CoV 2. Conclusions: Our approach of a laboratory based surveillance for SARSCoV 2 using minipools proved its concept is easily adaptable and resource saving. It might assist not only public health laboratories in SARS CoV 2 surveillance. Investigation, Formal J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f	0
1974	The worldwide impact of COVID 19 continues to be felt as hospitals in all countries reduce elective and nonurgent cases to allow staffing and resources to be deployed elsewhere. Urgent gynaecological and cancer procedures are continuing, and it is imperative all theatre staff are protected and risks of SARS CoV 2 viral transmission reduced when operating on asymptomatic, suspected or confirmed COVID 19 patients. In particular, there are concerns relating to the transmission of COVID 19 during gynaecological laparoscopic surgery, arising from the potential generation of SARS CoV 2 contaminated aerosols from CO2 leakage and the creation of smoke from the use of energy devices. The aim of this paper is to review all the up to date evidence, including experiences from China and Italy, to guide the safe management of such patients when undergoing gynaecological procedures.	1
1975	It has been 2 months since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 was reported in Wuhan, China. So far, COVID 19 has affected 85 403 patients in 57 countries/territories and has caused 2924 deaths in 9 countries. However, epidemiological data differ between countries. Although China had higher morbidity and mortality than other sites, the number of new daily cases in China has been lower than outside of China since 26 February 2020. The incidence ranged from 61.44 per 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 people in the Republic of Korea to 0.0 0 02 per 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID 19 (cumulative cases/no. of days between the first reported case and 29 February 2020) was greatest in China (1320.85), followed by the Republic of Korea (78.78), Iran (43.11) and Italy (30.62). However, the DCIs in other countries/territories were < 10 per day. Several effective measures including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks, extensive investigation of COVID 19 spread, and once daily press conferences by the government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan. This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of 29 February 2020) with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which is much lower than that of nearby countries such as the Republic of Korea and Japan. In addition, the incidence and mortality were correlated with the DCI. However, further study and continued 19.	0
1976	"Background No specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19). Remdesivir (GS 5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS CoV 1, and SARS CoV 2 replication in animal models.
We did a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2 10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention to treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656.
Findings Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87 1·75]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95 2·43]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early.
Interpretation In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID 19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies."	0

1978	"The rapid spread of COVID 19 means that government and health services providers have little time to plan and design effective response policies. It is therefore important to rapidly provide accurate predictions of how vulnerable geographic regions such as counties are to the spread.
Objective: Developing county level prediction around near future disease movement for Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): We developed a 3 stage model to quantify, firstly the probability of COVID 19 occurrence for unaffected counties using XGBoost classifier and secondly, the number of potential occurrences of a county via XGBoost regression. Thirdly, these results are combined to compute the county level risk. This risk is then used as an estimated after five day vulnerability of the county.
Results: Using data from March 14 31, 2020, the model shows a sensitivity over 71.5% and specificity over 94%.
We found that population, population density, percentage of people aged 70 or greater and prevalence of comorbidities play an important role in predicting COVID 19 occurrences. We found a positive association between affected and urban counties as well as less vulnerable and rural counties. The developed model can be used for"	0
1979	After loading high risk individuals in an area, if a vehicle still has room, it can either go to another area to load more individuals or directly go back to the isolated region (some individuals in serious condition should be immediately sent to the hospital and are excluded from the individuals to be transferred).The objective of the problem is to reduce the risk of epidemic spread as much as possible, and hence the objective function should be defined based on the exposure durations of high risk individuals. For each area axi,j, the exposure duration of the first individual is τi,j, each next individual in the first round needs to wait another period of Δti,xi,j, and the exposure duration of each individual in subsequent rounds should take the travel time of vi between the area and the isolated region into consideration. This is because the solutions obtained by our algorithm have high qualities, i.e., they schedule the vehicles in an efficient and “compact” way; when a vehicle is delayed by an unexpected incident, many areas (especially those requiring multiple rounds of transfer) may be seriously affected, which can cause a significant increase of the total exposure time. For example, if the number of individuals in an area increases a small amount during the implementation of an existing solution, we typically make the vehicle for this area to transfer the new individuals and, if the vehicle is delayed too much, the last area(s) of the vehicle can be reassigned to other vehicle(s) that have completed their jobs.	1

1983	"Background and Objectives: While the number of detected COVID 19 infections are widely available, an understanding of the extent of undetected COVID 19 cases is urgently needed for an effective tackling of the pandemic and as a guide to lifting the lockdown. The aim of this work is to estimate and predict the true number of COVID 19 (detected and undetected) infections in India for short to medium forecast horizons. In particular, using publicly available COVID 19 infection data upto 16th April 2020, we predict the true number of infections in India during and upto the end of the formal lockdown period (21st April 2020).
Methods: The high death rate observed in most COVID 19 hit countries is suspected to be a function of the undetected infections existing in the population. An estimate of the age weighted infection fatality rate (IFR) of the disease of 0.41%, specifically calculated by taking into account the age structure of Indian population, is already available in the literature. In addition, the recorded case fatality rate (CFR= 0.70%) of Kerala, the only state in India to report single digit new infections over the second week of April, is used as a second estimate of the IFR. These estimates are used to formulate a relationship between deaths recorded and the true number of infections. The estimated undetected and detected cases time series based on these two IFR estimates are then used to fit a discrete time multivariate infection model to predict the total infections at the end of the formal lockdown period.
Results: In two consecutive fortnights during the lockdown, it was noted that the rise in detected infections has decreased by 2.7 times. For an IFR of 0.41%, the rise in undetected infections decreased by 3.2 times and the predicted number of total infections in India is 3.14 lakhs. While for an IFR of 0.70%, the rise in undetected cases decreased by 3.3 times and the total number of infections predicted on 21st April is 1.75 lakhs.
Interpretation and Conclusions: The behaviour of the undetected cases over time effectively illustrates the effects of lockdown and increased testing. From"	0

1985	"The pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has tremendous consequences for our societies. Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS CoV 2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and also to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. Blood donors comprise approximately 4.7% of the similarly aged population of Denmark and blood is donated in all areas of the country. The objective of this study was to perform real time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS CoV 2 infections and the population based IFR.
All Danish blood donors aged 17 69 years giving blood April 6 to 17 were tested for SARS CoV 2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between areas and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. The seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results: The first 9,496 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.7% (CI: 0.9 2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 82 per 100,000 (CI: 59 154) infections.
The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR, including only individuals with no comorbidity, is likely several fold lower than the current estimate. This may have implications for risk mitigation.
We have initiated real time nationwide anti SARS CoV 2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic."	0
1986	There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID19 that is causing a global pandemic. One current focus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic efficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID19 is essentially unknow. Without this understanding, it is challenging to discover a successful treatment to be approved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological processes of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS) that play crucial physiological roles in biosystems from plants to humans. It includes why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of H2O2, are required for protecting ROS induced injury in cell metabolism, why the amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant doses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced in the cell, and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in the innate immune defense. Here we propose a striking yet plausible amplification mechanism in the immune defense: ozone depleting like halogen cyclic reactions enhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological functions, which are activated by H2O2 and deactivated by NO signaling molecule. Our estimated results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands of times and amplify the RHS pathogen killing (defense) effects by 10 5 folds, resembling the cyclic O3 depleting reactions in the stratosphere. It is unraveled that H2O2 is a required protective signaling molecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can cause many diseases such as autoimmune disorders, multiple organ failure, aging and cancer. We also identify is also a signaling molecule of plant defense against pathogens 6 .	0
1987	"Human genes required for SARS CoV 2 entry into human cells, ACE2 and FURIN, were employed as baits to build genomics guided maps of up stream regulatory elements, their expression and functions in human body, including pathophysiologically relevant cell types. Genes acting as repressors and activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators (HMGA2; INSIG1) were then employed to identify existing drugs that could be repurposed to mitigate the coronavirus infection. Present analyses identify Vitamin D and Quercetin as promising pandemic mitigation agents. Gene expression profiles of Vitamin D and Quercetin activities and their established safety records as over the counter medicinal substances suggest that they may represent viable candidates for further assessment and considerations of their potential as coronavirus pandemic mitigation agents. Notably, gene set enrichment analyses and expression profiling experiments identify multiple drugs, most notably testosterone, dexamethasone, and doxorubicin, smoking, and many disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus infection promoting agents. Discordant patterns of Testosterone versus

1991	"The recent increase of immunopeptidomic data, obtained by mass spectrometry (MS) or binding assays, opens unprecedented possibilities for investigating endogenous antigen presentation by the highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA I) protein. We introduce a flexible and easily interpretable peptide presentation prediction method. We validate its performance as a predictor of cancer neoantigens and viral epitopes and use it to reconstruct peptide motifs presented on specific HLA I molecules.
Recognition of malignant and infected cells by the adaptive immune system requires binding of cytotoxic T cell receptors to antigens, 8 11 mer peptides presented by the Major Histocompatibilty Complex (MHC) class I coded by HLA I alleles (Fig. 1a) . Tumour specific neoantigens are currently sought after targets for improving cancer immunotherapy [1, 2]. Computational predictions can help select potential neoantigens and accelerate immunogenicity testing. To be useful, these predictions must be specific to each HLA type.
State of the art methods [3][4][5], such as NetMHC [6, 7], are based on artificial neural networks trained in a supervised way to predict peptide presentation from known peptide HLA association. They must be trained on large datasets, and perform best on common alleles. Their accuracy is degraded for rare or little studied HLA I alleles which are poorly represented in databases. In that case, another approach is to train unsupervised models of presentation from custom elution experiments with little or no information about peptide HLA association. For instance, MixMHCp [8, 9] can reconstruct, from unannotated peptide sequences, a mixture of generative models  one for each expressed HLA type. However, it makes simplifying assumptions about binding specificity, and is not designed to leverage available (albeit limited) annotation information from the Immune Epitope Database [10] (IEDB) to improve accuracy.
We present an alternative method for predicting peptides presented by specific HLA types, which can be trained on custom datasets. It can be applied to patient or experiment specific samples and treats common and rare alleles on equal footing, avoiding potential database biases. We use a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), an unsupervised machine learning scheme that learns probability distributions of sequences given as input [11] [12] [13] . The RBM estimates presentation scores for each peptide, and can generate candidate presentable peptides. It also provides a lower dimensional representation of peptides with a clear interpretation in terms of associated HLA type, which can be exploited to train classifiers of HLA association from a small number of HLA annotations. The RBM has a simple structure with one hidden layer and weights connecting the input  the peptide sequence  to the hidden layer. The weights, along with the biases acting on both input and hidden units, are learned from a list of presented peptides (see Methods, Fig. 1b, Supplementary Figs. 1, 2, 3) . The RBM probability is interpreted as a probabilistic score of antigen presentation by any of the 6 HLA I in the experiment. We applied standard alignment routines to reduce sequences to the most common length of 9 residues (see Methods).
As a first validity check, we built an RBM model to predict presentation by a single common allele, HLA A*02:01, from MS data annotated with this HLA restriction in IEDB. We tested the model's ability to discriminate presented peptides from ""generic"" peptides (randomly drawn from the human proteome). We calculated a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve from RBM presentation scores assigned to a test set of presented versus generic peptides (Fig. 1c) . The Area Under the Curve of the receiving operating characteristic, AUC = 0.973, proves the RBM predictive power at recovering presented antigens. To further probe the applications of RBM to neoantigen discovery, we considered the missense mutations in 5 ovarian and melanoma cancer cell lines, filtered by expression levels and by the NetMHC predicted affinity to HLA*A:02:01 [14] . We attributed RBM presentation scores to all 8 11 mer peptides harbouring these mutations. RBM performed comparably to , the state of the art method for antigen prediction: 15 out of 16 neoantigens that were MS validated as HLA I bound are ranked by the RBM in the (which was not certified by peer review)"	0

1997	With respect to the asymptomatic transmission characteristics of the novel coronavirus that appeared in 2019 (COVID 19), a susceptible asymptomatic infected recovered death (SAIRD) model that considered human mobility was constructed in this study. The dissemination of COVID 19 was simulated using computational experiments to identify the mechanisms underlying the impact of city and residential lockdowns on controlling the spread of the epidemic. Results: The implementation of measures to lock down cities led to higher mortality rates in these cities, due to reduced mobility. Moreover, implementing city lockdown along with addition of hospital beds led to improved cure and reduced mortality rates. Stringent implementation and early lockdown of residential units effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, and reduced the number of hospital bed requirements. Collectively, measures to lock down cities and residential units should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID 19. In addition, medical resources should be increased in cities under lockdown. Implementation of these measures would reduce the spread of the virus to other cities and allow appropriate treatment of patients in cities under lockdown.	0
1998	In a recent paper [1], Singh and Adhikari present results of an analysis of a mathematical model of epidemiology based on which they argue that a 49 day lockdown is required in India for containing the pandemic in India. We assert that as a model study with the stated assumptions, the analysis presented in the paper is perfectly valid, however, any serious comparison with real data and attempts at prediction from the model are highly problematic. The main point of the present paper is to convincingly establish this assertion while providing a warning that the results and analysis of such mathematical models should not be taken at face value and need to be used with great caution by policy makers.	0
1999	one of the most common diseases in human worldwide, while those caused by emerging viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, 2019 nCoV that caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China most recently, have posed great threats to global public health. Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories. With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus. Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described. It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections.

The combined parameter NLR&RDW SD had the best diagnostic efficiency (AUC was 0.938) and
when the cut off value was 1.046, the sensitivity and the specificity were 90.0% and 84.7% respectively, followed by the fitting parameter NLR&RDW CV (AUC = 0.923). When the cut off value was 0.62, the sensitivity and the specificity for distinguishing severe type from moderate cases of COVID 19 were 90.0% and 82.4% respectively.
The combined parameter NLR&RDW SD is the best hematology index and can help clinicians to predict the severity of COVID 19 patients, and it can be used as a useful indicator to help prevent and control the epidemic."	0

2003	Alarms periodically emerge for viral pneumonia infections due to coronavirus. In all cases, these are zoonoses passing the barrier between species and infect humans. The legitimate concern of the international community is due to the fact that the new identified coronavirus, named SARS CoV 2 (previously called 2019 nCoV), has a quite high mortality rate, around 2% , and a strong ability to spread, with an estimated reproduction number higher than 2. Even though all countries are doing their utmost to stop the pandemic, the only reliable solution to tackle the infection is the rapid development of a vaccine. For this purpose, the means of bioinformatics, applied in the context of reverse vaccinology paradigm, can be of fundamental help to select the most promising peptides able to trigger an effective immune response. In this short report, using the concept of nullomer and introducing a distance from human self, we provide a list of peptides that could deserve experimental investigation in the view of a potential vaccine for SARS CoV 2.	1

An 18 month old, 1.24 kg male castrated ferret was presented to the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital (Urbana, IL USA) for a 4 week history of lethargy, inappetance, possible straining to urinate/defecate, and swelling with erythema of the gingiva adjacent to the left maxillary canine. A leukocytosis and hyperglobulinemia were also noted by the referring veterinarian 1 week before presentation.
The patient was quiet, inquisitive, and alert on initial presentation, but became notably depressed soon thereafter. Body condition score was an estimated 3 out of 5. The patient was painful on manipulation of the mouth, likely because of the gingival swelling and erythema. Thoracic auscultation revealed a sinus arrhythmia and mild end inspiratory wheeze with possible mild expiratory effort. Temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were 98.6°F, 250 beats/min, and 42 breaths/min, respectively. Abdominal palpation revealed an enlarged spleen and pain on caudal abdominal manipulation. No other abnormalities were detected on physical examination. Based on the history and physical examination findings, the ferret was admitted for additional diagnostic testing and therapy.
The ferret was anesthetized via facemask with 5% isoflurane (Iso Flo; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL USA) and oxygen (1 L/min). Once the animal was induced, it was maintained at 1.5% isoflurane and 1 L/min oxygen.

2007	Official counts of COVID 19 deaths have been criticized for potentially including people who did not die of COVID 19 but merely died with COVID 19. I address that potential problem by fitting a generalized additive model to past weekly provisional counts of all registered deaths in England and Wales. The model provides baseline estimates of the number of death registrations expected in the absence of the COVID 19 pandemic, and comparing the baselines to actual counts of recently registered deaths reveals the emergence of excess deaths late in March 2020. I estimate that, among people aged 45 , 610 ± 405 excess deaths were registered from 21 March through 27 March, 5689 ± 420 excess deaths from 28 March through 3 April, and 9374 ± 470 excess deaths from 4 10 April. Those estimates are larger than the ONS's respective counts of 531, 3432, and 6139 COVID 19 associated deaths, implying that the ONS's counts underestimate rather than overestimate the true death toll. The Department of Health and Social Care's counts of in hospital COVID 19 associated deaths over the same period are even less, indicating that they are more severe undercounts. If underreporting rates have held steady, about 32,000 reported.	0

2009	"We are currently in the middle of a global crisis. Covid19 pandemic has suddenly threatened the existence of human life. Till date, as no medicine or vaccine is discovered, the this pandemic is prevention. The impact of different environmental, social, economic and health parameters is unknown and under research. It is important to identify the factors which can weaken the virus, and the nations which are more vulnerable to this virus.
Data of weather, vaccination trends, life expectancy, lung disease, number of infected people in the pre lockdown and post lockdown period of highly infected nations are collected. These are extracted from authentic online resources and published reports. Analysis is done to find the possible impact of each parameter on CoVid19.
CoVid19 has no linear correlation with any of the selected parameters, though few parameters have depicted non linear relationship in the graphs. Further investigations have shown better result for some parameters. A combination of the parameters results in a better correlation with infection rate.
Though depending on the study outcome, the impact of CoVid19 in India can be predicted, the required lockdown period cannot be calculated due to data limitation."	1
2010	"Backgrounds: Up to February 16, 2020, 355 cases have been confirmed as having COVID 19 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship. Method: We fitted the reported serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied ""earlyR"" package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID 19 outbreak. We applied ""projections"" package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Results: The Maximum Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID 19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06 2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384 1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981 1177) and 758 (697 817), respectively. Conclusion: The median with 95% CI of R0 of COVID 19 was about 2.28 (2.06 2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0. Unless strict infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential of COVID 19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship."	0
2011	"N95 masks form a critical part of the personal protective equipment used by frontline health care workers, and are typically meant for one time usage. However, the recent COVID pandemic has resulted in a serious shortage of these masks leading to a worldwide effort to develop decontamination and re use procedures. A major factor contributing to the filtration efficiency of N95 masks is the presence of an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene electret fibers that trap particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects. This charge degrades quickly when the mask is used. Moreover, simple decontamination procedures (e.g. use of alcohol) immediately degrade any remaining charge from the polypropylene, thus severely impacting the filtration efficiency post decontamination. In this brief report, we summarize preliminary results on the development of a simple laboratory setup allowing measurement of charge and filtration efficiency in N95 masks. We show how the charge on the mask changes due to decontamination treatments, and correlate with reduced filtration efficiency. Additionally, we propose and show that it is possible to recharge the masks post decontamination treatment and recover filtration efficiency. Importantly, recharging can be performed using readily available equipment and materials, and so can be employed both in urban and rural settings.
We emphasize that because of the current worldwide lockdown, the measurements reported in this report are preliminary, performed with hastily constructed home built equipment on a small variety of masks available to us. Although we are confident in our results, we encourage groups with special purpose equipment to redo and verify our experiments."	0

Hospital of Wuhan, China. Clinical features, chronic comorbidities, demographic data, and laboratory and radiological data were reviewed. The outcomes of patients with severe pneumonia and those with non severe pneumonia were compared using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) to explore clinical characteristics and risk factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to screen optimal predictors from the risk factors and the predictive power was verified by internal validation.
: A total of 377 patients diagnosed with COVID 19 were enrolled in this study, including 117 with severe pneumonia and 260 with non severe pneumonia. The independent risk factors for severe pneumonia were age [odds ratio (OR): 1.059, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.036 1.082; p < 0.001], N/L (OR: 1.322, 95% CI: 1.180 1.481; p < 0.001), CRP (OR: 1.231, 95% CI: 1.129 1.341; p = 0.002), and D dimer (OR: 1.059, 95% CI: 1.013 1.107; p = 0.011). We identified a product of N/L*CRP*D dimer as having an important predictive value for the severity of COVID 19. The cutoff value was 5.32. The negative predictive value of less than 5.32 for the N/L*CRP*D dimer was 93.75%, while the positive predictive value was 46.03% in the test sets. The sensitivity and specificity were 89.47% and 67.42%. In the training sets, the negative and positive predictive values were 93.80% and 41.32%, respectively, with a specificity of 70.76% and a sensitivity of 89.87%.

2018	Recently newer synthetic DNA vaccines have been rapidly advanced to clinical study and have demonstrated an impressive degree of immune potency and tolerability. Improvements in DNA delivery over prior needle and syringe approaches include jet delivery, gene gun delivery, among others. Among the most effective of these new delivery methods, advanced electroporation (EP), combined with other advances, induces robust humoral and cellular immunity in both preventative as well as therapeutic studies. Advancements in leader sequence changes, RNA and codon optimizations, improved insert designs, increased concentrations of DNA, and skin delivery, appear to complement newer delivery strategies. These advances also provide a framework for the in vivo production of synthetic DNA biologics. In this review, we focus on recent studies of synthetic DNA vaccines in the clinic for the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases with a focus on adaptive electroporation for delivery, and briefly summarize novel preclinical data advancing the in vivo delivery of DNAencoded antibody like biologics.	1
2019	On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019, COVID 19, a global pandemic. In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID 19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in n = 30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56±0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47±0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82±2.95 days. We postulate that the latent and infectious periods are disease specific, whereas the contact period is behavior specific and can vary between different provinces, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n = 50 states, we adopted the disease specific values from China, and found a contact period of 3.38±0.69 days. Our network model predicts that without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today the United states would have faced a outbreak	0

2021	The emergence of COVID 19 has severely compromised the arsenal of antiviral and antibiotic drugs. Drug discovery is a multistep process with a high failure rate, high cost and it takes approximately 10 12 years for the development of new molecules into the clinical candidate. On the other side, drug repurposing also called old drugs for new uses, is an attractive alternative approach for a new application of marketed FDA approved or investigational drugs. In the current pandemic situation raised due to COVID 19, repurposing of existing FDA approved drugs are emerging as the first line of the treatment. The causative viral agent of this highly contagious disease and acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus identify the combination therapy targeting various stages of the viral life cycle.	0

Nowadays, this also includes digital innovations ranging from complex epidemiological models, artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, to open data platforms for prevention, diagnostic and treatment.
Amongst the many challenges during a pandemic, innovation stakeholders and manufacturing firms particularly find themselves suddenly engaged in new relationships, possibly even with firms that have been competitors prior to the pandemic. Those stakeholders are thus likely to face intellectual property (IP) related challenges. Unfortunately, to (governmental) decision makers these challenges might not appear to be of paramount urgency compared to the many, huge operational challenges to deploy urgently needed resources. However, if IP challenges are considered too late, they may cause delays to urgently mobilising resources effectively. Manufacturing firms could be reluctant to fully engage in the development and mass manufacturing of Crisis Critical Products.
Its purpose is to provide a structure for those concerned with steering clear of IP challenges to avoid delays in fighting a pandemic.
From an ad hoc patent analysis we identify that the majority of coronavirus related patents in the field are around organic chemistry, and development of methodologies and drugs for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of viruses. We also identify a time lag between the outbreak and the materialisation of patent applications, which is consistent with the processes of the Patent Office. The large number of references to non patent literature published after outbreaks is also an indication of the urgency of scientists to put the information in the public domain and make them accessible quickly to a wider audience."	0

2029	The respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from 2 China and caused more than 1000 death globally since December 2019. This new virus, 3 called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensin 4 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe 5 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 6 through the spike proteins (S protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S protein 7 from the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019 nCoV. 8 However, function of a bio system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, 9 control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed 10 between ACE2 and the S protein from 2019 nCoV, so that the rate of their association 11 can be estimated and compared with the binding of S protein from SARS CoV by a 12 multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new 13 virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data 14 obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between 15 virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in 16 host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that 17 the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, 18 while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our 19 computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible 20 explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS. 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 author/funder.

2030	Rapidly responding to novel pathogens, such as SARS CoV 2, represents an extremely challenging and complex endeavor. Numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research efforts to mitigate the catastrophic effects of COVID 19 pandemic are underway, yet an efficacious countermeasure is still not available. To support these global research efforts, we have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning, bioinformatics, and supercomputing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the SARS CoV 2 receptor binding domain (RBD). In 22 days, using just the SARS CoV 2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for SARS CoV 1, we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS CoV 2 RBD. As a first step in this process, we predicted (and publicly released) structures of the SARS CoV 2 spike protein using homology based structural modeling. The predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. Next we used our in silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to SARS CoV 1 neutralizing antibodies (known not to bind SARS Cov 2) to enable and optimize binding within the RBD of SARS CoV 2. Starting from a calculated baseline free energy of  48.1 kcal/mol (± 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS CoV 2 RBD with free energies as low as  82.0 kcal/mole. The baseline SARS CoV 1 antibody in complex with the SARS CoV 1 RBD has a calculated interaction energy of  52.2 kcal/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS CoV 2 RBD and potentially neutralize the virus. Additionally, that are low probability under a mutational probability distribution derived from the	0

SARS CoV 2 is the name of the virus responsible for causing COVID 19 disease, which is highly infectious and lethal.With exponentially increasing infections, proportionate fatalities are being reported both from developed and under developed countries. As of today, more than one million people across the world have been reported infected with this virus, and more than 65,000 people have died of this disease. Hence, there is an urgent requirement for conducting academic research on several aspects of this highly contagious disease, to find effective means of containment and treatment of the disease, for now, and in future.

2036	Background: Community acquired viruses (CRVs) may cause severe disease in cancer patients. Thus, efforts should be made to diagnose CRV rapidly and manage CRV infections accordingly. Methods: A panel of 18 clinicians from the Infectious Diseases Working Party of the German Society for Haematology and Medical Oncology have convened to assess the available literature and provide recommendations on the management of CRV infections including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus. Results: CRV infections in cancer patients may lead to pneumonia in approximately 30% of the cases, with an associated mortality of around 25%. For diagnosis of a CRV infection, combined nasal/throat swabs or washes/aspirates give the best results and nucleic acid amplification based techniques (NAT) should be used to detect the pathogen. Hand hygiene, contact isolation and face masks have been shown to be of benefit as general infection management. Causal treatment can be given for influenza, using a neuraminidase inhibitor, and respiratory syncytial virus, using ribavirin in addition to intravenous immunoglobulins. Ribavirin has also been used to treat parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus, but data are inconclusive in this setting. Cidofovir is used to treat adenovirus pneumonitis.

Presently, nucleic acid amplification test is essential for the confirmation of COVID infection. In this report, we summarized the six promising methods, including whole genome sequencing, real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, nanopore target sequencing, antibody based immunoassay techniques, use of paper based biomolecular sensors, and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats Cas system based technology, which can also be deployed for the detection of SARS CoV 2. We further introduced the principles of these methods, discussed the scope and practicability of application of the available products and methods, and highlighted the potential approaches to develop additional products and techniques for early diagnosis of COVID 19.	0

2039	Initial epidemiological investigations have indicated the Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan as a geographically linked source, but subsequent detailed epidemiological assessment has revealed that up to 45% of the early cases with symptom onset before 1 January 2020 were not linked to this market (5, 11). To investigate whether the COVID 19 RdRp/Hel assay was specific for SARS CoV 2 in clinical specimens, we used the assay to test 22 archived nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs and throat swabs that were positive for other respiratory pathogens by FilmArray RP2 from 22 patients with upper and/or lower respiratory tract symptoms. The use of the highly sensitive COVID 19 RdRp/Hel assay to test saliva specimens from suspected cases of COVID 19 might be a simple and rapid way to avoid the need of aerosol generating procedures during collection of nasopharyngeal aspirates and suction of sputum, especially in regions most heavily affected by the ongoing COVID 19 (13).	0

Human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is most closely 2 related, by average genetic distance, to two coronaviruses isolated from bats, RaTG13 and 3 RmYN02. However, there is a segment of high amino acid similarity between human SARS 4
CoV 2 and a pangolin isolated strain, GD410721, in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of 5 the spike protein, a pattern that can be caused by either recombination or by convergent 6 amino acid evolution driven by natural selection. We perform a detailed analysis of the 7 synonymous divergence, which is less likely to be affected by selection than amino acid 8 divergence, between human SARS CoV 2 and related strains. We show that the 9 synonymous divergence between the bat derived viruses and SARS CoV 2 is larger than 10 between GD410721 and SARS CoV 2 in the RBD, providing strong additional support for 11 the recombination hypothesis. However, the synonymous divergence between pangolin 12 strain and SARS CoV 2 is also relatively high, which is not consistent with a recent 13 recombination between them, instead it suggests a recombination into RaTG13. We also 14 find a 14 fold increase in the d N /d S ratio from the lineage leading to SARS CoV 2 to the 15 strains of the current pandemic, suggesting that the vast majority of non synonymous 16 mutations currently segregating within the human strains have a negative impact on viral 17 fitness. Finally, we estimate that the time to the most recent common ancestor of SARS 18
CoV 2 and RaTG13 or RmYN02 based on synonymous divergence, is 51.71 years (95% 19 a coronavirus (Lu, et al. 2020; Zhang and Holmes 2020), Severe acute respiratory syndrome 1 coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2), an RNA virus with a 29,891 bp genome consisting of four major 2 structural genes (Wu, et al. 2020; Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020). Of particular relevance to this study 3 is the spike protein which is responsible for binding to the primary receptor for the virus, 4 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Wan, et al. 2020; Wu, et al. 2020; Zhou, Yang, et al. 5 2020). 6
Human SARS CoV 2 is related to a coronavirus (RaTG13) isolated from the bat 7
Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan province of China (Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020). RaTG13 and the 8 human strain reference sequence (Genbank accession number MN996532) are 96.2% identical 9
and it was first argued that, throughout the genome, RaTG13 is the closest relative to human 10 SARS CoV 2 (Zhou, et al. 2020 showed that RaTG13 and SARS CoV 2 11 were 91.02% and 90.55% identical ,respectively, to coronaviruses isolated from pangolins 12 (Pangolin CoV), which therefore form a close outgroup to the SARS CoV 2 RaTG13 clade . 13 Furthermore, five key amino acids in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike were identical 14 between SARS CoV 2 and Pangolin CoV, but differed between those two strains and RaTG13. 15 (Lam, et al. 2020) independently made similar observations and additionally showed that when 16 analyzing a window of length 582bp in the RBD, nonsynonymous mutations support a 17 phylogenetic tree with SARS CoV 2 and Pangolin CoV as sister groups, while synonymous 18 mutations do not. They discuss two possible explanations for their results, one which includes 19 recombination and another which includes selection driven convergent evolution. Boni, et al. 20 2020 found little evidence of recombination between SARS CoV 2 and Pangolin CoV using the 21 recombination analysis software 3SEQ (Lam, et al. 2018), but argued that if there has been 22 recombination, it likely occurred into RaTG13 from an unknown divergent source. This would 23 explain the amino acid similarity between SARS CoV 2 and Pangolin CoV in the RBD as an 24
ancestral trait that has been lost (by recombination) in RaTG13. Using a phylogenetic analysis 25 they also dated the RaTG13 and SARS CoV 2 divergence to be between 40 to 70 years. 26"	0

2043	"The urgent need for massively scaled clinical or surveillance testing for SARS CoV 2 has necessitated a reconsideration of the methods by which respiratory samples are collected, transported, processed and tested. Conventional testing for SARS CoV 2 involves collection of a clinical specimen with a nasopharyngeal swab, storage of the swab during transport in universal transport medium (UTM), extraction of RNA, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT qPCR). As testing has scaled across the world, supply chain challenges have emerged across this entire workflow. Here we sought to evaluate how eliminating the UTM storage and RNA extraction steps would impact the results of molecular testing. Using paired mid turbinate swabs self collected by 11 individuals with previously established SARS CoV 2 positivity, we performed a comparison of conventional (swab → UTM → RNA extraction → RT qPCR) vs. simplified (direct elution from dry swab → RT qPCR) protocols. Our results suggest that dry swabs eluted directly into a simple buffered solution (TE) can support molecular detection of SARS CoV 2 via endpoint RT qPCR without substantially compromising sensitivity. Although further confirmation with a larger sample size and variation of other parameters is necessary, these results are encouraging for the possibility of a simplified workflow that could support massively scaled testing for COVID 19 control.
Based on prior literature ( 1 , 2 ) and the fact that dry swabs are employed for SARS CoV 2 testing outside of the United States , we know that swabs collected and transported without transport media are amenable to subsequent nucleic acid detection based diagnostics. We hypothesized that elution of dry swabs directly into a Tris EDTA (TE) buffer would be compatible with RT qPCR, i.e. skipping conventional RNA extraction altogether. TE's lower salt 1 .

2045	Background: Rapid and reliable diagnostic assays were critical for prevention and control of the coronavirus pneumonia caused by COVID 19. Objective: This study was to establish one pot real time reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT LAMP) assay and one pot visual RT LAMP assay for the detection of COVID 19. Methods: Six specific LAMP primers targeting the N gene of COVID 19 were designed, the RT LAMP reaction system was optimized with plasmid pUC57 containing N gene sequence, the detection limit was determined with a serial dilution of the plasmid pUC57 containing N gene sequence, and the one pot real time RT LAMP assay and one pot visual RT LAMP assay for the detection of COVID 19 were established. Results: Our results showed that the one pot RT LAMP assays can detect COVID 19 with a limit of ≥ 6 copies per μl −1 of pUC57 containing N gene sequence. Conclusion: This study provides rapid, reliable and sensitive tools 19.	0
2046	In Cyprus, the existing political structure prior to the implementation of the new GHS was made up of 11 ministries separated into different departments providing specific services within the Cypriot Government [2] with the Ministry of Health (MoH) being responsible for the health care system of the island. Perhaps, the operating directorates under SHSO can closely collaborate with the relevant funding bodies and research organisations on the island for the set up of research programs or clinical studies such as using collected data from patient cohorts to inform the better management conditions. Therefore, we are optimistic that the CQII will be favoured by all political parties, patient associations, providers, professional associations, private and public health insurance organisations and the Ministry of Health to support the New Cyprus National Health Service bill currently being in effect [21].	1

2048	Background. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) targeting select genes of the SARS CoV 2 RNA has been the main diagnostic tool in the global response to the COVID 19 pandemic. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the test has not been studied systematically outside of the laboratory setting. The aim of this study is to provide estimates of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the RT PCR test developed by China CDC. Methods. The study design is a secondary analysis of published findings on 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, of whom 601 tested positive and 413 were negative for COVID 19. Sensitivity and specificity were reconstructed using a Bayesian approach from probabilistic knowledge of the diagnostic errors. Predictive values of the test were calculated, resulting in estimates for the number of confirmatory tests that are needed for establishing the presence or absence of COVID 19, depending on the prior probability of a patient having the disease. Results. The sensitivity of the RT PCR diagnostic test was estimated to be 0.777 (95% CI: 0.715, 0.849), while the specificity was 0.988 (95% CI: 0.933, 1.000). The confidence intervals include sampling error in addition to the error due to probabilistic knowledge of the data. Discussion. The Chinese version of the RT PCR test had a conspicuous rate of false negative results, likely missing between 15% and 29% of patients with COVID 19. For a patient with a	0

2051	The SARS CoV 2 pandemic has caused a severe, international shortage of N95 2 respirators, which are essential to protect healthcare providers from infection. Given the 3 contemporary limitations of the supply chain, it is imperative to identify effective means 4 of decontaminating, reusing, and thereby conserving N95 respirator stockpiles. To be 5 effective, decontamination must result in sterilization of the N95 respirator without 6 impairment of respirator filtration or user fit. Although numerous methods of N95 7 decontamination exist, none are universally accessible. In this work we describe a 8 microwave generated steam decontamination protocol for N95 respirators for use in 9 healthcare systems of all sizes, geographies, and means. Using widely available glass 10 containers, mesh from commercial produce bags, a rubber band, and a 1100W 11 commercially available microwave, we constructed an effective, standardized, and 12 reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators. Employing this methodology 13 against MS2 phage, a highly conservative surrogate for SARS CoV 2 contamination, we 14 report an average 6 log 10 plaque forming unit (PFU) (99.9999%) and a minimum 5 log 10 15 PFU (99.999%) reduction after a single three minute microwave treatment. Notably, 16 quantified respirator fit and function were preserved, even after 20 sequential cycles of 17 microwave steam decontamination. This method provides a valuable means of effective 18 decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators by frontline providers facing urgent need. 19 	0

2053	"The COVID 19 pandemic has created a high demand on personal protective equipment, including disposable N95 masks. Given the need for mask reuse, we tested the feasibility of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet light (UV), and ethanol decontamination strategies on N95 mask integrity and the ability to remove the infectious potential of SARS CoV 2. FIT test data showed functional degradation by both ethanol and UV decontamination to different degrees. VHP treated masks showed no significant change in function after two treatments. We also report a single SARS CoV 2 virucidal experiment using Vero E6 cell infection. We hope our data will guide further research for evidenced based decisions for disposable N95 mask reuse and help protect caregivers from SARS CoV 2 and other pathogens.

2054	The coronavirus disease 2019 is raging across the world. The radiomics, which explores huge amounts of features from medical image for disease diagnosis, may help the screen of the COVID 19. In this study, we aim to develop a radiomic signature to screen COVID 19 from CT images. We retrospectively collect 75 pneumonia patients from Beijing Youan Hospital, including 46 patients with COVID 19 and 29 other types of pneumonias. These patients are divided into training set (n = 50) and test set (n = 25) at random. We segment the lung lesions from the CT images, and extract 77 radiomic features from the lesions. Then unsupervised consensus clustering and multiple cross validation are utilized to select the key features that are associated with the COVID 19. In the experiments, while twenty three radiomic features are found to be highly associated with COVID 19, four key features are screened and used as the inputs of support vector machine to build the radiomic signature. We use area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curve to assess the performance of our model. It yields AUCs of 0.862 and 0.826 in the training set and the test set respectively. We also perform the stratified analysis and find that its predictive ability is not affected by gender, age, chronic disease and degree of severity. In conclusion, we investigate the value of radiomics in screening COVID 19, and the experimental results suggest the radiomic signature could be a potential tool for diagnosis of COVID 19.	0
2055	The coronavirus disease 2019 has grown up to be a pandemic within a short span of time. To investigate transmission dynamics and then determine control methodology, we took epidemic in Wuhan as a study case. Unfortunately, to our best knowledge, the existing models are based on the common assumption occurred both in the community and in hospital due to the difference in the contact rate. To solve this problem, we propose a novel epidemic model called SEIR HC, which is a novel epidemic model with two different social circles. Using the model alongside the exclusive optimization algorithm, the spread process of COVID 19 epidemic in Wuhan city is reproduced and then the propagation characteristics and unknown data are estimated. Furthermore, the control measures implemented in Wuhan are assessed and the control methodology of COVID 19 is discussed to provide guidance for limiting the epidemic spread.	1
2056	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) has quickly grown from a regional outbreak in Wuhan, China to a global pandemic. Early estimates of the epidemic growth and incubation period of COVID 19 may have been severely biased due to sample selection. Using detailed case reports from 14 locations in and outside mainland China, we obtained 378 Wuhan exported cases who left Wuhan before an abrupt travel quarantine. We developed a generative model we call BETS for four key epidemiological events Beginning of exposure, End of exposure, time of Transmission, and time of Symptom onset (BETS) and derived explicit formulas to correct for the sample selection. We gave a detailed illustration of why some early and highly influential analyses of the COVID 19 pandemic were severely biased. All our analyses, regardless of which subsample and model were being used, point to an epidemic doubling time of 2 to 2.5 days during the early outbreak in Wuhan. A Bayesian nonparametric analysis further suggests that 5% of the symptomatic cases may not develop symptoms within 14 days since infection. * Correspondence to: qyzhao@statslab.cam.ac.uk.	0
2057	Motivated with various responses of world governments to COVID 19, here we develop a toy model of the dependence epidemics spreading on the availability of tests for disease. Our model, that we call SUDR K, is based on usual SIR model, but it splits the total fraction of infected individuals into two components: those that are undetected and those that are detected through tests. Moreover, we assume that available tests increase at a constant rate from the beginning of epidemics but are consumed to detect infected individuals. Strikingly we find a bi stable behavior between a phase with a giant fraction of infected and a phase with a very small fraction. We show that the separation between these two regimes is governed by a match between the rate of testing and a rate of infection spread at given time. We also show that the existence of two phases does not depend on the mathematical choice of the form of the term describing the rate at which undetected individuals are tested and detected. Presented research implies that a vigorous early testing activity, before the epidemics enters into its giant phase, can potentially keep epidemics under control, and that even a very small change in rate of testing can increase or decrease the size of the whole epidemics of various orders of magnitude. For the real application of realistic model to ongoing epidemics, we would gladly collaborate process.	0
2058	With the dramatic background of a newly emerged virus (SARS CoV 2) spreading around the world, Coronavirus and other infectious health threats for the human and animal populations were illustrated and debated in excellent presentations at the IABS meeting 26 28 of February 2020. Historical evidence of pandemics and lessons learned from recent epidemics or epizootics caused by many pathogens (e.g., Ebola, Zika, and African Swine Fever viruses) illustrated the overarching need for close international cooperation. New and old technologies in vaccine development and their use were presented, resulting in a call for greater interaction between the human and the veterinary fields in order to and knowledge in both human and animal medicine. The One Health concept was also emphasized for eliminating the 59,000 fatal human rabies cases annually attributed to unvaccinated dogs. For preventable, infectious diseases commonly spreading in the poorer regions of the world, a new regulatory approach and governance structure was called for to give access to affordable vaccines. Vaccines were touted as one of the most successful health invention ever introduced; on a similar level to health improvements due to clean water.	1

Expérience d'une collaboration épidémioclinique en situation d'alerte sanitaire liée à une infection émergente ☆ Management of 90 patients presenting with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome. Experience of a collaboration between epidemiologists and clinicians facing an emerging infectious disease health alert Reçu le 31 août 2005 ; accepté le 28 septembre 2007 Disponible sur internet le 07 novembre 2007
Objectifs.  Afin d'analyser les différences possibles d'évaluation entre les équipes opérationnelles épidémiologiques et cliniciennes dans la gestion d'une maladie épidémique émergente, et d'en tirer un enseignement pour la gestion de crises ultérieures, les caractéristiques des patients suspects de syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère (SRAS) hospitalisés dans un service parisien ont été décrites.
Patients et méthodes.  Les 90 patients hospitalisés du 16 mars au 30 avril 2003 furent inclus dans cette étude prospective. Les données échangées avec les institutions sanitaires locales permirent à la fois une classification de cas officielle (« possibles », « probables », « exclus ») et une classification locale basée sur une adaptation de celle ci, incluant une catégorie supplémentaire dans la graduation du risque, intermédiaire entre « possible » et « exclu » (« douteux »).
Résultats.  L'évaluation initiale différait dans 39 % des cas (n = 35), sur des arguments épidémiologiques (n = 24) ou clinicobiologiques (n = 11). L'évaluation finale divergeait dans 54 % des cas (n = 47). Tous les patients furent officiellement considérés comme des cas « exclus » de SRAS, alors que 47 demeuraient des cas « possibles » ou « douteux » selon les cliniciens.
Conclusion.  Une différence de perception existait dans environ 40 % des cas, sans impact en termes de diffusion épidémique ou d'exposition nosocomiale, puisqu'aucun cas probable de SRAS n'a été retenu parmi ces patients ou leur entourage. De la confrontation de ces perceptions différentes, mais complémentaires, peuvent émerger des enseignements enrichissant la gestion interdisciplinaire d'épidémies ultérieures. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Objective.  The characteristics of patients with a suspected SARS hospitalized in a Paris hospital were studied to analyze the hypothetic differences between epidemiologic and clinical teams in the management of an epidemic emerging disease, and to gather experience for the management of the next outbreak. http://france.elsevier.com/direct/MEDMAL/ Médecine et maladies infectieuses 37 (2007) S242 S250 ☆ Ce travail a été présenté au 51 e Congrès français de médecine interne, à la 24 e Réunion interdisciplinaire de chimiothérapie anti infectieuse (RICAI) et au 6 e European congress of chemotherapy and infection (ECC) en décembre 2004.
Study design.  All 90 patients hospitalized between March 16 and April 30, 2003, were included. Epidemiological and clinical data were shared with the French National Institute for Health. Cases were classified according to both the official definition (""possible"", ""probable"", ""excluded"") and a local one, adapted from the official definition but including an additional level of suspicion (""equivocal""), intermediate between ""possible"" and ""excluded"".
Results.  The initial assessment was different in 39% of the cases (n = 35), according to epidemiological (n = 24) or clinical (n = 11) elements. The final assessment diverged in 54% of the cases (n = 47). All patients were officially considered as ""excluded"" for epidemiologists, while 47 remained as ""possible"" or ""equivocal"" cases of SARS according to the clinicians.
Conclusion.  The risk assessment was different in almost 40% of the cases, with no impact on epidemic diffusion or hospital borne exposure as no probable case of SARS was diagnosed among these patients or their households. The confrontation of these different but complementary points of view will thus enrich the interdisciplinary management of eventual future outbreaks."	0

2062	Background: SARS CoV 2 is a RNA coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome . RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, up to a million times higher than that of their hosts. Virus mutagenic capability depends upon several factors, including the fidelity of viral enzymes that replicate nucleic acids, as SARS CoV 2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Mutation rate drives viral evolution and genome variability, thereby enabling viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance.	1

Here, we present an optimized freeze 25 drying procedure that allows SARS CoV 2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at 26 ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive supplemented PCR mixes were 27 freeze dried. The residual moisture of the freeze dried PCR mixes was measured by 28 Karl Fischer titration. We found that freeze dried PCR mixes with ~1.2% residual 29 moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, 30 specificity, and repeatability of the freeze dried reagents were similar to those of freshly 31 prepared, wet reagents. The freeze dried mixes retained activity at room temperature 32 (18~25℃) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37℃ and 56℃, 33 respectively. The uptake of this approach will ease logistical challenges faced by 34 transport networks and make more cold storage space available at diagnosis and 35 hospital laboratories. This method can also be applied to the generation of freeze dried 36 PCR mixes for the detection of other pathogens. 37 38	0
2064	Analysing the combined health, social and economic impacts of the corovanvirus pandemic using agent based social simulation Abstract During the COVID 19 crisis there have been many difficult decisions governments and other decision makers had to make. E.g. do we go for a total lock down or keep schools open? How many people and which people should be tested? Although there are many good models from e.g. epidemiologists on the spread of the virus under certain conditions, these models do not directly translate into the interventions that can be taken by government. Neither can these models contribute to understand the economic and/or social consequences of the interventions. However, effective and sustainable solutions need to take into account this combination of factors. In this paper, we propose an agent based social simulation tool, ASSOCC, that supports decision makers understand possible consequences of policy interventions,	1

2068	Summary：SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) is the etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome. The aim of this study was to construct Sars CoV membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike 2 (S2) gene eukaryotic expression plasmids, and identify their expression in vitro. Gene fragments encoding N protein, M protein and S2 protein of SARS CoV were amplified by PCR using cDNA obtained from lung samples of SARS patients as template, and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector to form eukaryotic expression plasmids. SARS CoV protein eukaryotic expression plasmids were transfected respectively into CHO cells. Immunohistochemistry was employed to detect the expression of the structural proteins of SARS CoV in transfected cells. SARS CoV protein eukaryotic expression plasmids were successfully constructed by identification with digestion of restriction enzymes and sequencing. M, N and S2 proteins of SARS CoV were detected in the cytoplasm of transfected CHO cells. It was concluded that these recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmids were constructed successfully, and gene.	0
2069	"Understanding the disease pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus, denoted SARS CoV 2, is critical to the development of anti SARS CoV 2 therapeutics. The global propagation of the viral disease, denoted COVID 19 (""coronavirus disease 2019""), has unified the scientific community in searching for possible inhibitory small molecules or polypeptides. Given the known interaction between the human ACE2 (""Angiotensin converting enzyme 2"") protein and the SARS CoV virus (responsible for the coronavirus outbreak circa. 2003), considerable focus has been directed towards the putative interaction between the SARS CoV 2 Spike protein and ACE2. However, a more holistic understanding of the SARS CoV 2 vs. human inter species interactome promises additional putative protein protein interactions (PPI) that may be considered targets for the development of inhibitory therapeutics.
To that end, we leverage two state of the art, sequence based PPI predictors (PIPE4 & SPRINT) capable of generating the comprehensive SARS CoV 2 vs. human interactome, comprising approximately 285,000 pairwise predictions. Of these, we identify the high scoring subset of human proteins predicted to interact with each of the 14 SARS CoV 2 proteins by both methods, comprising 279 highconfidence putative interactions involving 225 human proteins. Notably, the Spike ACE2 interaction was the highest ranked for both the PIPE4 and SPRINT predictors, corroborating existing evidence for this PPI. Furthermore, the PIPE Sites algorithm was used to predict the putative subsequence that might mediate each interaction and thereby inform the design of inhibitory polypeptides intended to disrupt the corresponding host pathogen interactions.
We hereby publicly release the comprehensive set of PPI predictions and their corresponding PIPE Sites landscapes in the following DataVerse repository: 10.5683/SP2/JZ77XA. All data and metadata are released under a CC BY 4.0 licence. The information provided represents theoretical modeling only and caution should be exercised in its use. It is intended as a resource for the scientific community at large in furthering our understanding of SARS CoV 2. : bioRxiv preprint Promisingly, many computational approaches have been rapidly deployed to increase our understanding of SARS CoV 2, including protein function, three dimensional (3D) protein structures, and possible target regions for small inhibitory molecules [2, 3] . Through the use of publication preprint platforms, this information can be immediately disseminated, albeit, with the disclaimer of ""non peer reviewed"" research. Two notable examples include the use of DeepMind's recently published AplhaFold protein structure predictor [2] to predict the 3D protein structure of each of the SARS CoV 2 proteins, and the use of the SUMMIT high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure to perform large scale virtual docking simulations as a form of high throughput screening to identify small inhibitory molecules [3] . Given that the Spike protein from the original SARS coronavirus, SARS CoV, is known to interact with the human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), current efforts are focused to better characterize the SARS CoV 2 Spike protein and its putative interaction with the ACE2 protein.
Following from a previous study of the Zika virus in 2016 [9], we defined two prediction schemas from which to train the PPI predictors. First, the all schema, contains the maximum available number of known virus host PPIs regardless of the evolutionary distance between those viruses and the target virus (i.e. SARS CoV 2). This schema groups all viruses into a ""viral"" collection to serve as a proxy for SARS CoV 2. The second schema, denoted proximal, is a subset of the all schema, where only the PPIs from evolutionarily related organisms are considered. In both schemas, to avoid possible overfitting, the previously known SARS CoV Spike vs. ACE2 interaction was removed. We retained the other 2 . CC BY 4.0"	0

2073	"The new coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS CoV 2 to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. SARS CoV 2 may use co receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted ""CellPhoneDB"" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis."	0
2074	The outbreak of COVID 19 in different parts of the world is a major concern for all the administrative units of respective countries. India is also facing this very tough task for controlling the virus outbreak and has managed its growth rate through some strict measures. This study presents the current situation of coronavirus spread in India along with the impact of various measures taken for it. With the help of data sources (till 7 th  8 th April 2020) from various state units of India and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, this study presents various trends and patterns. This study answers six different research questions in a comprehensive manner. It has been reported that growth rate of infected cases has been controlled with the help of National Lockdown, however some uncontrolled mass level events had a negative impact on the infected cases. With the help of exponential and polynomial regression modelling, the predictions of up to 75000 cases have been done by the end of April 2020. It has also been seen that there are some prominent clusters and patient nodes in the network of patients which are the major influencers for COVID 19 spread. Also, death rate case predictions have been done through two class classification models with an accuracy of 60%. At the end, strategies for continuation for lockdown has been discussed and presented. It appears that only essential services should be open for the citizens of India and the national lockdown should be carried on for next 2 4 weeks. This study will be useful for the Government of India and various states of India, Administrative Units of India, Frontline health workforce of India, researchers and scientists. This study will also be favorable for the administrative units of other countries to consider various aspects regions.	0

2076	"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) infected pneumonia (COVID 19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Travel associated cases have also been reported in other countries. The number of cases has increased rapidly but laboratory diagnosis is limited. METHODS: We collect two groups of cases diagnosed with COVID 19 for experiments. One group collected 63 samples for Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples for colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA). RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection was 55/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG detection was 75/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls, specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of between ELISA and GICA (IgM  IgG). CONCLUSIONS: ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies are conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be .The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. By February 27, 2020, there were 78630 confirmed cases reported in China, and tragically we have now surpassed 2747 people in China have lost their lives because of this virus.

We investigate the changes in R0 for COVID 19 on the DP from January 21 to February 19, 2020 with a chainbinomial model at different times under two scenarios: no quarantine assuming a random mixing condition, and quarantine of passengers in cabins  passengers may get infected either by an infectious case in a shared cabin or by asymptomatic crew who continued to work. Our modeling approach takes account of the asymptomatic ratio of crew members during the quarantine of passengers, which has not been explored in the literature. Assuming an asymptomatic ratio 0.505 and the proportion of infections in cabins 0.2, R0 at the beginning of the epidemic was 3.27 (95% CI (3.02, 3.54)) and 3.78 (95% CI (3.49, 4.09)) respectively for serial intervals of 5 and 6 days, and increased for passengers in contact with asymptomatic crew during quarantine. We find evidence to support a CDC report that ""a high proportion of asymptomatic infections could partially explain the high attack rate among cruise ship passengers and crew."" This emphasizes the importance of improved reporting and quarantine of asymptomatic cases, and raises questions on quarantine procedures in closed environments such as military vessels, cruise densities."	0

2081	The world has witnessed unprecedented human and economic loss from the COVID 19 disease, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2. Extensive research is being conducted across the globe to identify therapeutic agents against the SARS CoV 2. Here, we use a powerful and efficient computational strategy by combining machine learning (ML) based models and high fidelity ensemble docking simulations to enable rapid screening of possible therapeutic molecules (or ligands). Our screening is based on the binding affinity to either the isolated SARS CoV 2 S protein at its host receptor region or to the Sprotein human ACE2 interface complex, thereby potentially limiting and/or disrupting the host virus interactions. We first apply our screening strategy to two drug datasets (CureFFI and DrugCentral) to identify hundreds of ligands that bind strongly to the aforementioned two systems. Candidate ligands were then validated by all atom docking simulations. The validated ML models were subsequently used to screen a large bio molecule dataset (with nearly a million entries) to provide a rank ordered list of ∼19,000 potentially useful compounds for further validation. Overall, this work not only expands our knowledge of small molecule treatment against COVID 19, but also provides an efficient pathway to perform high throughput computational drug screening by combining quick ML surrogate models with expensive high fidelity simulations, for accelerating the therapeutic cure of diseases.	1
2082	"The novel corona virus has led to a pandemic, affecting almost all countries and regions in a few weeks, and therefore a global plan is needed to overcome this battle. Iran has been among the first few countries that has been affected severely, after China, which forced the government to put some restriction and enforce social distancing in majority of the country. In less than 2 months, Iran has more than 80,000 confirmed cases, and more than 5,000 death. Based on the official statistics from Iran's government, the number of daily cases has started to go down recently, but many people believe if the lockdown is lifted without proper social distancing enforcement, there is a possibility for a second wave of COVID 19 cases. In this work, we analyze at the data for the number cases in Iran in the past few weeks, and train a predictive model to estimate the possible future trends for the number of cases in Iran, depending on the government policy in the coming weeks and months. Our analysis may help political leaders and health officials to take proper action toward handling COVID 19 in the coming months.

2086	Background: Conflicting recommendations exist related to whether masks have a protective effect on the spread of respiratory viruses. Results: A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.35 and 95% CI = 0.24 0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non healthcare workers (Non HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80% (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.11 0.37) and 47% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36 0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR = 0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR = 0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR = 0.55), SARS (OR = 0.26), and SARS CoV 2 (OR = 0.04).

2088	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship has caused over 634 cases as of February 20, 2020. We model the transmission process on the ship with a stochastic model and estimate the basic reproduction number at 2.2 (95%CI: 2.1−2.4). We estimate a large dispersion parameter than other coronaviruses, which implies that the virus is difficult to go extinction. The epidemic doubling time is at 4.6 days (95%CI: 3.0−9.3), and thus timely actions were crucial. The lesson learnt on the ship is generally applicable in other settings.	1

Considering the clinical impact of the new outbreak, it is highly important to study the potential responses of the human immune system during the SARS CoV 2 infection as well as the role of virus specific T cells and by B lymphocytes. Moreover, specific data on the production of IgG and IgM is crucial to allow the rapid identification of the infection. In this paper we also described the importance of sensitive and specific rapid test for SARS CoV 2.

The unprecedented pandemic of COVID 19 has created worldwide shortages of personal protective 10 equipment, in particular respiratory protection such as N95 respirators 1 . SARS CoV 2 transmission is 11 frequently occurring in hospital settings, with numerous reported cases of nosocomial transmission 12 highlighting the vulnerability of healthcare workers 2 4 . In general, N95 respirators are designed for single 13 use prior to disposal. Several groups have addressed the potential for re use of N95 respirators from a 14 mechanical or from a decontamination perspective (for a full literature overview see Supplementary   15 Appendix).
Here, we analyzed four different decontamination methods  UV radiation (260  285 nm), 70ºC heat, 18 70% ethanol and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP)  for their ability to reduce contamination with 19 infectious SARS CoV 2 and their effect on N95 respirator function. For each of the decontamination 20 methods, we compared the inactivation rate of SARS CoV 2 on N95 filter fabric to that on stainless steel, 21 and we used quantitative fit testing to measure the filtration performance of the N95 respirators after each 22 decontamination run and 2 hours of wear, for three consecutive decontamination and wear sessions (see 23 Appendix). Vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ethanol yielded extremely rapid inactivation both on N95 24 and on stainless steel ( Figure 1A ). UV inactivated SARS CoV 2 rapidly from steel but more slowly on 25 N95 fabric, likely due its porous nature. Heat caused more rapid inactivation on N95 than on steel; 26 inactivation rates on N95 were comparable to UV.
Quantitative fit tests showed that the filtration performance of the N95 respirator was not markedly 29 reduced after a single decontamination for any of the four decontamination methods ( Figure 1B ).
Subsequent rounds of decontamination caused sharp drops in filtration performance of the ethanol treated 31 masks, and to a slightly lesser degree, the heat treated masks. The VHP and UV treated masks retained 32 comparable filtration performance to the control group after two rounds of decontamination, and 33 maintained acceptable performance after three rounds. 34 35 for use under a CC0 license. : medRxiv preprint Taken together, our findings show that VHP treatment exhibits the best combination of rapid inactivation 36 of SARS CoV 2 and preservation of N95 respirator integrity, under the experimental conditions used here 37 (Figure 1C). UV radiation kills the virus more slowly and preserves comparable respirator function. 70ºC 38 dry heat kills with similar speed and is likely to maintain acceptable fit scores for two rounds of 39 decontamination. Ethanol decontamination is not recommended due to loss of N95 integrity, echoing 40 earlier findings 5 . 41 42 All treatments, particularly UV and dry heat, should be conducted for long enough to ensure that a 43 sufficient reduction in virus concentration has been achieved. The degree of required reduction will 44 depend upon the degree of initial virus contamination. Policymakers can use our estimated decay rates 45 together with estimates of degree of real world contamination to choose appropriate treatment durations 46 (see Appendix).
Our results indicate that N95 respirators can be decontaminated and re used in times of shortage for up to 49 three times for UV and HPV, and up to two times for dry heat. However, utmost care should be given to 50 ensure the proper functioning of the N95 respirator after each decontamination using readily available 51 qualitative fit testing tools and to ensure that treatments are carried out for sufficient time to achieve 52 desired risk reduction. 53 for use under a CC0 license. : medRxiv preprint 54 55 Figure 1.

2098	"Objective: The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID 19) not only caused particularly large public health problems, but also caused great psychological distress, especially for medical staff. We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID 19 outbreak.
Method: Medical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers. The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self design questions related to the COVID 19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress related symptoms. We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms.
Result: There were a total of 1,563 participants in our study. Five hundred and sixty four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score ≥ 8). A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.0 7.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.2 0.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.0 2.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.6 3.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID 19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.3 3.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.3 8.5).
Conclusion: Our study found that more than one third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID 19 outbreak. The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID 19 outbreak, and being a doctor. Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various sociopsychological factors at play in this situation."	0
2099	Many hospitalized patients with COVID 19 will develop delirium, and given early insights into the pathobiology of this virus indicating invasion into the brain stem, as well as the emerging interventions utilized to treat these critically ill patients, delirium prevention and management may prove exceedingly challenging, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). This component of the conversation is especially important given the early anecdotal recommendations to treat patients with COVID 19 in the prone position [81], which will be uncomfortable and thus likely be met with even higher than usual amounts of sedation, which could beget very high rates of delirium down the line in the management of these already high risk patients. In the patients with COVID 19, delirium can be a manifestation of direct CNS invasion, induction of CNS inflammatory mediators, secondary effects of other organ system failure, and untoward medical and environmental factors including heavy use of sedatives for prone positioning of the patient and quarantining and social isolation during care. It is precisely during such times that standardization of safety concerns encapsulated in the ABCDEF bundle can provide a framework to help us accomplish “whole person” care that will help with acute management success as well as improvement of long term survivorship and reductions of whole.	0
2100	"Objectives: To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV). Methods: Based on the susceptible exposed infected removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019 nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome. Results: The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 to 3.3 by using the real time reports on the number of 2019 nCoV infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues. Using a newly reported epidemiological determinants for early 2019 nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is in the range [2.2,3.0].

Effectiveness of hand hygiene and provision of information in preventing influenza ★ cases requiring hospitalization ☆ , ☆☆ , Background. The objective of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of non pharmacological interventions in preventing cases of influenza requiring hospitalization.
Methods. We performed a multicenter case control study in 36 hospitals, in 2010 in Spain. Hospitalized influenza cases confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and three matched controls (two hospital and one community control) per case were selected. The use of non pharmacological measures seven days before the onset of symptoms (frequency of hand washing, use of alcohol based hand sanitizers and handwashing after touching contaminated surfaces) was collected.
Results. We studied 813 cases hospitalized for influenza and 2274 controls. The frequency of hand washing 5 10 times (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.65) and > 10 times (aOR = 0.59) and handwashing after contact with contaminated surfaces (aOR = 0.65) were protective factors and were dose responsive (p b 0.001). Alcohol based hand sanitizers were associated with marginal benefits (aOR = 0.82).
Conclusions. Frequent handwashing should be recommended to prevent influenza cases requiring hospitalization."	0

2104	The number of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is increasing rapidly and, as of 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization has declared that this can be characterised as a pandemic.1 Governments are preparing for the worst, quickly realising the impact that COVID 19 is having on health services and the global economy. During infectious disease outbreaks, telehealth can enable remote triaging of care and provide rapidly accessible information through technology – such as chatbots, as seen in Singapore during COVID 19.3 Telehealth can also assist with disease diagnosis via video consultations with health professionals. In March 2020, emergency supplemental funding legislation for coronavirus was passed in the USA which allows the federal government to expand telehealth to patients in metropolitan areas and also allows physicians to care for patients in their homes.27 In Australia, there have been similar calls to relax restrictions on general practitioner provided telehealth consultations.28 Whilst remuneration for telehealth services is an important requirement, a focus on funding alone will not generate an effective telehealth service.	0

2106	"publicly funded repositories, such as the WHO COVID database with rights for unrestricted research re use and analyses in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source. These permissions are granted for free by Elsevier for as long as the COVID 19 resource centre remains active. practical requirement in the development of any EIAV vaccine is compatibility with established regulatory policies and diagnostic assays. The ability of EIAV infected horses to routinely establish immunologic control over virus replication and disease suggests that an effective vaccine can indeed be developed, if the critical natural immune correlates of protection can be elicited by a candidate vaccine. An attenuated live EIAV vaccine with a reported protection efficacy of about 70% has been used in China since the early 1980s, but the effectiveness of this vaccine remains to be confirmed outside of that country. Evaluation of other candidate EIAV vaccines (live attenuated, inactivated whole virus, subunit vaccines, synthetic peptides, etc.) under experimental conditions has revealed a spectrum of vaccine efficacy that ranges from 'sterile protection' (prevention of infection upon inoculation with EIAV) to severe elevation of EIAVreplication, and exacerbation of disease. These results indicate that immune responses to EIAVare a double edged sword that can either mediate protection or yield vaccine enhancement. Vaccine enhancement has previously been reported for other viral infections (dengue virus, respiratory syncitial virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus) and is of special concern with macrophage tropic viruses. Similar examples of vaccine protection and enhancement have been reported in studies of experimental vaccines for other lentiviruses, including feline immunodeficiency virus, caprine arthritis encephalitis virus, and visna maedi virus. These observations in several diverse animal lentivirus systems suggest that the potential for immune enhancement may be a general property of lentiviruses, including HIV 1. Current efforts in the production of a commercial EIAV vaccine are focused on the development of a vaccine that can achieve sufficient maturation of immune responses to provide protection from virus infection, but allow the serological differentiation between vaccinated and infected horses. In this regard, DNA vaccine strategies appear to be well suited to accomplish these criteria for a commercial EIAV vaccine.
EIAV provides a dynamic system for examining the interaction between virus populations and host immune responses that are evolving in response to each other. In addition, EIAV offers a remarkable model for studying the delicate balance between immune responses to a persistent virus infection that result in disease and those that have beneficial results. A characterization of the nature of protective and enhancing immune responses can provide important information about the mechanisms of lentivirus disease and the type of immune responses to be elicited or avoided by a vaccine. The results of these studies in the EIAV system should be applicable to other lentiviruses, including HIV 1."	0
2107	"This study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS CoV2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples. This analysis will provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in the viral genome.
Novel coronavirus has wrecked medical and health care facilities claiming ~5% death tolls globally. All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largely remained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus. In the present study, we compared the 2019 nCoV with other coronaviruses, which indicated that bat SARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus. The protein sequence similarity of pangolin hCoV and bat hCoV with human coronavirus was higher as compared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutations in the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of different clades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acid changes. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in the coding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non synonymous type. The non synonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed over different hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein. An important di amino acid change RG to KR was observed in ORF9 protein. Additionally, several interesting features of the novel coronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruses which may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behind failure of the antiviral therapies.

2108	Objective: In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia. Methods: There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019 nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb. Results: Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti 2019 nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response. Conclusion: Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti 2019 nCoV compounds.	0
2109	Although this virus belongs to a relatively well known viral family, Coronaviridae, and is similar to viruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had an outbreak in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which had an outbreak in 2012, in some characteristics, there are a lot of uncertainties and unknown specifications about this virus such as its mechanism of action and transmission (3, 4). Given that most studies on CoVID 19 are in an early stage, and there are some limitations such as small number of studies, and reports being restricted to China and a few other countries, due to the pandemic nature of the disease, specific patterns should be introduced for different groups, including people with underlying diseases, to minimize the harm.	1
2110	"Efficient detoxification of ammonia through the liver is critical to avoid ammonia accumulation in blood and prevent hepatic encephalopathy . The process of ureagenesis involves consumption of ATP and extensive exchange of molecules between the cytosol and mitochondria . In order to meet the high energy demand of ureagenesis, liver mitochondria increase O2 consumption to make ATP through oxidative phosphorylation .
Here, oxygen consumption rates (OCR) by cultured rat hepatocytes were measured in a Seahorse Bioscience extracellular flux analyzer . A panel of 140 protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors was screened to determine their effects on ureagenesis induced mitochondrial respiration . Isolated rat hepatocytes were cultured on collagen coated Seahorse 96 well microplates and used within 30 h . Respiration was measured in pH 7 .4 Krebs Ringer Hepes (KRH) buffer supplemented with 5 mM NaHCO3 . Inhibitors (10 μM), ureagenic substrates (3 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM ornithine and 5 mM Na lactate) and rotenone (2 μM) were injected sequentially during measurements of OCR . Ureagenic substrates caused a 70 100% increase of OCR above rotenone sensitive basal respiration . The screening identified drug effects categorized into three main groups: 1) no change in basal respiration, no change in ureagenic respiration; 2) change in basal respiration, no change in ureagenic respiration; 3) no change in basal respiration, change in ureagenic respiration . Two groups of inhibitors in Category 3 included those affecting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and protein kinase C (PKC) dependent pathways . EGFR inhibitors, including AG 825 (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), erbstatin and gefitinib, enhanced, whereas PKC inhibitors, including bisindolylmaleimide I, chelerythrine chloride and Gö 6983, suppressed ureagenic respiration without affecting basal respiration . Although EGF can activate PKC downstream of EGFR, our results suggest alternative pathways arising from EGFR, the elucidation of which may yield new information on the nature of the regulation of ureagenesis and mitochondrial respiration . We also found that NVP AEW541 hydrochloride, an insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1 R) inhibitor that blocks IGF1 R autophosphorylation, enhanced ureagenic respiration . Since Insulin can inhibit ureagenesis, this result validates our assay . In conclusion, activation of EGFR and IGF1 R inhibits ureagenic respiration, whereas PKC activation increases ureagenic respiration (NIDDK and NIAAA) .

2112	Objective: This study presents a preliminary report on the chest radiographic and computed tomography (CT) findings of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID 19) pneumonia in Korea. Materials and Methods: As part of a multi institutional collaboration coordinated by the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology, we collected nine patients with COVID 19 infections who had undergone chest radiography and CT scans. We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of COVID 19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher's exact test was used to compare CT findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions. Results: Three of the nine patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill defined and were composed of mixed ground glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground glass opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p < 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006). Conclusion: COVID 19 pneumonia in Korea primarily manifested as pure to mixed ground glass opacities with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. A considerable proportion of patients with COVID 19 pneumonia had normal chest radiographs.	0

2114	A mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China. Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization. We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019 nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019 nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS like CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019 nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha helix, following with a beta sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019 nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing	1

2116	"The ongoing COVID 19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented need for rapid diagnostic testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend a standard assay that includes an RNA extraction step from a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab followed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) to detect the purified SARS CoV 2 RNA. The current global shortage of RNA extraction kits has caused a severe bottleneck to COVID 19 testing. We hypothesized that SARS CoV 2 RNA could be detected from NP samples via a direct RT qPCR assay that omits the RNA extraction step altogether, and tested this hypothesis on a series of blinded clinical samples. The direct RT qPCR approach correctly identified 92% of NP samples (n = 155) demonstrated to be positive for SARS CoV 2 RNA by traditional clinical diagnostic RT qPCR that included an RNA extraction. Thus, direct RT qPCR could be a front line approach to identify the substantial majority of COVID 19 patients, reserving a repeat test with RNA extraction for those individuals with high suspicion of infection but an initial negative result. This strategy would drastically ease supply chokepoints of COVID 19 testing and should be applicable throughout the world.
The ongoing COVID 19 pandemic has put exceptional strain on public health laboratories, hospital laboratories, and commercial laboratories as they attempt to keep up with demands for SARS CoV 2 testing. The current diagnostic testing methods recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States and the World Health Organization (WHO) are traditional RT qPCR assays that require two steps: first, an RNA extraction from patient nasopharyngeal (NP) swab material, followed by RT qPCR amplification of the extracted RNA to detect viral RNA 1 3 . The major bottleneck to widespread SARS CoV 2 testing lies at the RNA extraction step. The simplest manual kit (the Qiagen Viral RNA Mini) is no longer available, and reagents and supplies for the larger automated instruments are extremely limited with uncertain supply chains. While substitution of other RNA extraction kits 4,5 is possible, they too are in limited supply. The current bottleneck is not simply the availability of RNA extraction kits, but also the cost of the extraction assay, the labor and time required to perform it, and the fact that it is rate limiting compared to the downstream RT qPCR analysis. To address this issue, we tested the unconventional approach of skipping the RNA extraction step altogether and directly loading patient swab material into the RT qPCR mix. Herein, we report that this approach (which we refer to hereafter as ""direct RT qPCR"") correctly identified 92% of samples (n =155) previously shown to be positive for SARS CoV 2 RNA by conventional RT qPCR featuring an RNA extraction. Thus, our results suggest that this streamlined assay could greatly alleviate constraints to COVID 19 testing in many regions of the world.
We initially conducted a pilot experiment using NP swabs from two COVID 19 patients who had previously been verified for SARS CoV 2 infection by the Vermont Department of Health Laboratory (VDHL) using the CDC's recommended RT qPCR test. Both patient samples, which were originally collected as NP swabs in 3 mL of M6 viral transport medium (termed diluent hereafter), were pooled (equi volume). RNA was extracted from 140 µL of the pooled sample using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, and purified RNA representing 11.3 µL of the original swab diluent was detected as positive via standard RT qPCR using the CDC 2019 nCoV N3 primer/probe set, with a CT of 18.7. In parallel, we added 7 µL of the pooled COVID 19 patient NP swab diluent directly to the RT qPCR reaction, and found that SARS CoV 2 RNA was ."	0
2117	"The COVID 19 pandemic is caused by the single stranded RNA virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2), a virus of zoonotic origin that was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019. There is evidence that homologous recombination contributed to this cross species transmission. Since that time the virus has demonstrated a high propensity for human to human transmission.
Here we report two newly identified adjacent amino acid polymorphisms in the nucleocapsid at positions 203 and 204 (R203K/G204R) due to three adjacent nucleotide changes across the two codons (i.e. AGG GGA to AAA CGA). This new strain within the LGG clade may have arisen by a form of homologous recombination from the core sequence (CS B) of the transcription regulating sequences of SAS CoV 2 itself and has rapidly increased to approximately one third of reported sequences from Europe during the month of March 2020. We note that these polymorphisms are predicted to reduce the binding of an overlying putative HLA C*07 restricted epitope and that HLA C*07 is prevalent in Caucasians being carried by >40% of the population. The findings suggest that homologous recombination may have occurred since its introduction into humans and be a mechanism for populations."	0
2118	"As COVID 19 is rapidly spreading across the globe, short term modeling forecasts provide timecritical information for decisions on containment and mitigation strategies. A main challenge for short term forecasts is the assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change as first governmental intervention measures are showing an effect. By combining an established epidemiological model with Bayesian inference, we analyze the time dependence of the effective growth rate of new infections. For the case of COVID 19 spreading in Germany, we detect change points in the effective growth rate that correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions. Thereby, we can (a) quantify the effects of recent governmental measures to mitigating the disease spread, and (b) incorporate the corresponding change points to forecast future scenarios and case numbers. Our code is freely available and can be readily adapted to any country or region.

However, predictive factors for the outcomes remain unclear.
Objective: attempted to determine the predictive factors for the poor outcomes of patients with COVID 19.
Study design: This is a single center, retrospective study. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed from 111 hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed COVID 19 in Union Hospital. The gathered data of discharged and deteriorated patients were compared.
: Among these 111 patients, 93 patients were discharged and 18 patients were deteriorated. The lymphocyte count (0.56 G/L [0.47 0.63] vs 1.30 G/L [0.95 1.65]) was lower in the deteriorated group than those in the discharged group. The numbers of pulmonary lobe involved (5.00 [5.00 5.00] vs 4.00 [2.00 5.00]), serum C reactive protein (CRP, 79.52 mg/L [61.25 102.98] vs 7.93 mg/L [3.14 22.50]), IL 6 (35.72 pg/ml [9.24 85.19] vs 5.09 pg/ml [3.16 9.72]), and IL 10 (5.35 pg/ml [4.48 7.84] vs 3.97 pg/ml [3.34 4.79]) concentrations in deteriorated patients were elevated compared with discharged patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male gender (OR, 24.8 [1.8 342.1]), comorbidity (OR, 52.6 [3.6 776.4]), lymphopenia (OR, 17.3 [1.1 261.8]), and elevated CRP (OR, 96.5 [4.6 2017.6]) were the independent risk factors for the poor prognosis in COVID 19 patients.

2129	"Background: There is uncertainty about the role of different age groups in propagating the SARS CoV 2 epidemics in different countries, particularly under current social distancing practices.
Methods: We used the Robert Koch Institute data on weekly COVID 19 cases in different age groups in Germany. To minimize the effect of changes in healthcare seeking behavior (e.g. for older adults) and testing practices, we included the following eight 5 year age groups in the analyses: 10 14y through 45 49y. For each age group , we considered the proportion ( ) of 1.07(0.99,1.16)), aged 25 29y (RR= 1.06(0.98,1.15)), aged 35 39y (RR=0.95(0.87,1.03)), aged 40 44y (RR=0.9(0.83,0.98)), aged 45 49y (RR=0.83(0.77,0.89)) and aged 10 14y (RR=0.78(0.64,0.95)). For the age group 20 24y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. For the age group 15 19y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group either above 35y or 10 14y for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1.
Conclusions: The observed relative increase with time in the prevalence of individuals aged 15 34y (particularly those aged 20 24y) among detected COVID 19 cases in Germany is unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood of seeking medical care or the likelihood of being tested for individuals in those age groups compared to individuals aged 35 49y or 10 14y, and should be indicative of the actual increase in the prevalence of individuals aged 15 34y among SARS CoV 2 infections in the German population. That increase likely reflects elevated mixing among individuals aged 15 34y (particularly those aged 20 24y) compared to other age groups, possibly due to lesser adherence to social distancing practices."	0

In this way, a graph is connected in which the likelihood of infectious spread from person to person is determined by the intensity of interpersonal contact. Infectious transfer is determined by chance. The model is extended to incorporate various lockdown scenarios.	1

Using the Maximum Hasting (MH) parameter estimation method and the modified Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model, the spread of the epidemic under three intervention scenarios (suppression, mitigation, mildness) are simulated and predicted in South Africa, Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 2 Egypt, and Algeria, where the epidemic situations are severe. The studies are also conducted in Nigeria, Senegal and Kenya, where the epidemic situations are growing rapidly and the socio economic are relatively under developed, resulting in more difficulties in preventing the epidemic. Results indicated that the epidemic can be basically controlled in late April with strict control of scenario one, manifested by the circumstance in the South Africa and Senegal.
Under moderate control of scenario two, the number of infected people will increase by 1.43~1.55 times of that in scenario one, the date of the epidemic being controlled will be delayed by about 10 days, and Algeria, Nigeria, and Kenya are in accordance with this situation. In the third scenario of weak control, the epidemic will be controlled by late May, the total number of infected cases will double that in scenario two, and Egypt is in line with this prediction. In the end, a series of epidemic controlling methods are proposed, including patient quarantine, close contact tracing, population movement control, government intervention, city and county epidemic risk level classification, and medical cooperation and the Chinese assistance."	0

We developed a data driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS CoV 2. The retrospective study using the past SARS CoV and MERS CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates : bioRxiv preprint against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet lab validation indicated that a poly ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID 19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS CoV 2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG induced IL 6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS CoV 2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS CoV 2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS CoV 2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors against SARS CoV 2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our data driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID 19. author/funder.

Results
The overview of our data driven drug repositioning framework is shown in Figure 1A . We first constructed a virus related knowledge graph consisting of drug target interactions, protein protein interactions and similarity networks from publically available databases (Methods). Three different types of nodes (i.e., drugs, human targets and virus targets) within the knowledge graph were connected through edges describing their interactions, associations or similarities to establish bridges of information aggregation and knowledge mining. We then applied a network based knowledge mining algorithm to predict an initial list of drug candidates that can be potentially used to treat SARS CoV 2 infection ( Figure 1B and Methods). Next, we further narrowed down the list of drug candidates with the previously reported evidences of antiviral activities based on the text mining results from the large scale literature texts, which were derived through a deep learning based relation extraction method named BERE [4] ( Figure 1C and Methods), followed by a minimum of manual checking. After that, we used the connectivity map analysis approach [5] with the gene expression profiles of ten SARS CoV infected patients [6] to further refine the list of drug candidates against SARS CoV 2 ( Figure 1D , Table 1, Table S1 and Methods). The above screening process revealed that a poly ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor PJ 34 could potentially have the antiviral activities against SARS CoV 2. 4 author/funder.

2140	"Background. The number of screening tests carried out in France and the methodology used to target the patients tested do not allow for a direct computation of the actual number of cases and the infection fatality ratio (IFR). The main objective of this work is to estimate the actual number of people infected with COVID 19 and to deduce the IFR during the observation window in France.
Methods. We develop a 'mechanistic statistical' approach coupling a SIR epidemiological model describing the unobserved epidemiological dynamics, a probabilistic model describing the data acquisition process and a statistical inference method.
Results. The actual number of infected cases in France is probably higher than the observations: we find here a factor ×8 (95% CI: 5 12) which leads to an IFR in France of 0.5% (95% CI: 0.3−0.8) based on hospital death counting data. Adjusting for the number of deaths in nursing homes, we obtain an IFR of 0.8% (95% CI: 0.45 − 1.25).
Conclusions. This IFR is consistent with previous findings in China (0.66%) and in the UK (0.9%) and lower than the value previously computed on the Diamond Princess cruse ship data (1.3%)."	0
2141	"Background In December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) infected pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of SARS CoV 2 pneumonia without comorbidities compared to normal controls in Chinese Han population is limited. Our objective is to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS CoV 2 pneumonia without comorbidities compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population.
Methods Retrospective, multi center case series of the 69 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS CoV 2 pneumonia,
The study population included 69 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS CoV 2 pneumonia without comorbidities and 14,117 normal controls. 50.7% patients were male and 49.3% were female; 1.5% patients were asymptomatic cases, 63.8% patients were mild cases, and 36.2% patients were severe or critical cases. Compared with mild patients (n=44), severe or critical patients (n=25) were significantly older (median age, 67 years [IQR, vs. 49 years [IQR, 36 60]; p<0.01). Fever was present in 98.6% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (62.3%), fatigue (58.0%), sputum (39.1%), and headache (33.3%). The median incubation period was 4 days (IQR, 2 to 7). Leukocyte count was 74.1% of normal controls and lymphocyte count was 45.9% of normal controls. The phenomenon of lymphocyte depletion (PLD) observed in severe or critical cases in 100%.

2142	"Many countries have applied lockdown that helped suppress COVID 19, but with devastating economic consequences. Here we propose exit strategies from lockdown that provide sustainable, albeit reduced, economic activity. We use mathematical models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4 day work and 10 day lockdown, or similar variants, can prevent resurgence of the epidemic while providing part time employment. The cycle pushes the reproduction number R below one by reduced exposure time and by exploiting the virus latent period: those infected during work days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days. The number of work days can be adapted in response to observations. Throughout, full epidemiological measures need to continue including hygiene, physical distancing, compartmentalization, testing and contact tracing. This conceptual framework, when combined with other interventions to control the epidemic, can offer the beginnings of predictability to many economic sectors.
Current non pharmaceutical interventions to suppress COVID 19 use testing, contact tracing, physical distancing, mask use, identification of regional outbreaks, compartmentalization down to the neighborhood and company level, and population level quarantine at home known as lockdown 1 4 . The aim is to flatten the infection curve and prevent overload of the medical system until a vaccine becomes available.
Lockdown is currently in place in many countries. It has a large economic and social cost, including unemployment on a massive scale. Once a lockdown has reduced the number of critical cases to a desired goal, a decision must be reached on how to exit it responsibly. The main concern is the risk of resurgence of the epidemic. One strategy proposes reinstating lockdown when a threshold number of critical cases is exceeded in a resurgence, and stopping lockdown again once cases drop below a low threshold 2,5,6 ( Fig  1A,S1 ). While such an ""adaptive triggering"" strategy can prevent healthcare services from becoming overloaded, it leads to economic uncertainty and continues to accumulate cases with each resurgence."	0
2143	"Entry of SARS CoV 2, etiological agent of COVID 19, in the host cell is driven by the interaction of its spike protein with human ACE2 receptor and a serine protease, TMPRSS2.
Although complex between SARS CoV 2 spike protein and ACE2 has been structurally resolved, the molecular details of the SARS CoV 2 and TMPRSS2 complex are still elusive.
TMPRSS2 is responsible for priming of the viral spike protein that entails cleavage of the spike protein at two potential sites, Arg685/Ser686 and Arg815/Ser816. The present study aims to investigate the conformational details of complex between TMPRSS2 and SARS CoV 2 spike protein, in order to discern the finer details of the priming of viral spike and to point candidate drug targets. Briefly, full length structural model of TMPRSS2 was developed and docked against the resolved structure of SARS CoV 2 spike protein with directional restraints of both cleavage sites. The docking simulations showed that TMPRSS2 interacts with the two different loops of SARS CoV 2 spike protein, each containing different cleavage sites. Key functional residues of TMPRSS2 (His296, Ser441 and Ser460) were found to interact with immediate flanking residues of cleavage sites of SARS CoV 2 spike protein. Compared to the N terminal cleavage site (Arg685/Ser686), TMPRSS2 region that interact with C terminal cleavage site (Arg815/Ser816) of the SARS CoV 2 spike protein was predicted as relatively more druggable.
In summary, the present study provide structural characteristics of molecular complex between human TMPRSS2 and SARS CoV 2 spike protein and points to the candidate drug targets that could further be exploited to direct structure base drug designing."	0

Special Features R espiratory diseases are among the leading causes of death and major health threats in modern China. The development of modern respiratory medicine in China has undergone three phases, primarily driven by the disease burdens and the corresponding regulation priorities.
The fi rst phase (1920s to 1960s) was a phase of prevention and management of TB. During this period, pulmonary TB was the most common respiratory disease in China. TB was extensively studied, and TB control was one of the top priorities in national public health programs in the 1950s. 1 When effective prevention and treatment became available and TB was brought under control, the focus gradually shifted to other respiratory diseases.
The second phase (1970s to mid 1990s) was that of prevention and management of cor pulmonale. The prevention and treatment of the four respiratory diseases of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, cor pulmonale, and infl uenza dominated the fi eld. As a result, a specialized department focusing on respiratory medicine was established in most general hospitals, and many participating physicians became respiratory specialists. This period laid a solid foundation for the development of respiratory medicine in China.
The third phase (mid 1990s to present) is that of modern respiratory medicine. Respiratory medicine has developed rapidly in China. Respiratory medicine and critical care medicine have been merged as one department of respiratory and critical care medicine in many leading hospitals, and respiratory/medical ICUs The past century witnessed a rapid development of respiratory medicine in China. The major burden of respiratory disease has shifted from infectious diseases to chronic noninfectious diseases. Great achievements have been made in improving the national standard of clinical management of various respiratory diseases and in smoking control. The specialty of respiratory medicine is expanding into pulmonary and critical care medicine. Nevertheless, respiratory diseases remain a major public health problem, with new challenges such as air pollution and nosocomial infections. This review describes the history, accomplishments, new challenges, and opportunities in respiratory medicine in China.

2147	The COVID 19 pandemic has spread across more than 200 countries and resulted in over 170,000 deaths. For unclear reasons, higher mortality rates from COVID 19 have been reported in men compared to women. While the SARS CoV 2 receptor ACE2 and serine protease TMPRSS2 have been detected in lung and other tissues, it is not clear what sex differences may exist. We analyzed a publicly available normal human prostate single cell RNA sequencing dataset and found TMPRSS2 and ACE2 coexpressing cells in epithelial cells, with a higher proportion in club and hillock cells. Then we investigated datasets of lung epithelial cells and also found club cells co expressing TMPRSS2 and ACE2. A comparison of ACE2 expression in lung tissue between males and females showed higher expression in males and a larger proportion of ACE2  cells in male type II pneumocytes, with preliminary evidence that type II pneumocytes of all lung epithelial cell types showed the highest expression of ACE2. These results raise the possibility that sex differences in ACE2 expression and the presence of doublepositive cells 19.	0

2150	Background: Current outbreaks of COVID 19 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. Control measures, based on isolation and quarantine, have been shown to decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing COVID 19 epidemic, recent modelling work shows that this intervention technique may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. Furthermore, the effect of infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with a significant proportion of asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. Antivirals, which decrease the viral load and reduce the infectiousness, could be integrated in the control measures in order to augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic. Methods: Using a simulation based model of viral transmission we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures for the control of COVID 19. For individuals that were identified through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset and testing of individuals. Moreover, we investigate the effect of a potent antiviral compound on the contact tracing process. Findings: The use of an antiviral drug, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, results in a significant decrease of the final size, the peak incidence, and increases the probability that the outbreak will fade out. Interpretation: For an infectious disease in which presymptomatic infections are plausible, an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when realized together with testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. In addition, in all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of the administration of an antiviral drug in addition to quarantine, isolation and contact tracing. The resulting control measure, could be an effective strategy to control local and re emerging outbreaks of COVID 19.	0
2151	SARS CoV 2 enters cells using its Spike protein, which is also the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, assays to measure how antibodies and sera affect Spikemediated viral infection are important for studying immunity. Because SARS CoV 2 is a biosafetylevel 3 virus, one way to simplify such assays is to pseudotype biosafety level 2 viral particles with Spike. Such pseudotyping has now been described for single cycle lentiviral, retroviral and VSV particles, but the reagents and protocols are not widely available. Here we detail how to effectively pseudotype lentiviral particles with SARS CoV 2 Spike and infect 293T cells engineered to express the SARS CoV 2 receptor, ACE2. We also make all the key experimental reagents available in the BEI Resources repository of ATCC and the NIH. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these pseudotyped lentiviral particles can be used to measure the neutralizing activity of human sera or plasma against SARS CoV 2 in convenient luciferase based assays, thereby providing a valuable neutralization.	0

The spread of novel coronavirus (COVID 19) across the globe and the associated morbidity and mortality challenged the nations by several means. One such under recognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic.
Materials and methods
This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID 19 pandemic. The literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020 April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review.
A review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID 19. Several socio demographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID 19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW.

2157	The fast spreading of the novel coronavirus COVID 19 has aroused worldwide interest and concern, and caused more than one million and a half confirmed cases to date. To combat this spread, medical imaging such as computed tomography (CT) images can be used for diagnostic. An automatic detection tools is necessary for helping screening COVID 19 pneumonia using chest CT imaging. In this work, we propose a multitask deep learning model to jointly identify COVID 19 patient and segment COVID 19 lesion from chest CT images. Our motivation is to leverage useful information contained in multiple related tasks to help improve both segmentation and classification performances. Our architecture is composed by an encoder and two decoders for reconstruction and segmentation, and a multi layer perceptron for classification. The proposed model is evaluated and compared with other image segmentation and classification techniques using a dataset of 1044 patients including 449 patients with COVID 19, 100 normal ones, 98 with lung cancer and 397 of different kinds of pathology. The obtained results show very encouraging performance of our method with a dice coefficient higher than 0.78 for the segmentation and classification.	0

2159	The rise of the World Airline Network over the past century has lead to sharp changes in our notions of 'distance' and 'closeness'  both in terms of trade and travel, but also (less desirably) with respect to the spread of disease. Using flight data from the WAN, along with a drastically simplified epidemic model, we are able to predict epidemic arrival times, for arbitrary initial conditions, in a computationally efficient manner. Our framework provides some theoretical justification to the 'effective distance' originally introduced by Brockmann & Helbing (2013), however we also observed that the predictive power of such heuristics is significantly lower than previously reported. Further improvements to our framework allow predictions to be made, even which this class of methods can be expected to fail.	1
2160	"We have analyzed the COVID19 epidemic data of more than 174 countries (excluding China) in the period between January 22 and March 28, 2020. We found that some countries (such as the US, the UK, and Canada) follow an exponential epidemic growth, while others (like Italy and several other European countries) show a power law like growth. At the same time, regardless of the best fitting law, most countries can be shown to follow a trajectory similar to that of Italy, but with varying degrees of delay. We found that countries with ""younger"" epidemics tend to exhibit more exponential like behavior, while countries that are closer behind Italy tend to follow a power law growth. We hypothesize that there is a universal growth pattern of this infection that starts off as exponential and subsequently becomes more power law like. Although it cannot be excluded that this growth pattern is a consequence of social distancing measures, an alternative explanation is that it is an intrinsic epidemic growth law, dictated by a spatially distributed community structure, where the growth in individual highly mixed communities is exponential but the longer term, local geographical spread (in the absence of global mixing) results in a power law. This is supported by computer simulations of a metapopulation model that gives rise to predictions about the growth dynamics that are consistent with correlations found in the epidemiological data. Therefore, seeing a deviation from straight exponential growth may not be a consequence of working nonpharmaceutical interventions (except for, perhaps, restricting the air travel). Instead, this is a normal course of raging infection spread. On the practical side, this cautions us against overly optimistic interpretations of the countries epidemic development and emphasizes recommendations."	0
2161	"Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2; coronavirus disease 2019, COVID 19) has emerged, rapidly spreading and severely straining the capacity of the global health community.
Many nations are employing combinations of containment and mitigation strategies, where early diagnosis of COVID 19 is vital in controlling illness progression and limiting viral spread within the population. Thus, rapid and accurate methods of early detection are vital to contain COVID 19 and prevent further spread and predicted subsequent infectious waves of viral recurrence in future. Immediately after its initial characterization, Chinese and American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) rapidly employed molecular assays for detection of COVID 19, mostly employing real time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) methods. However, such methods require specific expensive items of equipment and highly trained analysts, requiring upwards of 4 8 hours to process. These requirements coupled with associated financial pressures may prevent effective deployment of such diagnostic tests. Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is method of nucleic acid amplification which exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity are significantly rapid, and do not require expensive reagents or instruments, which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection.
Studies have shown the successful application of LAMP assays in various forms to detect coronavirus RNA in patient samples, demonstrating that 1 10 copies of viral RNA template per reaction are sufficient for successful detection, ~100 fold more sensitive than conventional RT PCR methods. Importantly, studies have also now demonstrated the effectiveness of LAMP methodology in the detection of SARS CoV 2 RNA at significantly low levels, particularly following numerous improvements to LAMP assay protocols. We hypothesise that recent advancements in enhanced LAMP protocols assay perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of COVID 19, without the requirement of specialized equipment and highly trained professionals to interpret results. Herein, we present 3 our arguments with a view to disseminate such findings, to assist the combat of this virus that is proving so devastating. We hope that this strategy could be applied rapidly, and confirmed for viability with clinical samples, before being rolled out for mass diagnostic testing in these current times."	0

Predictors of the incidence of all cause mortality and deaths due to diabetes and renal diseases among patients newly prescribed antihypertensive agents: A cohort study ☆ , ☆☆ Background: Randomized trials have shown that the major antihypertensive drug classes are similarly effective to reduce mortality, but whether these drug class difference exists in clinical practice has been scarcely explored. This study evaluated the association between antihypertensive drug class, all cause mortality and deaths due to diabetes or renal disease in real life clinical settings. Methods: A clinical database in Hong Kong included all patients who were prescribed their first ever antihypertensive agents between 2001 and 2005 from the public healthcare sector. All patients were followed up for five years, and grouped according to the initial antihypertensive prescription. The associations between antihypertensive drug class, all cause mortality or combined diabetes and renal mortality, respectively, were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard models. Results: From 218,047 eligible patients, 33,288 (15.3%) died within five years after their first ever antihypertensive prescription and among which 1055 patients (0.48%) died of diabetes or renal disease. After adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic status, service settings, district of residence, medication adherence, and the number of comorbidities, each drug class was similarly likely to be associated with mortality due to diabetes or renal disease [Adjusted Hazard Ratios (AHR) ranged from 0.92 to 1.73, p = 0.287 0.939] and all cause mortality (AHR ranged from 0.83 to 1.02) except for beta blockers (AHR = 0.815, 95% C.I. 0.68 0.87, p = 0.024) when ACEI was used as a reference group in propensity score adjusted analysis. Conclusions: These findings provide real life evidence reinforcing that any major antihypertensive drug class is suitable as a first line agent for management of hypertension as recommended by international guidelines."	0

2164	Cases of a novel coronavirus were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and have since spread across the world. Epidemiological studies have indicated human to human onset, admission, and confirmation), and travel history. The generation of detailed, real time, and robust data for emerging disease outbreaks is important and can help to generate robust evidence that will support and inform public health decision making.	1
2165	A mathematical model is developed to study the spread of the COVID 19 epidemics in France. Data from French Public Agency of Health are considered to calibrate the model. The spread of the epidemics strongly depends on confinement measures. The aim of the paper is to predict the evolution of the epidemics under various scenarios that could be taken to quit confinement. The spread of the disease and its re emergence strongly depends on these scenarios.	0
2166	Epidemic parameters are estimated through Bayesian inference using the daily fatality counts in Mumbai during the period from March 31 to April 14. A doubling time of 5.5 days (median with [4.6, 6.9] days 95% CrI) is observed. In the SEIR model this gives the basic reproduction rate R0 of 3.4 (median with [2.4, 4.8] 95% CrI). Using as input the infection fatality rate and the interval between infection and death, the number of infections in Mumbai is inferred. It is found that the ratio of the number of test positives to the total infections is 0.13% (median), implying that tests are currently finding 1 out of 750 cases of infection. After correcting for different testing rates, this result is compatible with a measurement of the ratio made recently via serological testing in the USA. From the estimates of the number of infections we infer that the first COVID 19 cases were seeded in Mumbai between late December 2019 and early February 2020. provided the doubling times remained unchanged since then. We remark on some public health implications if the rate of growth cannot be controlled in about a week. TIFR/TH/20 11	0
2167	"Objective: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID 19 and in hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in Wuhan, China.
The outcomes of patients with severe COVID 19 pneumonia after IHCA over a 40 day period were retrospectively evaluated. Between January 15 and February 25, 2020, data for all cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts for IHCA that occurred in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, China were collected according to the Utstein style. The primary outcome was restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and the secondary outcomes were 30 day survival, and neurological outcome.
Results: Data from 136 patients showed 119 (87.5%) patients had a respiratory cause for their cardiac arrest, and 113 (83.1%) were resuscitated in a general ward. The initial rhythm was asystole in 89.7%, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in 4.4%, and shockable in 5.9%. Most patients with IHCA were monitored (93.4%) and in most resuscitation (89%) was initiated <1 min. The average length of hospital stay was 7 days and the time from illness onset to hospital admission was 10 days. The most frequent comorbidity was hypertension (30.2%), and the most frequent symptom was shortness of breath (75%). Of the patients receiving CPR, ROSC was achieved in 18 (13.2%) patients, 4 (2.9%) patients survived for at least 30 days, and one patient achieved a favourable neurological outcome at 30 days. Cardiac arrest location and initial rhythm were associated with better outcomes.
Conclusion: Survival of patients with severe COVID 19 pneumonia who had an in hospital cardiac arrest was poor in Wuhan. Available online xxx 0300 9572/"	0

2171	During an epidemic, metrics such as R 0 , doubling time, and case fatality rates are important in understanding and predicting the course of an epidemic. However, if collected over country or regional scales, these metrics hide important smaller scale, local dynamics. We examine how commonly used epidemiological metrics differ for each individual state within the United States during the initial COVID 19 outbreak. We found that the case number, and trajectory of cases, differs considerably between states. We show particular, restricting restaurant operations was correlated with increased doubling times. Although individual states are clearly not independent, they can serve as small, natural experiments in how different demographic patterns and government responses can impact the course of an epidemic.	1

2173	Objective: To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus from information on 28 infector infectee pairs. Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID 19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID 19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.	0

Le virome humain est une représentation exhaustive des virus capables d'infecter l'homme. Cette dénomination regroupe bien sûr les virus eucaryotes responsables d'infections aiguës, d'infections chroniques et d'infections latentes, qu'elles soient symptomatiques ou non, mais également les virus procaryotes en raison de leurs rôles sur les communautés bactériennes hébergées dans les flores humaines. Certains auteurs incluent également les séquences virales endogènes conservées dans le génome humain au cours de l'évolution. Les techniques récentes de séquençage profond à haut débit ont permis de mieux caractériser le virome humain. Ces approches ont permis la description de nombreux nouveaux virus et également confirmé que les différents tissus humains arborent de manière asymptomatique une diversité virale importante qui peut être assimilée à une « flore virale ». Cette nouvelle vision des virus nécessite de reconsidérer le rôle biologique des virus dans l'organisme.

2175	Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses from common cold all the way up to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which are known to cause severe respiratory and intestinal illnesses. After cases have been reported from the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries, and due to the high level of movement between China and these countries, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control emphasized the importance to have an entry and exit screening for travelers, including symptoms and thermal screenings as a method to detect and isolate positive cases [20].	1
2176	"Analysis of genetic sequence data from the pandemic SARS Coronavirus 2 can provide 18 insights into epidemic origins, worldwide dispersal, and epidemiological history. With few 19 exceptions, genomic epidemiological analysis has focused on geographically distributed data sets 20 with few isolates in any given location. Here we report an analysis of 20 whole SARS CoV 2 21 genomes from a single relatively small and geographically constrained outbreak in Weifang, 22 People's Republic of China. Using Bayesian model based phylodynamic methods, we estimate the 23 reproduction number for the outbreak to be 2.6 (95% CI:1.5 5). We further estimate the number of 24 infections through time and compare these estimates to confirmed diagnoses by the Weifang 25 Centers for Disease Control. We find that these estimates are consistent with reported cases and 26 there is unlikely to be a large undiagnosed burden of infection over the period we studied. 27 28 194

2180	"We use a simple SIR like epidemic model which integrates known age contact patterns for the United States to model the effect of age targeted mitigation strategies for a COVID 19 like epidemic. We find that, among strategies which end with population immunity, strict age targeted mitigation strategies have the potential to greatly reduce mortalities and ICU utilization for natural parameter choices.
There is currently a shortage of publicly available COVID 19 modeling which considers strict but age targeted mitigation strategies in particular, strategies which may divide the labor force into low risk and high risk groups.
In this paper, we use a simple age sensitive SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Removed) model integrating known age interaction contact patterns to examine the potential effects of age heterogeneous mitigations on an epidemic in a COVID 19 like parameter regime. Our goal is to demonstrate the qualitative point that for an epidemic with COVID 19 like parameters, age sensitive mitigations can result in considerably less mortality and ICU usage than homogeneous mitigations, among strategies which end with population immunity.
We model mitigations which result in a 70% reduction in transmission rates among all of the population except for a relaxed group. In our models, natural transmission rates correspond to an R 0 of 2.7. (In Section 5, we consider other parameter choices.) We consider relaxation strategies based on age thresholds; for example, relaxing restrictions on all people under 50. Because people of different ages often live in the same household, and because other risk factors might also be used to inform mitigation efforts, we consider strategies where only some fraction of people under the age threshold are subject to relaxed restrictions.
Related work has in the context of MERS can be found in [5] , and for H1N1 swine flu in [1].
We use a simple SIR like model acting on n age groups. Let I(t), S(t), R(t), M (t) be vector valued functions of time, each vector of length n, where the jth coordinate of each of I(t), S(t), R(t), and M (t), respectively, denote the the number of people in the jth age group who are infected, susceptible, recovered, or deceased at time t. We let C be the age group contact matrix. This is a symmetric matrix describing the frequency of transmission events between age groups, relative to the products of the population sizes. (In particular, even if the sizes of age groups vary, C would be a constant matrix if we assumed people were equally likely to have have transmission interactions regardless of age.) The constant α is the total recovery/removal rate, and the vector δ = (δ 1 , . . . , δ n ) gives the death rate for each group separately."	0

This study aims to describe the impact of these control measures on the spread of the disease for Italy and Germany, forecast the epidemic trend of COVID 19 in both countries and estimate the medical capacity requirements in terms of hospital beds and intensive care units (ICUs) for optimal clinical treatment of severe and critical COVID 19 patients, for the Germany health system.
We used an exponential decline function to model the trajectory of the daily growth rate of infections in Italy and Germany. A linear regression of the logarithmic growth rate functions of different stages allowed to describe the impact of the ""social distancing"" measures leading to a faster decline of the growth rate in both countries. We used the linear model to predict the number of diagnosed and fatal COVID 19 cases from April 10 th until May 31 st .

2187	A novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019 nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019 nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019 nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019 nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2 Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The ACE2 Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action. The sequence of the ACE2 Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).	0

2189	Italy, which has been hard hit by the COVID 19 pandemic, has an overriding national strategy, but its 21 regions have adapted their response based on the organization of their curative and public health services. In this paper, we compare outcomes for two northern Italian regions which had primary care physicians and hospital care, and Veneto, which focused on community based diagnosis and care.	1
2190	"This study shows that the disease free equilibrium ( ) for COVID 19 coronavirus does not satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability. This implies that as a pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID 19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised the Basic Reproductive number ( 0 < 1) by Equation (33) shows that there is a chance of decline of secondary infections when the ratio between the incidence rate in the population and the total number of infected population quarantined with observatory procedure.
The effort to evaluate the disease equilibrium shows that unless there is a dedicated effort from government, decision makers and stakeholders, the world would hardly be reed of the COVID 19 coronavirus and further spread is eminent and the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery because of the absence of vaccine at the moment."	1
2191	"J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 2 Version française Les cinq continents sont maintenant touchés par la pandémie de Covid 19, et certains états ont décidé d'un confinement plus ou moins contraignant pour essayer de limiter la diffusion de la maladie d'un individu à l'autre. Comités scientifiques En France, alors qu'un conseil scientifique présidé par le professeur Jean François Delfraissy (président, par ailleurs, du Comité Consultatif National d'Éthique) existe depuis le 12 mars [1] un second comité a été institué le 24 mars : le CARE (Comité analyse, recherche et expertise) [2]. Cette nouvelle instance comprend 12 chercheurs et médecins, et a pour charge de conseiller le gouvernement sur les traitements et les tests à mettre en oeuvre contre le Covid 19. Ce comité est présidé par le professeur Françoise Barré Sinoussi, virologue à l'Institut Pasteur, directrice de recherche émérite à l'INSERM, et lauréate du prix Nobel de médecine en 2008 pour son rôle dans la découverte du VIH. Ces deux instances ont donc uniquement un rôle consultatif vis à vis des autorités politiques, et cette fonction trouve place dans un contexte très tendu en France  comme dans toute l'Europe, où le pic de l'épidémie n'a pas encore été atteint partout. Déjà épuisés, et sachant, par le modèle italien, la gravité des cas à venir dans un temps très proche, les soignants réclament déjà à l'exécutif un confinement total pour limiter au maximum la crise sanitaire. Saisi en urgence, le Conseil d'État s'est prononcé contre cette mesure dans sa décision du 22 mars [3]. Risque psychologique du confinement Mais ce confinement, même incomplet, n'est pas sans risque, notamment chez les populations vulnérables, en situation de dépendance, pour lesquelles il sera bien plus difficile à vivre (ou survivre ?) à cette crise. On parle bien ici d'une vulnérabilité à multiples visages : physique, psychique ou sociale. Toute conduite addictive (qu'elle soit centrée sur l'alcool ou sur l'usage de stupéfiants) ajoute encore un risque supplémentaire à cette situation de confinement. Les Page 3 of 12 J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 3 individus, déjà en vase clos, vont tendance à aggraver leur angoisse de projection vers l'avenir et doubler celle ci d'un stress alimentaire, économique, etc. Le danger est évidemment pour l'individu lui même (risque dépressif, suicidaire, …) mais aussi pour son entourage (aggravation des violences intra familiales vis à vis des proches : enfants, conjointe, etc.) [4].
Pour aider les malades et leurs familles pendant cette crise sanitaire, le président de la République a aussi annoncé, après avoir rencontré des représentants des cultes, la mise en place prochaine d'une cellule d'écoute psychologique et spirituelle sous la forme d'un numéro gratuit [5].

2198	Research significance: During the epidemic prevention and control period, our study can be helpful in prognosis, diagnosis and screening for the patients infected with COVID 19 (the novel coronavirus) based on breathing characteristics. According to the latest clinical research, the respiratory pattern of COVID 19 is different from the respiratory patterns of flu and the common cold. One significant symptom that occurs in the COVID 19 is Tachypnea. People infected with COVID 19 have more rapid respiration. Our study can be utilized to distinguish various respiratory patterns and our device can be preliminarily put to practical use. Demo videos of this method working in situations of one subject and two subjects can be downloaded online (https://doi.org/10.6084/ m9.figshare.11493666.v1). This paper has been submitted to IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) 2020, and its extended version is submitted to IEEE Internet of Things journal. Research details: Accurate detection of the unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of people in a remote and unobtrusive manner has great significance. In this work, we innovatively capitalize on depth camera and deep learning to achieve this goal. The challenges in this task are twofold: the amount of real world data is not enough for training to get the deep model; and the intra class variation of different types of respiratory patterns is large and the outer class variation is small. In this paper, considering the characteristics of actual respiratory signals, a novel and efficient Respiratory Simulation Model (RSM) is first proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce real world data. Subsequently, we first apply a GRU neural network with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI AT GRU) to classify	0

2201	In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) has been identified to cause acute respiratory disease in humans. An outbreak of this disease has been reported in mainland China with the city of Wuhan as the recognized epicenter. The disease has also been exported to other countries, including the Philippines, but the level of spread is still under control (as of 08 February 2020). To describe and predict the dynamics of the disease, several preliminary mathematical models are formulated by various international study groups. Here, the insights that can be drawn from these models are discussed, especially as inputs for designing strategies to control effectiveness.	0

2204	We developed a mathematical model to describe the transmission of new coronavirus in the São Paulo State, Brazil. The model divided a community in subpopulations comprised by young and elder persons, in order to take into account higher risk of fatality among elder persons with severe CoViD 19. From data collected in the São Paulo State, we estimated the transmission and additional mortality rates, from which we calculated the basic reproduction number R 0 . From estimated parameters, estimation of the deaths due to CiViD 19 was three times lower than those found in literature. Considering isolation as a control mechanism, we varied isolation rates of young and elder persons in order to assess their epidemiological impacts. The epidemiological scenarios focused mainly on evaluating the number of severe CoViD 19 cases and deaths due to this disease when isolation is introduced in a population.	0
2205	Background and aims: COVID 19 is already a pandemic. Emerging data suggest an increased association and a heightened mortality in patients of COVID 19 with comorbidities. We aimed to evaluate the outcome in hypertensive patients with COVID 19 and its relation to the use of renin angiotensin system blockers (RASB). Methods: We have systematically searched the medical database up to March 27, 2020 and retrieved all the published articles in English language related to our topic using MeSH key words. Results: From the pooled data of all ten available Chinese studies (n ¼ 2209) that have reported the characteristics of comorbidities in patients with COVID 19, hypertension was present in nearly 21%, followed by diabetes in nearly 11%, and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) in approximately 7% of patients. Although the emerging data hints to an increase in mortality in COVID 19 patients with known hypertension, diabetes and CVD, it should be noted that it was not adjusted for multiple confounding factors. Harm or benefit in COVID 19 patients receiving RASB has not been typically assessed in these studies yet, although mechanistically and plausibly both, benefit and harm is possible with these agents, given that COVID 19 expresses to tissues through the receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Conclusion: Special attention is definitely required in patients with COVID 19 with associated comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and established CVD. Although the role of RASB has a mechanistic equipoise, patients with COVID 19 should not stop these drugs at this point of time, as recommended provider.	0

2209	Since December 2019, the world is potentially facing one of the most difficult infectious situations of the last decades. COVID 19 epidemic warrants consideration as a mass casualty incident (MCI) of the highest nature. An optimal MCI/disaster management should consider all four phases of the so called disaster cycle: mitigation, planning, response, and recovery. COVID 19 outbreak has demonstrated the worldwide unpreparedness to face a global MCI. This present paper thus represents a call for action to solicitate governments and the Global Community to actively start effective plans to promote and improve MCI management preparedness 19.	1

2211	"The 2019 nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS CoV according to the updated findings. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility. Besides, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019 nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we also constructed Protein protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion.

2212	In the midst of pandemic for respiratory illness, the call for non pharmaceutical interventions become the highest priority for infectious disease and public health experts, while the race towards vaccine or medical intervention are ongoing. Individuals may modify their behavior and take preventative steps to reduce infection risk in the bid to adhere to the call by government officials and experts. As a result, the existence of relationship between the preliminary and the final transmission rates become feeble. This study evaluates the behavioral changes (mitigation and suppression measures) proposed by public health experts for COVID 19 which had altered human behavior and their day to day lives. The dynamics underlying the mitigation and suppression measures reduces the contacts among citizens and significantly interfere with their physical and social behavior. The results show all the measures have a significant impact on the decline of transmission rate. However, the mitigation measures might prolong the elimination of the transmission which might lead to a severe economic meltdown, yet, a combination of the measures show a possibility of rooting out transmission within 30 days if adhered to in an extreme manner. The result shows a peak period of infection for Ghana ranges from 64 th day to 74 th day of infection time period.	0
2213	"In recent years nidoviruses have emerged as an important respiratory pathogen of reptiles, 29 affecting especially captive python populations. In pythons, nidovirus infection induces an 30 inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe and 31 often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions 32 in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30 33 nidovirus RT PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain.
34
The observations prompted us to study whether the atypical tissue tropism associates with 35 previously unknown nidoviruses or changes in the nidovirus genome. RT PCR and inoculation 36 of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and to obtain virus isolates. 37 Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against nidovirus nucleoprotein 38 demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelial (respiratory and 39 alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular 40 monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next generation sequencing we 41 obtained full length genome for a novel nidovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of 42 viral genomes recovered from pythons showing nidovirus infection associated respiratory or 43 systemic disease did not explain the observed phenotypes. The results indicate that python 44 nidoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection 45 could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a 46 consequence of monocyte mediated systemic spread of the virus. 47 48 author/funder.

Nidoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and 51 can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from 52 previously evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the 53 entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a 54 variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise 55 important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS CoV and SARS CoV, as well as the recently 56 emerged SARS CoV 2. Python nidoviruses belong to the same subfamily as the mentioned 57 human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal 58 tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better 59 understand the complexity of viruses of the order permission."	0
2214	"We aimed to audit the prescribing practice on a busy 14 bedd general ICU, and develop standardised practices and tools to improve safety. Prescribing errors occur as commonly as in 10% of UK hospital admissions, costing 8.5 extra bed days per admission, and costing the National Health Service an estimated £1 billion per annum [1]. The majority of these mistakes are avoidable [2]. Methods We audited the daily infusion charts of all patients in three separate spot checks, over 1 week. We assessed all aspects of prescriptions that make them legal and valid, in accordance with national guidance [3]. New procedures were introduced, which included a standardised prescription sticker, with common, preprinted, infusion prescriptions on (noradrenaline, propofol, and so forth), and education on using the new prescription stickers. A month later the audit process was repeated.
We assessed 129 prescriptions in the fi rst round, and 111 after intervention, demonstrating a 70% improvement in safe prescribing. Only 24% of prescriptions initially fulfi lled best practice criteria, improving to 94% afterwards. We also reduced the number of infusions running without prescription, 7 (6%) versus 24 (19%). See Figures 1 and 2 . Conclusion Our audit supports the need for standardised prescribing practices within critical care, especially when dealing with potentially harmful vasoactive/sedative drugs. With a small, cost eff ective intervention (£20 for 6,200 stickers), we improved prescribing accuracy, and thus patient safety in intensive care.

Results Mock thefts were successfully accomplished on six occasions over a 4 week period. On each occasion the Limpet photographed the 'thief' and recorded the date and time of access. Therefore, in the event of a real theft it would be possible to quickly and easily indentify the culprit. Conclusion When CDs are missing it can be extremely stressful for the staff involved. Those who have access to CDs may feel unfairly scrutinised and the potential for false accusation exists. Investigating the theft of CDs is costly and usually involves pharmacists, managers and the police. Until the issue is resolved, potential suspects are usually suspended from work, leading to disruptions in patient care. The utility of the Limpet in modifying staff behaviour by reducing the number of occasions and the duration of time that open drug cupboards are left unattended, has previously been demonstrated [1]. By providing the facility to determine exactly who accessed each CD cupboard at which time, this initial study has shown the benefi ts of the Limpet as a tool for detecting theft. Therefore the installation of the Limpet mitigates the diffi culties of investigating CD theft and is likely to prove an eff ective deterrent. Reference 1.

Résumé L'objectif de cette revue est de présenter une analyse bibliographique de la littérature de ces cinq dernières années concernant les pneumonies aiguës communautaires (PAC) et les exacerbations aiguës de bronchopneumopathies chroniques obstructives (EABPCO). La PAC et l'EABPCO sont des pathologies fréquentes grevées d'une mortalité et/ou morbidité encore élevée de nos jours. La connaissance des facteurs de risque d'évolution compliquée et l'identification des signes de gravité souvent liés au risque de mortalité permettent d'orienter le patient pour un traitement ambulatoire, en hospitalisation conventionnelle ou en secteur de réanimation ; des règles prédictives ont été établies dans ce sens.

The purpose of this review was to analyze the literature concerning community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) published in the last five years. CAP and AECOPD are frequent diseases that are to this day still associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Patient management, especially the choice of the management environment, outpatient or intensive care, depends on the knowledge and recognition of predictors of complications, mortality risk factors, and severity signs to the extent that predictive algorithms have been established. However, research and publications concerning discharge criteria and follow up of CAP and AECOPD patients is more sparse."	0

2218	Backgrounds: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city in China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and other countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0 , of 2019 nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. Methods: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019 nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (g), we estimated R 0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. Findings: The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R 0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96 2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89 4.39) associated with 8 fold to 2 fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R 0 . Conclusion: The mean estimate of R 0 for the 2019 nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and is significantly larger than outbreaks.	0
2219	To the Editor—An outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID 19), which began in Wuhan, China in the end of 2019,1 has now reached over 100 countries and poses a huge threat to the global public health and economy.2 Given the risk of human to human transmission, the serial interval, which refers to the time interval from symptom onset of a primary case (ie, the infector) to that of a secondary case (ie, the infectee),3 is an essential quantity, in addition to the basic reproduction number, that drives the speed of spread. This result appears slightly but not significantly shorter than the previous estimated ‘intrinsic’ serial interval, with a mean of 7.5 days.1 The mechanism behind the gender difference remains unknown, but it may be partly due to the fact that male cases are more severe than female cases (ie, “officials recorded patients”8).	0

2221	Different ways of calculating mortality ratios during epidemics can yield widely different results, particularly during the COVID 19 pandemic. We formulate both a survival probability model and an associated infection duration dependent SIR model to define individual and population based estimates of dynamic mortality ratios. The key parameters that affect the dynamics of the different mortality estimates are the incubation period and the length of time individuals were infected before confirmation of infection. We stress that none of these ratios are accurately represented by the often misinterpreted case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of deaths to date divided by the total number of infected cases to date. Using available data on the recent SARS CoV 2 outbreaks and simple assumptions, we estimate and compare the different dynamic mortality ratios data.	0

The first classification of viruses as a group distinct from other microorganisms was based on the capacity to pass through filters of a small pore size (filterable agents). Initial subclassifications were based primarily on pathologic properties such as specific organ tropism (e.g., hepatitis viruses) or common epidemiologic features such as transmission by arthropod vectors (e.g., arboviruses).

2227	"Editor  We read with interest the recent study by Zhong and colleagues 1 in the British Journal of Anaesthesia. We would like to thank these authors for sharing their experience of transmission rates to anaesthetists associated with the provision of spinal anaesthesia in patients with COVID 19. These early data are welcome as health care professionals face the challenge of managing the pandemic. However, we suggest that these findings need to be interpreted with caution.
The appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used in different clinical settings has been a source of controversy and confusion. The choice of appropriate PPE frequently hinges around whether the patient contact involves an aerosol generating procedure (AGP), such as tracheal intubation or extubation. This can be particularly difficult in the obstetric population where the majority of operations are performed under neuraxial anaesthesia (not considered to be an AGP), but with the ever present risk of requiring expedient conversion to general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation during surgery. The data presented by Zhong and colleagues suggest that use of level 1 PPE (surgical mask, hat, gown and gloves) for spinal anaesthesia was associated with an elevated risk of COVID 19 transmission to the anaesthetist performing spinal anaesthesia compared to level 3 PPE (N95 mask, hat, goggles, face shield, gloves, protection suits and gowns).
Firstly, with relatively small numbers in a retrospective, observational study, there is an elevated risk of random type 1 error, and the significant finding of reduced chance."	0
2228	A SIRU type epidemic model is proposed for the prediction of COVID 19 spreading within Brasil, and analyse the influence of public health measures on simulating the control of this infectious disease. Since the reported cases are typically only a fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, the model accounts for both reported and unreported cases. Also, the model allows for the time variation of both the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic individuals, so as to reflect public health interventions, towards its control, along the course of the epidemic evolution. An analytical exponential behaviour for the accumulated reported cases evolution is assumed at the onset of the epidemy, for explicitly estimating initial conditions, while a Bayesian inference approach is adopted for parametric estimations employing the present direct problem model with the data from the known portion of the epidemics evolution, represented by the time series for the reported cases of infected individuals. The direct inverse problem analysis is then employed with the actual data from China, with the first half been employed for the parametric estimation and the second half for validation of the predictive capability of the proposed approach. The full dataset for China is then employed in another parameter identification, aimed at refining the values for the average times that asymptomatic infectious individuals and that symptomatic individuals remain infectious. Following this validation, the available data on reported cases in Brasil from February 15 th till March 29 th , 2020, is used for estimating parameters and then predict the epidemy evolution under these conditions. Finally, public health interventions are simulated, aimed at diminishing the effects of the disease spreading, by acting on both the transmission rate and the fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, considering time variable exponential behaviours for these two parameters, usually assumed constant in epidemic evolutions without intervention. It is demonstrated that a combination of actions to affect both parameters can have a much faster and effective result in the control of the epidemy dynamics. : medRxiv preprint the analysis of the impact of public health measures [1], which however did not consider in the modelling the presence of unreported infection cases, which are in practice inherent to this process.

2229	"Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines' availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a medicine shortage. Only in 2019, the EMA and HMA joint task force released the first harmonized ""shortage"" definition in the European Economic Area (EEA) and guidance on public communication. This manuscript aims to review the current European regulatory framework on medicine shortages. To support the activities of regulators, manufacturers and other healthcare professionals, an algorithm was also proposed to be used as a harmonized procedure to determine the shortage/unavailability impact on public health settings."	0
2230	The COVID 19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2, creates an urgent need for identifying molecular mechanisms that mediate viral entry, propagation, and tissue pathology. Cell membrane bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and associated proteases, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and Cathepsin L (CTSL), were previously identified as mediators of SARS CoV2 cellular entry. Here, we assess the cell type specific RNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL through an integrated analysis of 107 single cell and single nucleus RNA Seq studies, including 22 lung and airways datasets (16 unpublished), and 85 datasets from other diverse organs. Joint expression of ACE2 and the accessory proteases identifies specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells as putative targets of viral infection in the nasal passages, airways, and alveoli. Cells that co express ACE2 and proteases are also identified in cells from other organs, some of which have been associated with COVID 19 transmission or pathology, including gut enterocytes, corneal epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, heart pericytes, olfactory sustentacular cells, and renal epithelial cells. Performing the first meta analyses of scRNA seq studies, we analyzed 1,176,683 cells from 282 nasal, airway, and lung parenchyma samples from 164 donors spanning fetal, childhood, adult, and elderly age groups, associate increased levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in specific cell types with increasing age, male gender, and smoking, all of which are epidemiologically linked to COVID 19 susceptibility and outcomes. Notably, there was a particularly low expression of ACE2 in the few young pediatric samples in the analysis. Further analysis reveals a gene expression program shared by ACE2   TMPRSS2   cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues, including genes that may mediate viral entry, subtend key immune functions, and mediate epithelial macrophage cross talk. Amongst these are IL6, its receptor and co receptor, IL1R, TNF response pathways, and complement genes. Cell type specificity in the lung and airways and smoking effects were conserved in mice. Our analyses suggest that differences in the cell type specific expression of mediators of SARS CoV 2 viral entry may be responsible for aspects of COVID 19 epidemiology and clinical course, and point to putative molecular pathways involved in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis.	0

2235	The Eyring's rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions. The susceptible individuals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring's rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R 0 , is not a constant, dependent on the volume fraction of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid 19) transmission and make predictions on peak time, peak infected, and R 0 . Our work provides a simple and straightforward approach to estimate how infection diseases evolve and how many people may be infected.	1

2238	"The SARS CoV 2 coronavirus is driving a global pandemic, but its biological mechanisms are less well understood. SARS CoV 2 is an RNA virus whose multiple genomic and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) transcripts hijack the host cell's machinery, located across distinct cytotopic locations. Subcellular localization of its viral RNA could play important roles in viral replication and host antiviral immune response. Here we perform computational modeling of SARS CoV 2 viral RNA localization across eight subcellular neighborhoods. We compare hundreds of SARS CoV 2 genomes to the human transcriptome and other coronaviruses and perform systematic sub sequence analyses to identify the responsible signals. Using state of the art machine learning models, we predict that the SARS CoV 2 RNA genome and all sgRNAs are enriched in the host mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus. The 5' and 3' viral untranslated regions possess the strongest and most distinct localization signals. We discuss the mitochondrial localization signal in relation to the formation of double membrane vesicles, a critical stage in the coronavirus life cycle. Our computational analysis serves as a hypothesis generation tool to suggest models for SARS CoV 2 biology and inform experimental efforts to combat the virus.
RNA subcellular localization is critical to a myriad of cellular processes (Buxbaum et al., 2015; Chin and Lécuyer, 2017; Ryder and Lerit, 2018) .

2239	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) spread globally in early 2020, causing the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID 19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT scans faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID 19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT scans. In our Inf Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on a COVID 19 infection dataset demonstrate that the proposed Inf Net outperforms most cutting edge segmentation models and advances the state of theart performance.	0

2241	"Airborne transmission is a pathway of contagion that is still not sufficiently investigated despite the 13 evidence in the scientific literature of the role it can play in the context of an epidemic. While the 14 medical research area dedicates efforts to find cures and remedies to counteract the effects of a 15 virus, the engineering area is involved in providing risk assessments in indoor environments by 16
simulating the airborne transmission of the virus during an epidemic. To this end, virus air emission 17 data are needed. Unfortunately, this information is usually available only after the outbreak, based 18 on specific reverse engineering cases. In this work, a novel approach to estimate the viral load 19
emitted by a contagious subject on the basis of the viral load in the mouth, the type of respiratory 20 activity (e.g. breathing, speaking), respiratory physiological parameters (e.g. inhalation rate), and 21 activity level (e.g. resting, standing, light exercise) is proposed. The estimates of the proposed 22
approach are in good agreement with values of viral loads of well known diseases from the 23 literature. The quanta emission rates of an asymptomatic SARS CoV 2 infected subject, with a viral 24 load in the mouth of 10 8 copies mL  1 , were 10.5 quanta h  1 and 320 quanta h  1 for breathing and 25 speaking respiratory activities, respectively, at rest. In the case of light activity, the values would 26 increase to 33.9 quanta h  1 and 1.03×10 3 quanta h  1 , respectively. 27
The findings in terms of quanta emission rates were then adopted in infection risk models to 28 demonstrate its application by evaluating the number of people infected by an asymptomatic SARS 29
CoV 2 subject in Italian indoor microenvironments before and after the introduction of virus 30 containment measures. The results obtained from the simulations clearly highlight that a key role is 31 played by proper ventilation in containment of the virus in indoor environments. 32 33"	0

2244	Several animal cells have been used for vaccine production for years, such as African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells that were used to produce vaccines against polio and rabies, Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells that were employed to manufacture influenza vaccines, and chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) that were used to produce vaccines against measles, mumps, rabies and tick borne encephalitis (Genzel 2015). We aimed to identify the minimally required receptor panel for the possibility of constructing cells that can be infected by a broad range of viruses through categorizing virus entry mechanisms and summarizing receptors mediating the entry process according to Baltimore subtyping, and used typical or well known example viruses to illustrate each summarized entry pathway. PRRs play differential roles on viral identification, i.e. Toll like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR3/7/8/9 recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns, RIG I like receptors (RLRs) including RIG I and MDA5 detect RNA structures, DNA sensors such as cGAS, IFI16, DDX41, DAI and a few DNA damage response proteins identify cytoplasmic DNA (O’Neill and Bowie 2010; Unterholzner 2013; Hornung 2014; Muller et al. Lastly, we would like to mention that establishing a cell line that can be infected by a broad range of viruses not only requires sufficient knowledge and good design of surface receptors, but also needs to ensure rapid virus replication so that they could effectively complete their life cycles in cells.	0

2247	"A newly identified novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) has caused numerous acute respiratory syndrome cases in Wuhan China from December 2019 to Feb 2020. Its fast spreading to other provinces in China and overseas is very likely causing a pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus has been reported to be capable of endangering thousands of lives, it is extremely important to find out how the coronavirus is transmitted in human organs. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in some patients with 2019 nCoV but the significance remains undetermined. The cell receptor angiotensin covering enzyme II (ACE2), which is the major receptor of SARS nCoV, has been reported to be a cellular entry receptor of 2019 nCoV as well. Here, to more precisely explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019 nCoV infections in the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets.
According to the expression profile of ACE2 in colon epithelial cells, we speculate adenoma and colorectal cancer patients are more likely to be infected with 2019 nCoV than healthy people. Our data may provide a theoretical basis for the application."	0

2249	The outbreak of 2019 nCoV pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China has resulted in more than 70,000 laboratory confirmed cases, and recent studies showed that 2019 nCoV (SARS CoV 2) could be of bat origin but involve other potential intermediate hosts. In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sick pangolins. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that pangolin Coronaviruses (pangolin CoV) are genetically related to both the 2019 nCoV and bat Coronaviruses but do not support the 2019 nCoV arose directly from the pangolin CoV. Our study also suggested that pangolin be natural host of Betacoronavirus, with a potential to infect humans. Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins. Conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to minimize the spillover risks of coronaviruses from wild permission.	0
2250	"The SARS CoV 2 epidemic is one of the biggest challenges healthcare systems worldwide have ever had to face. To curb transmission many countries have adopted social distancing measures and travel restrictions. Estimating the effect of these measures in each context is challenging and requires mathematical models of the transmission dynamics. Projections for the future course of the epidemic strongly rely on model predictions and accurate representation of real time data as they accumulate. Here I develop an SEIR modeling framework for Covid 19, to evaluate reported cases and fatalities, and to enable forecasting using evidence based Bayesian parameter estimation. This Bayesian framework offers a tool to parametrize real time dynamics of Covid 19 cases, and explore the effect of control as it unfolds in any setting. I apply the model to Covid 19 data from Albania, where drastic control measures were put in place already on the day of the first confirmed case. Evaluating the dynamics of reported cases 9 31 March 2020, I estimate parameters and make preliminary projections. Three weeks into the measures, Albanian data already indicate a strong signature of more than 40% transmission reduction, and lend support to a progressively increasing effect of control measures rather than a static one. In the Albanian setting, the model and data match well, projecting the peak of the outbreak may be around 5 15 April, and be contained within 300 active confirmed cases if control continues with the same trend. This framework can be used to understand the quantitative effects of different control measures in real time, and inform adaptive intervention for success in other settings.
Albania reported the first confirmed case of coronavirus disease (COVID 19) on the 9th of March 2020. Given very close travel connections with Italy, where the epidemic grew very fast over the month of February, the concern over a major similar outbreak in Albania was significant. Immediately following the first case confirmation, country wide measures were taken to drastically reduce transmission and contain the spread of infection. These included university and school closures, suspension of public gatherings, closure of bars and cafes, travel restrictions, and gradually a lockdown of the population. The parameters governing the epidemic course of COVID 19 in Albania remain unknown. The first week after the first detected case, official numbers indicated case counts amounting to a total 59 confirmed cases on March 18, with two fatalities (Albanian Institute of Public Health). The initial exponential growth rate of the number of cases in Albania was r = 0.17 during the first week, coming from a doubling time of 4 days (1), but this has slowed down from March 14 onward. It is not known what will be the trajectory of the epidemic in this country. Following the diagnosis of the first cases, the borders with Italy, Greece, Kosovo were rapidly closed and many flights to other European destinations were limited or cancelled.
The aim of this study is to provide a framework for interpreting and forecasting the real time course of the epidemic as it unfolds in a given setting. I use the Albanian data as an illustration for the application of the model. With the model and Bayesian estimation, continuously updating values for the parameters, underlying the epidemic course of COVID 19, can be obtained, and continuously updating projections. Based on the model application to Albania, the parameter estimates and their associated uncertainty, suggest clear positive effects of control measures and make precise quantitative projections about the magnitude and timing of the peak of this outbreak in Albania."	0
2251	On February 15, the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine (JSICM), the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM), the Japanese Society of Respiratory Care Medicine (JSRCM), and the Japanese Society of PCPS/ECMO (JSPCPS/ECMO) launched “Japan ECMOnet for COVID 19” as a telephone consultation, treatment support, and a web based real time nationwide registry and surveillance system to discuss COVID 19 patients from over 400 hospitals who may be candidates for ECMO [2]. Selected laboratory data of the patients on admission were as follows: median serum KL 6 (a marker of interstitial pneumonia) was 333 U/mL, LDH was 460 IU/L, and procalcitonin was 0.12 ng/mL. With regard to ECMO settings, the median blood flow was 4 L/min (range 2.5–5.3 L/min), the median size of the draining cannula was 24 Fr (range 21–25 Fr), and the median size of the infusing cannula was 20 Fr (range 16–21 Fr).	0
2252	The cases are centralized in major hospitals, and most However, the situation improved dramatically after taking strict precautions—there is no infection reported among fully equipped healthcare workers who were recruited to support Wuhan province (6200 nationally, 628 from Tianjin) since February 2020.	1
2253	The current practice for diagnosis of SARS CoV 2 infection relies on PCR testing of nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens in a symptomatic patient at high epidemiologic risk. This testing strategy likely underestimates the true prevalence of infection, creating the need for serologic methods to detect infections missed by the limited testing to date. Here, we describe the development of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS CoV 2, in addition to SARS CoV, MERS CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A preliminary study of human sera collected prior to the SARS CoV 2 pandemic demonstrates overall high IgG reactivity to common human coronaviruses and low IgG reactivity to epidemic coronaviruses including SARS CoV 2, with some cross reactivity of conserved antigenic domains including S2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein. This array can be used to answer outstanding questions regarding SARS CoV 2 infection, including whether baseline serology for other coronaviruses impacts disease course, how the antibody response to infection develops over time, and what antigens would be optimal for vaccine development.	1
2254	"Within China, the city of Wuhan along with several others has been shut down, with individuals not allowed to leave the city in an effort to contain the virus; such efforts are largely unprecedented in a city of this size (
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/coronavirus quarantines history.html). In this article, I will outline different potential treatment options that could be pursued as a therapy for 2019 nCoV virus, keeping the focus on agents that could be rapidly tested in patients today and broadly effective in spite of limited knowledge of the biology of 2019 nCoV. Simply stated, there is limited time for basic studies of 2019 nCoV in research labs, while patients need effective therapies today."	1
2255	Under the starvation of serine, the upregulation or enhancement of de novo serine synthesis pathway and oxidative phosphorylation were independent of p53, while the inhibition of nucleotide synthesis was dependent of p53 p21 activation so that the limited amount of de novo serine was shunted to glutathione production for the survival of cancer cells [7]. Although glycine might be important for rapid cancer cell proliferation by supporting de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis [6], glycine restriction alone didn’t have the same detrimental effect on cancer cells as serine starvation, which might be explained by the inter conversion between serine and glycine in one carbon metabolism by serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT) [7, 16, 17], especially the mitochondrial glycine synthesis enzyme SHMT2 [6]. These post translational modifications of lysine and its ERPs regulate the structures and functions of enzymes to expand the functional proteome [36], represent the crosstalk between metabolism and epignome [37], and also link cell signaling and metabolic reconfiguration to cell proliferation and differentiation [38].	0
2256	"Our experiments suggest that GA inhibits virion entry by blocking the initial fusion event. Data showing inhibition of HSV 1 and CMV replication, when GA is administered post infection, suggest a possible secondary mechanism targeting protein and DNA synthesis. Thus, in light of the strong effect of GA on viral infection, even after the infection begins, it may potentially be used to treat acute infections (e.g. Coronavirus, EBOV, ZIKV, IAV and measles), and also topically for the successful treatment of active lesions (e.g. HSV 1, HSV 2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV)).
Ginkgolic acids are alkylphenol constituents of the leaves and fruits of Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo biloba extracts (GBE) have been used as herbal supplements since at least the 16 th century and remain widely in use 1 . Major constituents of GBE include terpine trilactones (ginkgolide A, B, C, J, and bilobalide), flavonoid glycosides (quercetin and rutin), as well as Ginkgolic acids 2 . Ginkgolic acids are a mixture of several 2 hydroxy 6 alkylbenzoic acids in which the most common alkyl chains contain 13, 15, or 17 carbons. The 15 and 17 carbon chains are unsaturated at positions 8 and 10, respectively. The 3 Ginkgolic acid (GA) structures are, therefore, designated C13:0, C15:1, and C17:1 (Table S1) 3 . GA has shown pleiotropic effects in vitro, including: antitumor effects through inhibition of lipogenesis; decreased expression of invasion associated proteins through AMPK activation; potential rescue of amyloid β (Aβ) induced synaptic impairment; and inhibition of HIV protease activity as well as HIV viral replication 4 7 . GA was also reported to have activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus 8 . Several ways in which GA works have been suggested including by SUMOylation inhibition activity; blocking formation of the E1 SUMO intermediate 9 ; inhibition of fatty acid synthase 10 ; non specific SIRT inhibition 11 ; and activation of protein phosphatase type 2C 12 .
Here we report that GA shows antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV 1), Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) primarily through viral fusion inhibition. In addition, we show inhibition of entry of a replication defective non enveloped adenovirus. The antiviral effects were observed below the cytotoxic threshold. We believe that broad spectrum antiviral activity is achieved through the inhibition of viral entry and that this effect could be therapeutically utilized systemically in the context of severe acute viral disease,"	0

Yet, data 20 streaming, while considerably visualized, is not accompanied with advanced modelling techniques to provide real time insights. This study introduces a unified platform which integrates visualization capabilities with advanced statistical methods for predicting the virus spread in the short run, using real time data. The platform is backed up by advanced time series models to capture any possible non linearity in the data which is enhanced by the capability of 25 measuring the expected impact of preventive interventions such as social distancing and lockdowns.

2261	In the COVID 19 coronavirus pandemic, currently vaccines and specific anti viral treatment are not yet available. Thus, by case isolation, quarantine, and social distancing is essential to slowing its spread. Here we model social networks using weighted graphs, where vertices represent individuals and edges represent contact. As public health measures are implemented, connectivity in the graph decreases, resulting in lower effective reproductive numbers, and reduced viral transmission. For COVID 19, model parameters were derived from the coronavirus epidemic in China, validated by epidemic data in Italy, then applied to the United States. We calculate that, in the U.S., the public is able to contain viral transmission by limiting the average number of contacts per person to less than 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. This increases the average social distance between individuals to 10 degrees of separation.	1

2264	"Determining the severity of a novel pathogen in the early stages is difficult in the absence of reliable data. The pattern of outbreaks for COVID 19 across the globe have differed markedly above and below  40ºN latitudes, suggesting very different levels of severity, but countries worldwide have implemented the same lockdown strategies. Existing methods for estimating severity appear not to have been useful in informing strategic decisions, possibly due to mismatches between the data required and those available, overly sophisticated methods with undesirable biases, or perhaps confusion and uncertainly generated by the wide range of estimates these methods produced early on.
The Epidemic Severity Index (ESI) is a simple, robust method for estimating the local severity of novel epidemic outbreaks using early and widely available data and that does not depend on any estimated values. ESI allows rapid, meaningful comparisons across territories that can be tracked as the outbreaks unfold. The ESI quantifies severity relative to a parameterised baseline rather than attempting to estimate values for infection fatality rates, case fatality rates or transmission rates. The relative nature of the ESI sidesteps any problems of confidence value."	0
2265	Two months after it was firstly reported, the novel coronavirus disease COVID 19 has already spread worldwide. However, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in China. To assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in China, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in unfolding.	1

Blood donation is critical to all of transfusion therapy, as it provides the starting product. In the United States and many other economically developed nations, all of the blood is given by volunteer, nonremunerated donors. Donated whole blood is then made into transfusable components, which include but are not limited to packed red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, and frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate. Other lesser utilized blood components, such as granulocytes and cryoprecipitate depleted plasma, also have important therapeutic value. Individual plasma proteins, such as factor VIII, have been manufactured using recombinant methods for years; however, there is no commercial product, single or combined, with the clinical properties of frozen plasma. Each of these components make possible an extraordinary number of traditional and state of the art medical therapies, including trauma surgery, organ transplantation, and cancer chemotherapy. At the time of this writing, there are no clinically effective or available substitutes for RBCs, platelets, or plasma in the United States.
In 2001, the National Blood Donor Resource Center estimated that 8 million volunteer U.S. blood donors contributed approximately 15 million whole blood donations per year, the majority of which were manufactured into separate components, such as RBCs, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. 1 These components allowed transfusion of 29 million blood components in the United States. Thus, in the United States, the average volunteer blood donor gives blood about 1.6 times a year. Of that total, almost 2% represent donations indicated for a specific recipient other than the donor. These are generally referred to as directed or designated donations. In addition, approximately 3% of blood donations are autologous: blood that is donated by an individual for his or her own use, usually for a prescheduled elective surgery. 2 4 Although it is estimated that 60% of the adult population in the United States is eligible to donate blood, at present it is believed that less than 5% of the eligible population donates within any given year. 5,6 The various reasons that some people give blood readily and others do not have been studied for several decades, but the blood donation process and applicable statistics during this time have changed little, if at all.
Blood donation can be divided into five processes that are directly related to the donor: recruitment, screening, physical examination, collection, and post donation care.
Recruitment of blood donors is a specialized task. It is often performed by telerecruiters, and the message delivered must be convincing and compelling to result in a scheduled appointment to donate blood.
Once a donor has been recruited, the screening process is carried out to make sure that the donation process will be safe for the donor and that the collected blood will be safe for the recipient. The prospective donor is initially given information about criteria for eligibility for blood donation and about the process itself. The screening process consists of a questionnaire that seeks to find medical conditions and behaviors that might make donation unsafe for the donor or recipient. Critical information is confirmed by direct verbal questioning to ensure that the answers are accurate. If no disqualifying information is uncovered during the screening process, a brief physical examination follows, which includes examination of antecubital veins, followed by measurement of body temperature, donor hematocrit or hemoglobin, and heart rate.
After the venipuncture is performed, blood is collected, labeled, and temporarily stored until it can be transferred to a manufacturing center for further processing and distribution. Specimen tubes are drawn at the time of collection for infectious disease testing; these tubes are sent for testing immediately after collection.
After the donation, donors receive oral fluids and remain under observation for a period of time so that any post donation reactions may be treated appropriately. Post donation instructions are given to help the donor avoid untoward side effects. The donor is instructed to call the blood center with any post donation information, such as the development of worrisome physical symptoms or information remembered that would change the answers given during the screening process.
Maintaining an adequate blood supply is an ongoing challenge. Attrition of blood donors due to older age and illness, implementation of new regulations resulting in deferrals, or other reasons makes it difficult for blood collection centers to keep pace with the increasing demand for blood. Thus, the recruitment of new blood donors must be ongoing and vigorous. New exclusionary criteria and serologic testing make this task increasingly difficult, as does the fact that newly recruited blood donors are nearly twice as likely to have disqualifying medical conditions as are established blood donors. 7 It is unacceptable to provide volunteer blood donors with monetary compensation (i.e., cash or cash equivalents), so the act of blood donation in the United States is voluntary. Thus, without paying donors for their time and blood, the"	0

These devices can generate large amounts of multimodal data daily that include physiological waveform signals (arterial blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiration), patient alarm messages, numeric vitals data, etc. In order to provide opportunities for increasingly improved patient care, it is necessary to develop an effective data acquisition and analysis system that can assist clinicians and provide decision support at the patient bedside. Previous research has discussed various data collection methods, but a comprehensive solution for bedside data acquisition to analysis has not been achieved. In this paper, we proposed a multimodal data acquisition and analysis system called INSMA, with the ability to acquire, store, process, and visualize multiple types of data from the Philips IntelliVue patient monitor. We also discuss how the acquired data can be used for patient state tracking. INSMA is being tested in the	1
2270	"Managing healthcare demand and capacity is especially difficult in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic, where limited intensive care resources can be overwhelmed by a large number of cases requiring admission in a short space of time. If patients are unable to access this specialist resource, then death is a likely outcome. The aim of this study is to estimate the extent to which such capacity dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand side initiatives involving nonpharmaceutical interventions and supply side measures to increase surge capacity or reduce length of stay.
A stochastic discrete event simulation model is developed to represent the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for COVID 19 patients. Model inputs are aligned to levers available to planners with key outputs including duration of time at maximum capacity (to inform workforce requirements), peak daily deaths (for mortuary planning), and total deaths (as an ultimate marker of intervention efficacy). The model  freely available  is applied to the COVID 19 response at a large hospital in England for which the effect of a number of possible interventions are simulated.
Results. Capacity dependent deaths are closely associated with both the nature and effectiveness of non pharmaceutical interventions and availability of intensive care beds. For the hospital considered, results suggest that capacity dependent deaths can be reduced five fold through a combination of isolation policies, a doubling of bed capacity, and 25% reduced length of stay.
Without treatment or vaccination there is little that can be done to reduce deaths occurring when patients have otherwise been treated in the most appropriate hospital setting. Healthcare planners should therefore focus on minimising the capacity dependent deaths that are within their influence."	0

Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan's 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB's success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals.
Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID 19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days.

2277	"Objectives: Numerous cases of pneumonia of caused by coronavirus disease 2019 were reported in Wuhan, China. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan is highly important in the diagnosis and follow up of lung disease treatment. The present meta analysis was performed to evaluate chest CT findings in COVID 19 patients.
: Finally, 40 eligible studies with 4,183 patients with COVID 19 were used for metaanalysis. The rate of positive chest CT scan in patients with COVID 19 was 94.5% (95%CI: 91.7 96.3). Bilateral lung involvement, pure ground glass opacity (GGO), mixed (GGO pulse consolidation or reticular), consolidation, reticular, and presence of nodule findings in chest CT scan of COVID 19 pneumonia patients were respectively estimated to be 79.1% (95% CI: 70.8 .2). The distribution of lung lesions in patients with COVID 19 pneumonia was peripheral (70.0% [95%CI: 57.8 79.9]), central (3.9% [95%CI: 1.4 10.6]), and peripheral and central (31.1% [95%CI: 19.5 45.8]).

The epidemic has brought not only the risk of death from infection but also unbearable psychological pressure. We sampled college students from Changzhi medical college by using cluster sampling. They responded to a questionnaire packet that included the 7 item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD 7) and those inquiring the participants' basic information. We received 7,143 responses. Results indicated that 0.9% of the respondents were experiencing severe anxiety, 2.7% moderate anxiety, and 21.3% mild anxiety. Moreover, living in urban areas (OR = 0.810, 95% CI = 0.709  0.925), family income stability (OR = 0.726, 95% CI = 0.645  0.817) and living with parents (OR = 0.752, 95% CI = 0.596  0.950) were protective factors against anxiety. Moreover, having relatives or acquaintances infected with COVID 19 was a risk factor for increasing the anxiety of college students (OR = 3.007, 95% CI = 2.377  3.804). Results of correlation analysis indicated that economic effects, and effects on daily life, as well as delays in academic activities, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms (P < .001). However, social support was negatively correlated with the level of anxiety (P < .001). It is suggested epidemics.	0
2282	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is already responsible for far more deaths than previous pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) from 2002 and 2012. The identification of clinically approved drugs to be repurposed to combat 2019 CoV disease (COVID 19) would allow the rapid implementation of potentially lifesaving procedures. The major protease (Mpro) of SARS CoV 2 is considered a promising target, based on previous results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV), an HIV protease inhibitor. However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved antiretroviral protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir (ATV). ATV is of high interest because of its bioavailability within the respiratory tract. Our results show that ATV could dock in the active site of SARS CoV line and primary monocytes, impairing virus induced enhancement of IL 6 and	0
2283	"Background: Iran is one of the countries that has been overwhelmed with COVID 19. We aimed to estimate the total number of COVID 19 related infections, deaths, and hospitalizations in Iran under different physical distancing and isolation scenarios.
We developed a Susceptible Exposed Infected Removed (SEIR) model, parameterized to the COVID 19 pandemic in Iran. We used the model to quantify the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran and assess the effectiveness of isolation and physical distancing under five different scenarios (A: 0% isolation, through E: 40% isolation of all infected cases). We used Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the 95% uncertainty intervals (UI).
Under scenario A, we estimated 5,196,000 (UI 1,753,000  10,220,000) infections to happen till mid June with 966,000 (UI 467,800  1,702,000) hospitalizations and 111,000 (UI 53,400  200,000) deaths. Successful implantation of scenario E would reduce the number of infections by 90% (i.e. 550,000) and change the epidemic peak from 66,000 on June 9 th to 9,400 on March 1 st . Scenario E also reduces the hospitalizations by 92% (i.e. 74,500), and deaths by 93% (i.e. 7,800).
Interpretation: With no approved vaccination or therapy, we found physical distancing and isolation that includes public awareness and case finding/isolation of 40% of infected people can reduce the burden of COVID 19 in Iran by 90% by mid June.
We received no funding for this work."	1
2284	"2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV) is a novel respiratory disease first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019.1 Chinese health officials were originally investigating a sudden increase in cases of pneumonia which were later determined to be linked to 2019 nCoV. While most cases originated within mainland China, the disease spread to neighboring countries including Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, and Japan, and later to the United States, Europe, and Australia. One preliminary, small scale study of 41 patients in Wuhan China, reported 6 deaths (15% mortality) with a median age of 49.0 years.5 Additionally, transmission of the virus has reportedly occurred in healthcare facilities in Wuhan City, raising concerns of spread to healthcare workers, as was seen during prior outbreaks of the novel coronaviruses, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Healthcare workers must follow on going developments related to the outbreak, especially new information concerning detection and management.8,9 The 3I Tool outlined in this paper is consistent with current US CDC guidelines and can be applied in a variety of settings such as those in emergency departments, urgent care clinics, physicians’ offices, and prehospital settings. The mode of transmission has implications for the types of personal protective equipment (PPE) needed to protect healthcare providers in the prehospital, clinic, and hospital settings.25 In addition, patients may need decontamination after exposure to certain toxins.26
Another important consideration for application of the 3I Tool is whether the disease is contagious prior to symptom onset (like measles) or only after symptoms develop (like Ebola)."	0
2285	A novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) has raised world concern since it emerged in Wuhan Hubei China in December, 2019. The infection may result into severe pneumonia with clusters illness onsets. Its impacts on public health make it paramount to clarify the clinical features with other pneumonias.	1
2286	According to a case series of 2143 pediatric patients 3 registered in the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database, 731 cases were confirmed using laboratory testing, 94 (4.4%) patients were asymptomatic, 1091 (50.9%) patients presented with mild symptoms, and 831 (38.8%) patients presented with moderate symptoms. There are other current studies analyzing the drug's efficiency in critically ill patients with a higher risk of death and considering the use of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (5–10 mg/kg/day of basic chloroquine for 10 days) maximum dose of 30 mg/kg or 1,500 mg) 14 16.	1
2287	Besides national and international recommendations, orthopaedic departments face significant changes in daily activity and serious issues to maintain their standards in musculoskeletal care during the pandemic Covid 19 crisis that we are facing. This report retrospectively addresses measures that were progressively put in place to modify in a week time the activity of a busy orthopaedic department in a large tertiary university hospital in face of the pandemic. Surgical priorities and surgical outcomes are key aspects to consider. The experience may offer some insight to areas where the spread of the disease may be slower or delayed. Abrupt stop of scheduled surgery and clinics is useful to adapt an orthopaedic department to the overall hospital resource reorganization. Orthopaedic surgeons need to be aware of the risks to patients and personnel in view of underdiagnosed cases, which make pre operative Covid 19 evaluation mandatory for all surgical cases.	1

Abstract: On 31 December 2019, the Health Commission of Hubei Province of China first unveiled a group of unexplained cases of pneumonia, which WHO subsequently defined as the new coronavirus of 2019 (SARS CoV 2). SARS CoV 2 has presented rapid person to person transmission and is currently a global pandemic. In the largest number of cases described to date of hospitalized patients with SARS CoV 2 disease (2019 nCoViD), 26% required care in an intensive care unit (ICU). This pandemic is causing an unprecedented mobilization of the scientific community, which has been Page 2 of 42 J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f associated with an exponentially growing number of publications in relation to it. This narrative literature review aims to gather the main contributions in the area of intensive care to date in relation to the epidemiology, clinic, diagnosis and management of 2019 nCoViD.
El 31 de diciembre de 2019, la Comisión de Salud de la provincia China de Hubei, dio a conocer por primera vez un grupo de casos inexplicables de neumonía 1 . Se informó que algunos pacientes habían desarrollado procesos neumónicos con cambios radiográficos en vidrio deslustrado; linfopenia y trombopenia; hipoxemia; y alteración de la función hepática y renal 2 . La autoridad sanitaria china comunicó que los pacientes inicialmente dieron negativo en virus respiratorios y bacterias comunes. Posteriormente, estos pacientes dieron positivo para un nuevo coronavirus 3 . El virus fue nombrado por la OMS como el nuevo coronavirus SARS CoV 2, causante de la enfermedad 2019 nCoViD (del inglés, new CoronaVirus Disease). El 13 de marzo de 2020, el Ministerio de Sanidad del Gobierno de España declaraba 4209 casos, con una incidencia acumulada de casos confirmados notificados /100.000 habitantes de 8,99 4 (ver tabla 1).
El SARS CoV 2 tiene una estrecha similitud con los coronavirus de murciélagos y se ha postulado que estos son la fuente de neumonía por coronavirus. Si bien el origen de 2019 nCoViD todavía está siendo investigado, las pruebas actuales sugieren que se produjo su"	0

2291	In December 2019, several patients with pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan, China. On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus, later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV). Genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019 nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus. As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in China and 77 patients in other countries. It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019 nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact. This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread. The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose. Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible or the virus may cause a serious pandemic. Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus. In this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019 nCoV related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and China.	0

2294	"Patients were classified as a group in which blood culture was positive (BC positive group: N = 31) or a group in which blood culture was negative (BC negative group: N = 31).Blood cultures (blood samples were drown from different two sites) were performed immediately after ICU admission due to sepsis or septic shock. Median admission copeptin levels were significantly elevated in non survivors compared to survivors (13.8 pmol/l, IQR 5.9 27.8; vs. 6.3 pmol/l, IQR 4.1 11.5; p < 0.001), Admission copeptin levels were associated with 10 year all cause mortality (age adjusted hazard ratio 1.7 (95%CI, 1.2 2.5); p < 0.001, AUC 0.68). Methods: We analysed a total of 632 consecutive patients with septic shock (sepsis induced hypotension persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation) from the EPOSS database (Data based Evaluation and Prediction of Outcome in Severe Sepsis), which was developed to monitor and assess the treatment efficacy in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Statistically significant differences between survivors vs. nonsurvivors were found in the parameter “Dose of norepinephrine in the first 24 hours”, 0.211 (0.022   1.104) vs. 0.333 (0.039   2.333), p < 0.001, OR (95 % IS) 2.009 (1.362; 2.965), p < 0.001

Conclusions: We found that a dose of norepinephrine affects the outcome of human septic shock. Patients who had bacteremia were more likely to have older age (mean [SD] age, 54.0 [12.6] vs 42.3 [16.9] years, p 0.004), diabetes mellitus (40 % vs 16 %, p 0.04), chill (100 % vs 61 %, p 0.01), higher body temperature (mean [SD] temperature, 101.3 [33.6] vs 100.0 [34.0] F, p 0.04), BUN/Cr ratio [>=] 16 (67 % vs 41 %, p 0.07) and CRP [>=] 20 mg/L (92 % vs 61 %, p 0.05). Lethal outcome was associated with mechanical ventilation (n = 65, 100 %, OR = 4.105, P = 0.05), multi drug resistant strain (n = 64, 98,5 %, OR = 1.182, P = 0.013), elderly (n = 36, 90 %, OR = 1.662, P = 0.016), resistance to cefalosporins (n = 57, 86.4 %, OR = 2.367, P = 0.04), and alcohol abuse (n = 9, 81.8 %, OR = 3.926, P = 0.05). After controlling for age, gender, urbanization level, socioeconomic status, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, malignancies, liver cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation, smoking, obesity, peripheral artery disease and Charlson Comorbidity Index score, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.65 (95 % confidence interval, 1.49¡X1.82) in patients with congestive heart failure. This study is being conducted through the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking in the EU and is a joint collaboration between Medimmune and the academic partners within the Combatting Bacterial Resistance in Europe – Molecules against Gram Negative Infections (COMBACTE MAGNET), which is a consortium of experts in the field of antibiotic resistant bacteria and ventilator associated pneumonia. Results: According to LPTEG indicators patients with massive postpartum bleeding had abnormality in all parts of hemostatic system: platelet aggregation   Intensity of contact coagulation(ICC) was reduced by 45.64 %, the coagulation   Intensity of coagulation drive(ICD) was less than normal at 59.32 %, clot maximum density (MA) was reduced by 88.15 % and fibrinolytic activity   Index of retraction and clot lysis(IRCL) was 86,16 % above the norm. Total, per patient, per hospitalization days (HD), per patient under mechanical ventilation (pts V) and per ventilation days (VD) Using linear correlation method, we looked for linear slope, correlation coefficient (r), and coefficient of determination (r2), and by linear regression method using ANOVA test we looked for p value, according VAP and FFP transfusion. About one third of all bleeding trauma patients present with a coagulopathy as a result of physiologic derangements such as acidosis, hypothermia, or haemodilution related to fluid administration.(1) In 2011, Morriston Hospital introduced a Massive Haemorrhage Protocol (MHP) in the Emergency Department (ED). Pv aCO2/Ca vO2 ratios were significantly lower in patients surviving the ICU and until day 28 of follow up; this relationship was observed both at time 0 (0.21,IQR 0.17 vs. 0.27, IQR 0.22, p =0.042) and at time 3 (0.19, IQR 0.1 vs. 0.24,IQR 0.07, p =0.047) for ICU mortality, and (0.27, IQR 0.19 vs. 0.18,IQR 0.12, p =0.013) and (0.27, IQR 0.08 vs. 0.19, IQR 0.10,p = 0.011) for 28 day survival. Introductions: The present study was designed to compare the impact of resuscitation with either 0.9 % sodium chloride (0.9 % NaCl) or a balanced hydroxyethylstarch (HES) solution (6 % HES 130/0.4, Volulyte®, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) on the conjunctival microcirculation in a sheep model of haemorrhagic shock. The question rises if differences between patients with any stage of AKI and patients with RRT requiring AKIN stage III can be identified looking at the “classical parameters” (serum creatinine (SCr), urea, potassium, bicarbonate, pH, cumulative fluid balance), plasma Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin (pNGAL) and urinary output (UO) at the time of first rise in SCr (first AKI). Results: Of the 139 patients evaluated for inclusion, 13 patients were excluded because of a history of chronic kidney disease, 5 patients were excluded because no creatinine at CRRT initiation was available, and 5 patients were excluded because an admission creatinine below 50 μmol/L. In the 116 included patients, 28 day mortality was 37 (32 %). PAMPS cause either direct damage or trigger an immune response in the host to fight infection leading to the production of high levels of cytokines and the release of DAMPS into the bloodstream, which can trigger a maladaptive systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that can contribute to organ injury. Also in the first day, in the seventh day and in the 14.day after admission to the intensive care, the APACHE II score, SOFA score, RIFLE score, biochemical parameters (albumin, prealbumin, urea, creatinin, cholesterol, HCO3  level), triceps thickness and waist circumference measurement were all recorded. Along with the improvement of general condition, appearance or improvement of the deglutition reflex, the oral nutrition with semi solid preparations recommenced in 5 children (22.5 %) from the first day of tracheostomy application, in 7 cs the nutrition recommenced on 3 5 day together with partial parenteral nutrition until the full resumption of oral nutrition. Results: Based on the results presented, the VMN delivered the highest emitted dose (70.49 ± 1.86 %, distal at 5 LPM), (67.84 ± 0.98 %, distal at 11 LPM) and (101.03 ± 5.45 %, proximal at 5 LPM), (107.40 ± 5.51 %, proximal at 11 LPM) at both attachment setups and supplemental gas flow rates compared with the JN (48.43 ± 6.92 %, distal at 5 LPM) & (47.94 ± 3.48 %, distal at 11 LPM) and (56.86 ± 1.12 %, proximal at 5 LPM), (53.48 ± 5.22 %, proximal at 11 LPM). After 30 minutes of CPAP, we noticed in group A patients an improvement of 52 % in pO2/FiO2 ratio, an increase of 0,02 points in pH value, a reduction of 10 % in pCO2, a lactate cleareance of 28 %, in group B an improvement of 120 % in pO2/FiO2 ratio, an increase of 0,13 points in pH value, a reduction of 20%in pCO2, a lactate cleareance of 35 %. Introduction: ICU patients require multiple monitoring inputs to optimize care & are subjected to many discomfort causing interventions.. Direct measurement of respiratory effort in non intubated patients is difficult, so clinicians rely on secondary indicators of respiratory sufficiency, such as pulse oximetry & capnography (EtCO2), which have significant limitations.

Introduction: Opioid use decreases respiratory drive and can cause opioid induced respiratory depression (OIRD), which is challenging to recognize in non intubated patients from respiratory rate (RR) alone. Introduction: Constipation in critically ill patients is a common problem and has been associated with a number of significant complications including prolonged mechanical ventilation, increased length of stay, compromise of intenstinal protective barrier and difficulty establishing enteral feeding [1]. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) through invasive arterial pressure monitoring, and rSO2 were measured at every 3 minutes during the cardiopulmonary resuscitation of OHCA patients, and the relationships between absolute values in the measurements were compared using the two types of coefficient of correlation, within and between patients in order to perform the statistical analysis considering repeated measurement taken from a single patient. To do this, we applied the general linear mixed model, a form of cluster analysis [2], to the data to create three algorithms: Algorithm 1 clustered patients on minute by minute physiological data, Algorithm 2 used the same data with six outlying patients removed, and Algorithm 3 used hour by hour data, with the same six outlying patients removed as in Algorithm 2. Worse outcomes were significantly more frequent in patients who were transfused in adjusted models (mortality RR: 2.25 [95%CI 1.41 to 3.59]; neurological complications RR: 3.45 [1.43 to 8.32]; trauma complications RR: 1.64 [1.29 to 2.07]; ICU LOS geometrical ratio: 1.99 [1.45 to 2.73]; hospital LOS geometrical mean ratio: 2.38 [1.51 to 3.75]). Results

Using data from 7132 consecutive ED patients (median age 62 years, 53.3 % male), the risk for 30 day mortality showed a stepwise increase from low (0.64 % [95 % CI 0.37 0.92]) in patients with a ProADM value of <0.75 nmol/L, to intermediate (4.38 % [95 % CI 3.58 5.18]) with a ProADM value >0.75 nmol/L and <1.5 nmol/L, to high (15.5 % [95 % CI 13.5 17.5]) with a ProADM value of >1.5 nmol/L (ANOVA, p < 0.0001).

A 21 year old male with a history of depression was admitted to our hospital emergency department two hours after the voluntary ingestion of a non quantified amount of barium chloride, which the patient had procured and purchased online as a means for a suicide attempt. Introduction

The aim of our observation retrospective study was to test the hypothesis that a correlation exists between percentages of ventilated patients developed VAP (% VP) and the use of main sedative and neuromuscular blockage agents indexes in our both medical and surgical ICU served in community hospital. Further work would be required to more accurately characterise risk factors, but validation of similar risk factors could facilitate prospective bed booking in a dedicated post anaesthetic care unit, with those patients who have risk factors for prolonged LOS instead being admitted directly to the general ICU post operatively. Introduction: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of pre defined clinical and biochemical criteria in predicting deterioration following hospital admission via the Emergency Department (ED), and to evaluate their utility as triggers for involvement of the iMobile Critical Care Outreach service within the hospital. Data collected: Demographics, reason for admission, emergency admissions, readmissions, co morbidities, source of admission (internal pediatric, internal surgical, other in city hospital, remote peripheral hospital), season of admission (spring, summer, autumn, winter), time of admission (in or out of hours), length of stay (LOS) and the outcome. Baseline HRV was significantly higher in survivors; ASDNN [31.5(IQR24) vs 12(IQR9),p = 0.002],rMSDD [25(IQR19) vs 11.5(IQR10), p = 0.012], pNN50% [6(IQR9.5) vs 0.75(IQR2.5),p = 0.002], meanNN[732.5(IQR291) vs 570(IQR87),p = 0.006], mean VLF [12.1(IQR11.8) vs 5.3(IQR4), p = 0.002], meanLF [8.5(IQR10.2) vs 3.4(IQR4.6), p = 0.009], meanHF [7.5(IQR6) vs 3.3(IQR3.9), p = 0.005]. At logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and gender, the only factor associated with mortality at ICU discharge was SAPS II score (OR 0.9, 95%CI 0.8 1, p = 0.046), while length of stay (LOS), type of palliative treatment received prior to ICU admission, metastatic spread, neutropenia, smoking and diabetic status and highest recorded lactate in the 24 hours prior to ICU admission seemed to not be associated with ICU outcome. In 2013, the hospital set up a multi disciplinary 24/7 enhanced critical care outreach service to support patients, relatives and staff providing: Rapid response & stabilisation; critical care follow up; outreach education; and delivering virtual critical care beds when critical care flows exceed capacity. Group 6 vignettes were randomly presented in two versions: 6.1 consisted in a “multiple choice” vignette in which the respondent was presented with the decision to admit an archetypical case for ICU admission or an elective surgery patient; 6.2 consisted in a “status quo” vignette, in which the last ICU bed was already reserved for an elective surgery patient and the respondent was presented with two simultaneous ICU requests for archetypical cases for ICU admission. Poor Prognosis was defined as patients with at least one of the following referral criteria:Hypoxic Ischaemic EncephalopathySevere Head Injury with poor neurological prognosisExtensive Intracerebral/Subarachnoid HaemorrhageLow presenting Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of less than 6

A multi disciplinary team, consisting of intensivists, neurosurgeons, medical social workers,nurses and palliative care medicine physicians formed the core team to lead this project in NICU. These patients, when compared to ICUnoPAL, were older (65 vs 54 years, p < 0.05), with more severe disease, as measured by MPMII0 score (0,40 vs 0,26, p < 0.05), less likely to be admitted to the ICU (49% vs 64%, p < 0.05) and had higher adjusted hospital mortality (83% vs 37%; OR [95%CI]: 7,2 [4,6 11,4]). Results: 240 patients were admitted in ICU for a 3 month period of which 42 patients died in ICU (17.5%) 2 patients died in the ward following withdrawal of care.29(65.9%) of whom had died followed withdrawal or withholding of care.11(18% of the dead)had spontaneous cardiac arrest or `Brain Dead.all patients who had limitation of patients."	0
2295	"The novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 has rapidly spread across the globe and is poised to cause millions of deaths worldwide. There are currently no proven pharmaceutical treatments, and vaccines are likely over a year away. At present, non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the only effective option to reduce transmission of the virus, but it is not clear how to deploy these potentially expensive and disruptive measures. Modeling can be used to understand the potential effectiveness of NPIs for both suppression and mitigation efforts. Methods and Findings: We developed Corvid, an adaptation of the agent based influenza model called FluTE to SARS CoV 2 transmission. To demonstrate features of the model relevant for studying the effects of NPIs, we simulated transmission of SARS CoV 2 in a synthetic population representing a metropolitan area in the United States. Transmission in the model occurs in several settings, including at home, at work, and in schools. We simulated several combinations of NPIs that targeted transmission in these settings, such as school closures and work from home policies. We also simulated three strategies for testing and isolating symptomatic cases. For our demonstration parameters, we show that testing followed by home isolation of ascertained cases reduced transmission by a modest amount. We also show how further reductions may follow by isolating cases in safe facilities away from susceptible family members or by quarantining all family members to prevent transmission from likely infections that have yet to manifest. Conclusions: Models that explicitly include settings where individuals interact such as the home, work, and school are useful for studying the effectiveness of NPIs, as these are more dependent on community structure than pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccination. Corvid can be used to help evaluate complex combinations of interventions, although there is no substitute for real world observations. Our results on NPI effectiveness summarize the behavior of the model for an assumed set of parameters for demonstration purposes. Model results can be sensitive to the assumptions made about disease transmission and the natural history of the disease, both of which are not yet sufficiently characterized for SARS CoV 2 for quantitative modeling. Models of SARS CoV 2 transmission will need to be updated as the pathogen becomes better understood.

is the (which was not peer reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10. 1101 We simulated the workplace based policies of liberal leave and work from home policies. For ""liberal leave"", people who normally go to work have an increased chance of staying home when feeling ill, beyond the normal tendency to stay home when ill. For ""work from home"", a fraction of the employed population stays home instead of going to work. Both of these interventions can increase the amount of transmission that occurs within a family if other members of the family are at home during the day, and among people who live near their homes, but it prevents workplace transmission and the movement of the pathogen between home and work communities. In our examples, we set compliance for these policies at 50%, so that 50% of workers who would not have stayed home because of illness would stay home one day after symptom onset and 50% of all workers opt to work from home. When these policies are implemented on day 30 of the epidemic, the epidemic peak was reduced and delayed, and the final attack rate was reduced. This can be seen in the blue curves in the top panels of Figure 1 , which show the simulated number of new symptomatic cases each day and the cumulative percentage of the population that became symptomatic. Enacting these policies later in the epidemic, on day 90, reduced the final attack rate but did not delay the peak, as seen in the bottom panels of Figure 1. As expected, the workplace policies greatly reduced the number of infections occurring in workplaces and slightly increased the number occurring in the home. Figure 2 shows the number of infections that take place in the model in the home, at school, in workplaces, and outside these settings for the scenarios described above.
We simulated adding school closures to these workplace policies. When schools close in the model, transmission stops occurring in schools but children have slightly more potentially infectious contacts in their communities. Preschool playgroups are not subject to school closures but transmission that occurs in them are counted towards ""schools"" in the model, so there will be some apparent school based transmission after school closures. Adding school closures reduced the final attack rates even further (red curves in Figure 1 ). We also ran simulations in which schools re opened while workplace based NPIs were left in place. We observed the epidemic rebound after schools re opened because we did not simulate scenarios that resulted in elimination (Figure 3 ).
Adding shelter in place reduced transmission even further. We modeled shelter in place by reducing everyone's community contacts (contacts outside of home, work, and schools) by 30%.

Much larger studies would be necessary to show important differences in mortality.
Despite the similar age range, packed cell volume, and admission parasite counts in the moderate and severe malaria groups, both drugs produced more rapid parasite clearance in the former than in the latter. This finding suggests either reduced splenic clearance function or a larger biomass of sequestered parasites in severe malaria.10 Absorption and disposition indices of chloroquine are similar in uncomplicated and severe disease,1,8 and pharmacokinetic factors would not therefore explain the difference. How parasitised erythrocytes (largely ring forms) are removed from the circulation after drug treatment is not fully understood, but this mechanism may be distinct from the ability of an antimalarial drug to inhibit and kill the mature parasites sequestered in the microcirculation of vital organs.1o
In 1989, when this study was done, chloroquine was a highly effective treatment for falciparum malaria in The Gambia. However, resistance has developed rapidly. By 1990, parasite clearance measures were longer, and Rl and R2 resistance was seen in half the patients admitted to the same study sites (unpublished). High grade resistance will soon preclude the use of chloroquine in severe malaria. Other treatments are needed urgently. The artemesinin compounds are promising. However, there is no evidence yet that they can save more lives than quinine (or chloroquine) given in appropriate doses. This issue will only be resolved satisfactorily by a large comparative study with mortality as the endpoint.

2300	Peptide inhibitors against the SARS CoV 2 coronavirus, currently causing a worldwide pandemic, are designed and simulated. The inhibitors are mostly formed by two sequential selfsupporting α helices (bundle) extracted from the protease domain (PD) of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which bind to the SARS CoV 2 receptor binding domains. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the α helical peptides maintain their secondary structure and provide a highly specific and stable binding (blocking) to SARS CoV 2. To provide a multivalent binding to the SARS CoV 2 receptors, many such peptides could be attached to the surfaces of nanoparticle carriers. The proposed peptide inhibitors could provide simple and efficient therapeutics against the COVID 19 disease.	1

We conducted a retrospective study included all 168 confirmed cases of Covidconfirmed by real time RT PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data.
Results: Of 168 patients, 160 have been discharged, 6 have died and 2 remain hospitalized. The median age was 51.0 years and 51.8% were females. 129 (76.8%) patients were imported cases, and 118 (70.2%), 51 (30.4%) and 52 (31%) of patients lived in Wuhan or traveled to Wuhan, had contact with Covid 19 patients, or had contact with Wuhan residents, respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (65.5%), dry cough (48.8%) and expectoration (32.1%). On admission, ground glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (60.2%).

2303	"Organization announced it as a pandemic. 2 Questions continue to be asked about how well the health care systems around the world are equipped to cope. From an individual and community perspective, what are our health expectations in a pandemic?
At times like these, people seek information through all possible channels, from their neighbours, family members and friends, to the media, the Internet, health care professionals and government organizations. This thirst for information is to address their knowledge gaps, inform their understanding of current events and future developments, and, importantly, help determine how vulnerable they are to contracting COVID 19 and what actions need to be taken for prevention and treatment. We expect accurate, timely and reliable information provided in a way that can be quickly accessed and easily understood. In this digital age, information has become a commodity that we expect to have ready access to, and receive much more frequently than in the past, via reputable news media and their online and social networking sites. We expect to receive accurate and reliable information from national and international organizations we trust, and, in turn, we expect that these organizations have received accurate and trustworthy data to report. We certainly expect the truth, but understand that up todate information may not always be possible, considering the time lag in data collection and data reporting, and the variable resources available globally to collate data. Lack of information, misinformation and inaccurate information can lead to hysteria and fuel behavioural outcomes such as panic buying. 3 A well informed public is critical at a time when the community is impacted by a viral outbreak.
We expect to be informed about prevention, and what we can do as individuals to help slow down the spread of the virus and subsequent infection within our communities. This goes beyond simply being told to practise good hygiene people need to know exactly what good hygiene entails. For example, we know we must wash our hands, but do we know when, how frequently, with what and for how long? If we are expecting to educate people, then the information must be understandable and actionable. If 20 seconds of hand washing with soap is part of practising good hygiene, 4 then this is the information that should be effectively communicated. Better still, it should be linked with an easily remembered action, such as singing a song that lasts 20 seconds. 4 People also need to know how effective preventative measures are. An understanding of the rationale for behaviour and its associated benefits and impact is more likely to motivate people to adopt the behaviour.
When faced with the unknown and unprecedented, fear and concern would be expected within the community. We expect to know what happens to a person who becomes infected with COVID 19. Clear and consistent information about the impact of an infection in otherwise healthy individuals, as well as in children, the elderly and those with underlying health problems is vital when people are facing a pandemic. With nearly 180 000 people (as of 17 March 2020) infected globally, 5 there should be enough data to accurately provide information about symptoms, severity and duration of the infection; as well as full recovery and mortality rates; characteristics of those recovering and those who have succumbed to the virus; cause(s) of death; and potential for reinfection.
Systems at a local, national and international level must work together to combat such novel threats and support the health and wellbeing of populations worldwide. We look to our governments to have COVID 19 action plans that would protect us from a pandemic. And undoubtedly, we want well resourced health care systems that enable timely and appropriate health care delivery, capable of effectively treating us should we end up in the infectious diseases ward of a hospital. We expect our health care workers to be supported and looked after so that they remain healthy to look after those infected. In short, we expect and hope to be filled with a sense of security when we are on the brink of a pandemic. This sense of security can come from knowledge that we are receiving timely, accurate and reliable information from trustworthy sources that are 'louder' than those sources providing biased, inaccurate and incorrect information.
Our efforts to overcome the COVID 19 outbreak have included research in identifying and better understanding the virus, developing a vaccine and identifying drug targets. It has also led to the development of professional guidelines, public health information and initiatives. Promisingly, we have seen governments and health care

Effector CD8   T cell derived interleukin 10 enhances acute liver immunopathology
Highlights Effector CD8   T cells produce IL 10 upon hepatocellular antigen encounter.
IL 10 enhances IL 2 responsiveness.
IL 10 inhibits antigen induced effector CD8   T cell apoptosis.
CD8   T cell derived IL 10 supports liver immunopathology.
Interleukin 10 is mostly regarded as an immunosuppressive cytokine. We show here that HBV specific CD8   T cells produce IL 10 upon antigen recognition and that this cytokine enhances CD8   T cell survival. As such, IL 10 paradoxically promotes rather than suppresses liver disease.
Background & Aims: Besides secreting pro inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and effector molecules, effector CD8   T cells that arise upon acute infection with certain viruses have been shown to produce the regulatory cytokine interleukin (IL) 10 and, therefore, contain immunopathology. Whether the same occurs during acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and role that IL 10 might play in liver disease is currently unknown.
Methods: Mouse models of acute HBV pathogenesis, as well as chimpanzees and patients acutely infected with HBV, were used to analyse the role of CD8   T cell derived IL 10 in liver immunopathology.
Results: Mouse HBV specific effector CD8   T cells produce significant amounts of IL 10 upon in vivo antigen encounter. This is corroborated by longitudinal data in a chimpanzee acutely infected with HBV, where serum IL 10 was readily detectable and correlated with intrahepatic CD8   T cell infiltration and liver disease severity. Unexpectedly, mouse and human CD8   T cellderived IL 10 was found to act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to enhance IL 2 responsiveness, thus preventing antigen induced HBV specific effector CD8   T cell apoptosis. Accordingly, the use of mouse models of HBV pathogenesis revealed that the IL 10 produced by effector CD8   T cells promoted their own intrahepatic survival and, thus supported, rather than suppressed liver immunopathology.
Conclusion: Effector CD8   T cell derived IL 10 enhances acute liver immunopathology. Altogether, these results extend our understanding of the cell and tissue specific role that IL 10 exerts in immune regulation.
Lay summary: Interleukin 10 is mostly regarded as an immunosuppressive cytokine. We show here that HBV specific CD8   T cells produce IL 10 upon antigen recognition and that this cytokine enhances CD8   T cell survival. As such, IL 10 paradoxically promotes rather than suppresses liver disease. Ó"	0
2305	"The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of COVID 19 with early renal injury, and to explore the value of multi index combined detection in diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID 19.
The study was an observational, descriptive study.
This study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China.
Participants
patients diagnosed with COVID 
The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID 19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), α 1 microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID 19 with early renal injury.
While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID 19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID 19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury.

2306	Since December 2019, the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 has spread very rapidly in China and worldwide. In this article, we report on a 75 year old man infected with 2019 novel coronavirus who has end stage kidney disease (ESKD). COVID 19 patients with ESKD need isolation dialysis, but most of them cannot be handled in time due to limited continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) machines. CRRT provided benefits for this patient by removing potentially damaging toxins and stabilizing his metabolic and hemodynamic status. With tests. Greater efforts are needed to decrease the mortality of COVID 19 infected ESKD patients.	1
2307	"already caused more than 100,000 deaths worldwide. It is characterized by distinct patterns of disease progression implying a diverse host immune response. However, the immunological features and molecular mechanisms involved in Covid 19 severity remain so far poorly known.
We performed an integrated immune analysis that included in depth phenotypical profiling of immune cells, whole blood transcriptomic and cytokine quantification on a cohort of fifty Covid19 patients with a spectrum of disease severity. All patient were tested 8 to 12 days following first symptoms and in absence of anti inflammatory therapy.
Results: A unique phenotype in severe and critically ill patients was identified. It consists in a profoundly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response characterized by a low interferon production and activity, with consequent downregulation of interferonstimulated genes. This was associated with a persistent blood virus load and an exacerbated inflammatory response that was partially driven by the transcriptional factor NFκB. It was also characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α and interleukin (IL) 6 production and signaling as well as increased innate immune chemokines.
We propose that type I IFN deficiency in the blood is a hallmark of severe Covid 19 and could identify and define a high risk population. Our study provides a rationale for testing IFN administration combined with adapted antiinflammatory therapy targeting IL 6 or TNF α in most severe patients. These data also raise concern for utilization of drugs that interfere with the IFN pathway."	0

2310	The world is currently witnessing dangerous shifts in the epidemic of emerging SARS CoV 2, the causative agent of (COVID 19) coronavirus. The infection, and death numbers reported by World Health Organization (WHO) about this epidemic forecasts an increasing threats to the lives of people and the economics of countries. The greatest challenge that most governments are currently suffering from is the lack of a precise mechanism to detect unknown infected cases and predict the infection risk of COVID 19 virus. In response to mitigate this challenge, this study proposes a novel innovative approach for mitigating big challenges of (COVID 19) coronavirus propagation and contagion. This study propose a blockchain based framework which investigate the possibility of utilizing peer to peer, time stamping, and decentralized storage advantages of blockchain to build a new system for verifying and detecting the unknown infected cases of COVID 19 virus. Moreover, the proposed framework will enable the citizens to predict the infection risk of COVID 19 virus within conglomerates of people or within public places through a novel design of P2P Mobile Application. The proposed approach is forecasted to produce an effective system able to support governments, health authorities, and citizens to take critical decision regarding the infection detection, infection prediction, and infection avoidance. The framework is currently being developed and implemented as a new system consists of four components, Infection Verifier Subsystem, Blockchain platform, P2P Mobile Application, and Mass Surveillance System. This four components work together for detecting the unknown infected cases and predicting and estimating the infection Risk of Corona Virus .	0

Clinical data, including demographic characteristic, presentation, underlying illness, exposure history, laboratory examination, radiology and prognosis were enrolled and analyzed by SPSS 19.0 software. Results There were 197 adult discharged patients with COVID 19 in this study.
Statistical analysis indicated that the average age was 55.94 years, and female patients were 99(50.3%).Those patients mainly resided in urban with exposure history in 2 weeks, while 7 medical staffs were infected. Fever (77.6%%), cough (43.6%) and weakness (14.7%) were the common symptoms. Leukocytes were mainly normal or decreased in 185 patients (92.9%), both lymphocytes and eosinophils were below normal range, the ratios were 56.9% and 50.3%, respectively. On the contrary, lactate dehydrogenases raised in 65 patients. C reactive protein (72.4%) elevated in the most of patients. The sensitivity of RT PCR was 63.5%. Chest CT indicated that bilateral patchy shadows (69.0%) were the most common imaging manifestations.169(85.8%) patients recovered and transferred to a designated hospital for observation, and the others (14.2%) turned worst and died of acute respiratory failure. Conclusion COVID 19 infection with highly contagious have become a life threaten public healthy problem, the sensitivity of RT PCR was limited.

2314	The rapid global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 has strained existing healthcare and testing resources, making the identification and prioritization of individuals most at risk a critical challenge. A recent study of patients in China discovered an association between ABO blood type and SARS CoV 2 infection status by comparing COVID 19 patients with the general population. Whether blood type is associated with increased COVID 19 morbidity or mortality remains unknown. We used observational healthcare data on 1559 individuals tested for SARS CoV 2 (682 COV ) with known blood type in the New York Presbyterian (NYP) hospital system to assess the association between ABO Rh blood type and SARS CoV 2 infection status, intubation, and death. We found a higher proportion of blood group A and a lower proportion of blood group O among COV  patients compared to COV , though in both cases the result is significant only in Rh positive blood types. We show that the effect of blood type is not explained by risk factors we considered (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight status, and chronic cardiovascular and lung disorders).

2315	"In this work we present an analysis of the two major strategies currently implemented around the world in the fight against COVID 19: Social distancing & shelter in place measures to protect the susceptible, and testing & contact tracing to identify, isolate and treat the infected. The majority of countries have principally relied on the former; we consider the examples of Italy, Canada and the United States. By fitting a disease transmission model to daily case report data, we infer that in each of the three countries, the current level of national shutdown is equivalent to about half the population being under quarantine. We demonstrate that in the absence of other measures, scaling back social distancing in such a way as to prevent a second wave will take prohibitively long. In contrast, South Korea, a country that has managed to control and suppress its outbreak principally through mass testing and contact tracing, and has only instated a partial shutdown. For all four countries, we estimate the level of testing which would be required to allow a complete exit from shutdown and a full lifting of social distancing measures, without a resurgence of COVID 19. We find that a ""brute force"" approach of untargeted universal testing requires an average testing rate of once every 36 to 48 hours for every individual, depending on the country. If testing is combined with contact tracing, and/or if tests are able to identify latent infection, then an average rate of once every 4 to 5 days is sufficient."	0

2317	Patients with acute olfactory disorders typically present to the otolaryngologist with both acute hyposmia and less often with anosmia. With the onset of COVID 19 we have noticed an increase in the number of patients who have presented with new onset of complete smell loss to the senior author's practice in Tehran, Iran. This anosmia and the frequency with which patients present is highly unusual. Coronaviruses have been known to cause common cold symptoms. COVID 19 infections have been described as causing more severe respiratory infections and the symptoms reported by authors from Wuhan, China have not specifically included anosmia. We describe patients who have presented during a two week period of the COVID 19 pandemic with complete loss of sense of smell. Most had either no symptoms or mild respiratory symptoms. Many had a normal otolaryngologic exam. A relationship between COVID 19 and anosmia should be considered during the pandemic. We hypothesize that the mechanism of injury is similar to deficits.	0

The contribution of cell mediated immunity to protective immunity against virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection conferred by primary porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) or TGEV exposure was assessed in pigs that were challenged with TGEV 24 days after a primary oronasal inoculation with PRCV or TGEV when 11 days old. PRCV exposure induced partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases (42% vs. 90% in age matched control pigs), limited virus shedding in feces, and increases in virusneutralizing serum antibody titers; in contrast, all 11 day old pigs inoculated with TGEV were completely protected after challenge. Weaned pigs were also studied to eliminate any possibility that lactogenic immunity from contact PRCV exposed sows kontributed to protection against TGEV. Once weaned, none of the PRCV exposed or age matched control pigs had diarrhea after TGEV challenge; moreover, both groups exhibited less recta1 virus shedding than suckling pigs. Vigorous lymphocyte proliferative responses ( > 96 000 counts per minute (cpm) ) were detected in mononuclear cells prepared from mesenteric (MLN) and bronchial (BLN) lymph nodes of TGEV primed pigs. Analyses of these responses indicate that virus specific cell mediated immune responses correlated with protection against rectal and nasal virus shedding after TGEV challenge.

2321	"Introduction: COVID 19 Ag Respi Strip, an immunochromatographic (ICT) assay for the rapid detection of SARS CoV 2 antigen on nasopharyngeal specimen, has been developed to identify positive COVID 19 patients allowing prompt clinical and quarantine decisions. In this Original Research article, we describe the conception, the analytical and clinical performances as well as the risk management of implementing the COVID 19 Ag Respi Strip in a diagnostic decision algorithm. Materials and Methods: Development of the COVID 19 Ag Respi Strip resulted in a readyto use ICT assay based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticles using monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2 highly conserved nucleoprotein antigen. Four hundred observations were recorded for the analytical performance study and thirty tests were analysed for the cross reactivity study. The clinical performance study was performed in a retrospective multi centric evaluation on aliquots of 328 nasopharyngeal samples. COVID 19 Ag Respi Strip results were compared with qRT PCR as golden standard for COVID 19 diagnostics.
Results: In the analytical performance study, the reproducibility showed a between observer disagreement of 1.7%, a robustness of 98%, an overall satisfying user friendliness and no crossreactivity with other virus infected nasopharyngeal samples. In the clinical performance study performed in three different clinical laboratories we found an overall sensitivity and specificity of 57.6% and 99.5% respectively with an accuracy of 82.6%. The cut off of the assay was found at Ct<22. User friendliness analysis and risk management assessment through Ishikawa diagram demonstrate that COVID 19 Ag Respi Strip may be implemented in clinical laboratories according to biosafety recommendations.
The COVID 19 Ag Respi Strip represents a promising rapid SARS CoV 2 antigen assay for the first line diagnosis of COVID 19 in 15 minutes. Its role in the proposed diagnostic algorithm is complementary to the currently used molecular techniques."	0
2322	The goal of this paper is to showcase that the COVID 19 disease pattern is evolving and to study the relationship between mandatory BCG policy and caseload/million or death/per million. We analyze seven recent publications on the impact of BCG vaccinations on the development of COVID19 illness and extend presented findings using the latest data from April 10, 2020. We analyze data from 98 countries and we extend existing models by adding the dimension of COVID 19 related testing conducted by the analyzed countries. Similarly to prior studies, we find that COVID 19 attributable case and death incidences across countries share a relationship with a country's BCG vaccination inclusion in the national immunization program when testing is not taken into consideration. However, this relationship vanishes when we add the dimension of testing. We observe that case and death incidences conditional on testing do not get affected by the countries' BCG vaccination inclusion in the national immunization program. Therefore, we show that there is no statistical evidence to support the assertion that inclusion of BCG vaccination in national immunization program (NIP) has any impact of COVID 19 infections (cases) or mortality.	0
2323	"Background: A range of case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates for COVID 19 have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.
We used individual case data from mainland China and cases detected outside mainland China to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age and location based underascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual line list data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation.
We estimate the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 16.9 19.2 days) and from onset of symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1 24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67% (95% crI 3.56% 3.80%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38% (95% crI 1.23% 1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages. Our estimate of the CFR from international cases stratified by age (under 60 / 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from China. We obtain an overall IFR estimate for China of 0.66% (0.39% 1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age.
Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID 19 disease and demonstrate a strong age gradient in risk."	0
2324	The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid 2019) is a source of great concern in the Philippines. In this paper, we described the epidemiological characteristics of the laboratory confirmed patients with Covid 2019 in the Philippines as of April 3, 2020 and provided recommendations on how to limit the spread of the disease. Data from the DOH NCOV tracker and University of the Philippines' Covid 2019 tracker were extracted, from its initiation (January 30, 2020) until the most recent situation report (April 3, 2020). The total number of cases and deaths were stratified by sex, age, and region of the Philippines. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the demographic profile of the confirmed cases. Case fatality rate, in percent, was calculated by dividing the total number of deaths to the total number of confirmed cases. Results revealed that a total of 3,018 cases of Covid 2019 spread were confirmed across 17 regions in the Philippines. These cases occurred over the course of 73 days through person to person transmission, highlighting an extremely high infectivity rate. The 144 deaths accounted for, equate to 4.51 case fatality rate, seemingly lower compared to its predecessors, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but higher compared to that of United States of America, Germany, mainland China, and neighboring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Thailand. Of the 3,018 confirmed cases, majority were male, elderly, and diagnosed in Metro Manila region. Case fatality rates were higher in male and highest among elderly and Filipinos in the Ilocos region. With the surge on the number of cases, precautionary measures should remain a responsibility, and protocols for prevention need to be set. Adherence to infection control guidelines such as but not limited to frequently handwashing for at least 20 seconds, observing coughing etiquette, wearing of masks, and social distancing should be maintained in order to contain the disease.	0

2326	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) has been pandemic in the world.1–4 It has now affected more than 560,000 Americans.3,5 Several attempts were successfully made to model COVID 19 daily incidence in China.1,6 However, the trends of daily incidence and deaths of COVID 19 in the USA are still poorly understood. Second, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended a priority based testing strategy and allowed for not testing some subjects considered low priority when the COVID 19 tests are short in supply.15 The criteria for testing COVID 19 in the USA, therefore, were different from those in China and Europe, where the WHO criteria were adopted.16–18 Thus, the patients, who met the WHO criteria, may not be tested and subsequently not included in the daily incidence.	0

2330	Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID 19 suspected cases plays a crucial role in timely quarantine and medical treatment. Developing a deep learning based model for automatic COVID 19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS CoV 2. A weakly supervised deep learning based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID 19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID 19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID positive and COVID negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weaklysupervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID 19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily trained and highperformance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID 19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS CoV detection.	0

2342	We propose a highly schematic economic model in which, in some cases, wage inequalities lead to higher overall social welfare. This is due to the fact that high earners can consume low productivity, non essential products, which allows everybody to remain employed even when the productivity of essential goods is high and producing them does not require everybody to work. We derive a relation between heterogeneities in technologies and the minimum Gini coefficient required to maximize global welfare. Stronger inequalities appear to be economically unjustified. Our model may shed light on the role of non essential goods in the economy, a topical issue when thinking about the post Covid	1
2343	medRxiv preprint Predictions on the time evolution of the number of severe and critical cases of COVID 19 patients in Guadeloupe are presented. A stochastic model is purposely developed to explicitly account for the entire population ( 400000 inhabitants) of Guadeloupe. The available data for Guadeloupe are analysed and combined with general characteristics of the COVID 19 to constrain the parameters of the model. The time evolution of the number of cases follows the well known exponential like model observed at the very beginning of a pandemic outbreak. The exponential growth of the number of infected individuals is controlled by the so called basic reproductive number, R 0 , defined as the likely number of additional cases generated by a single infectious case during its infectious period T I . Because of the rather long duration of infectious period ( 14 days) a high rate of contamination is sustained during several weeks after the beginning of the containment period. This may constitute a source of discouragement for people restrained to respect strict containment rules. It is then unlikely that, during the containment period, R 0 falls to zero. Fortunately, our models shows that the containment effects are not much sensitive to the exact value of R 0 provided we have R 0 < 0.6. For such conditions, we show that the number of severe and critical cases is highly tempered about 4 to 6 weeks after the beginning of the containment. Also, the maximum number of critical cases (i.e. the cases that may exceed the hospital's intensive care capacity) remains near 30 when R 0 < 0.6. For a larger R 0 = 0.8 a slower decrease of the number of critical cases occurs, leading to a larger number of deceased patients. This last example illustrates the great importance to maintain an as low as possible R 0 during and after the containment period. The rather long delay between the beginning of the containment and the appearance of the slowing down of the rate of contamination puts a particular strength on the communication and sanitary education of people. To be mostly efficient, this communication must be done by a locally recognised medical staff. We believe that this point is a crucial matter of success.

2346	"17 years after the SARS CoV epidemic, the world is facing the COVID 19 pandemic.
COVID 19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS CoV 2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called  1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS CoV revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of  1 PRF, that it also harbors a  1 PRF attenuation element. Altering  1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2 frameshift signals. Structural analyses reveal that the core  1 PRF signal, composed of the U UUA AAC slippery site Functional assays revealed that both elements promote similar rates of  1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery site strongly ablate  1 PRF activity. We suggest that molecules that were previously identified as inhibiting SARS CoV mediated  1 PRF may serve as lead compounds to counter the current pandemic."	1
2347	"Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus has continuous outbreaks around the world. Lung is the main organ that be involved. There is a lack of clinical data on the respiratory sounds of COVID 19 infected pneumonia, which includes invaluable information concerning physiology and pathology. The medical resources are insufficient, which are now mainly supplied for the severe patients. The development of a convenient and effective screening method for mild or asymptomatic suspicious patients is highly demanded. Methods: This is a retrospective case series study. 10 patients with positive results of nucleic acid were enrolled in this study. Lung auscultation was performed by the same physician on admission using a hand held portable electronic stethoscope delivered in real time via Bluetooth. The recorded audio was exported, and was analyzed by six physicians. Each physician individually described the abnormal breathing sounds that he heard. The results were analyzed in combination with clinical data. Signal analysis was used to quantitatively describe the most common abnormal respiratory sounds. Results: All patients were found abnormal breath sounds at least by 3 physicians, and one patient by all physicians. Cackles, asymmetrical vocal resonance and indistinguishable murmurs are the most common abnormal breath sounds. One asymptomatic patient was found vocal resonance, and the result was correspondence with radiographic computed tomography. Signal analysis verified the credibility of the above abnormal breath sounds. Conclusions: This study describes respiratory sounds of patients with COVID 19, which fills up for the lack of clinical data and provides a simple screening method for suspected patients.

Introducción: Diversas evidencias sugieren que el SARS CoV 2 puede penetrar en el sistema nervioso central (SNC). Los autores revisan los datos de la literatura sobre los hallazgos de coronavirus en el SNC asociado a enfermedades neurológicas.
Desarrollo: En las distintas epidemias con SARS CoV y MERS CoV la presencia de cuadros neurológicos es baja, pero se describen cuadros aislados de pacientes. También existen casos asociados a OC43 CoV y 229E CoV. La existencia de lesiones neurológicas, especialmente desmielinizantes en el modelo MHV CoV pueden explicar mecanismos de penetración de los CoV en el SNC y especialmente aquellos relacionados con la respuesta inmune, que puede justificar la existencia de CoV en pacientes con esclerosis múltiple. Los autores revisan aspectos diferenciales de SARS CoV 2 y se plantean si debido al alto número de infectados, el virus puede afectar de forma mayor al SNC.
Conclusión: Aunque la presencia de síntomas neurológicos en las epidemias de CoV es baja, la mayor frecuencia de infectados por SARS CoV 2 podría justificar el paso del virus y la posibilidad de clínica neurológica precoz o tardía con mayor incidencia. El seguimiento de los pacientes de la epidemia debe atender con cuidado a la evaluación del SNC."	0

2351	Barley plays an important role in health and civilization of human migration from Africa to Asia, later to Eurasia. We demonstrated the systematic mechanism of functional ingredients in barley to combat chronic diseases, based on PubMed, CNKI, and ISI Web of Science databases from 2004 to 2020. Barley and its extracts are rich in 30 ingredients to combat more than 20 chronic diseases, which include the 14 similar and 9 different chronic diseases between grains and grass, due to the major molecular mechanism of six functional ingredients of barley grass (GABA, flavonoids, SOD, K Ca, vitamins, and tryptophan) and grains (β glucans, polyphenols, arabinoxylan, phytosterols, tocols, and resistant starch). The antioxidant activity of barley grass and grain has the same and different functional components. These results support findings that barley grain and its grass are the best functional food, promoting ancient Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations, and further show the depending functional ingredients for diet from Pliocene hominids in Africa and Neanderthals in Europe to modern humans in the world. This review paper not only reveals the formation and action mechanism of barley diet overcoming human chronic diseases, but also provides scientific basis for the development of health products and drugs for the prevention and treatment of human chronic diseases.	1

This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid 19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.2

2354	"The risk of complications and death from COVID 19 is markedly skewed toward older adults. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently wrote, ""Given their congregate nature and residents served (eg, older adults often with underlying chronic medical conditions), nursing home populations are at the highest risk of being affected by COVID 19. If infected with SARS CoV 2, the virus that causes COVID 19, residents are at increased risk of serious illness."" 1 However, in the United States and many other countries, nursing homes are not the only congregate setting that serves older adults with underlying chronic medical conditions. More so, they have been a shrinking component of the residential long term care system, with some of the largest growth having been in assisted living (AL). AL communities provide supportive care, at least 2 meals a day, and 24hour supervision to individuals who need daily supportive care, but not daily nursing care. 2, 3 Recent estimates are that there are 30,200 licensed AL communities across the United States, providing care to more than 835,000 residents 4 dwhich constitutes almost 40% of persons who receive residential long term care in this country. More than half of the AL residents are ""old old"" or ""oldest old"": 53% are aged 85 or older, compared with 42% in nursing homes and 47% receiving hospice. 4 More so, many have the chronic underlying conditions implicated in COVID 19: 34% have heart disease, 17% have diabetes, and 15% have lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and allied conditions), and more than a quarter have between 4 and 10 chronic health conditions. 5 Thus, the AL population is at high risk for being affected by COVID 19 and suffering serious outcomes.
Importantly, AL communities are not the same as nursing homes. In fact, there are several distinct components of AL that make this a unique setting and one not to be ignored in relation to planning and response. This editorial summarizes key differences and their related implications for care."	0

It requires that each tattoo carrying subject perform a systemic sarcoidosis check up as well as an ophthalmological investigation in search of possible uveitis. If confirmed, preventive and therapeutic measures will be carried out in emergencies to avoid blindness.

The 2019 novel coronavirus proteome was aligned to a curated Methods: database of viral immunogenic peptides. The immunogenicity of detected peptides and their binding potential to HLA alleles was predicted by immunogenicity predictive models and NetMHCpan 4.0.
We report identification of a comprehensive list of Results:
in silico immunogenic peptides that can be used as potential targets for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) vaccine development. First, we found 28 nCoV peptides identical to Severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARS CoV) that have previously been characterized immunogenic by T cell assays. Second, we identified 48 nCoV peptides having a high degree of similarity with immunogenic peptides deposited in The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Lastly, we conducted a de novo search of 2019 nCoV 9 mer peptides that i) bind to common HLA alleles in Chinese and European population and ii) have T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition potential by positional weight matrices and a recently developed immunogenicity algorithm, iPred, and identified in total 63 peptides with a high immunogenicity potential.

2357	"Organisation as a pandemic due to its worldwide spread. The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. Methods Using COVID 19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in cases, the magnitude of the epidemic peak, and the outbreak duration were obtained.
Findings The application of all four social distancing interventions: school closure, workplace non attendance, increased case isolation, and community contact reduction is highly effective in flattening the epidemic curve, reducing the maximum daily case numbers, and lengthening outbreak duration. These were also found to be effective even after 10 weeks delay from index case arrivals. The most effective single intervention was found to be increasing case isolation, to 100% of children and 90% of adults.
Interpretation As strong social distancing intervention strategies had the most effect in reducing the epidemic peak, this strategy may be considered when weaker strategies are first tried and found to be less effective. Questions arise as to the duration of strong social distancing measures, given they are highly disruptive to society. Tradeoffs may need to be made between the effectiveness of social distancing strategies and population willingness to adhere to them."	0
2358	We propose a Susceptible Infected (SI) epidemic spreading model including containment measures. In absence of containment measures the epidemics spreads exponentially fast for any value of the infectivity λ > 0. The containment measures are modeled by considering a time dependent modulation of the bare infectivity λ leading to an effective infectivity that decays in time for each infected individual, mimicking for instance the combined effect of asymptomatic onset of the disease, testing policies and quarantine. We consider a wide range of temporal kernels for the effective infectivity and we investigate the effect of the considered containment measures. We find that not all kernels are able to push the epidemic dynamics below the epidemic threshold, with some containment measures only able to reduce the rate of the exponential growth of new infected individuals. We also propose a model with pandemic caused by a growing number of new separated foci. This model provides a stylized mathematical framework that can shed light on the role of different containment measures in 19.	0

2360	We present a System Dynamics (SD) model of the Covid 19 pandemic spread in India. The detailed age structured compartment based model endogenously captures various disease transmission pathways, expanding significantly from the standard SEIR model. The model is customized for India by using the appropriate population pyramid, contact rate matrices, external arrivals (as per actual data), and a few other calibrated fractions based on the reported cases of Covid 19 in India. Also, we have explicitly modeled, using independent time variant levers, the effects of testing, contact tracing, isolating Covid positive patients, quarantining, use of mask/better hygiene practices, social distancing through contact rate reductions at distinct zones of home(H), work(W), school(S) and other(O) locations. Simulation results show that, even after an extended lock down, some non trivial number of infections (even asymptomatic) will be left and the pandemic will resurface. Only tools that work against the pandemic is high rate of testing of those who show Covid 19 like symptoms, isolating them if they are positive and contact tracing all contacts of positive patients and quarantining them, in combination with use of face masks and personal hygiene. A wide range of combination of effectiveness of contact tracing, isolation, quarantining and personal hygiene measures help minimize the pandemic impact and some imperfections in implementation of one measure can be compensated by better implementation of other measures.	0
2361	"We have recently identified three molecules (tilorone, quinacrine and pyronaridine tetraphosphate) which all demonstrated efficacy in the mouse model of infection with mouse adapted Ebola virus (EBOV) model of disease and had similar in vitro inhibition of an Ebola pseudovirus (VSV EBOV GP), suggesting they interfere with viral entry.
Using a machine learning model to predict lysosomotropism these compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit via a lysosomotropic mechanism in vitro. We now demonstrate in vitro that pyronaridine tetraphosphate is an inhibitor of Lysotracker accumulation in lysosomes (IC 50 = 0.56 μM). Further, we evaluated synergy between pyronaridine and artesunate (Pyramax®), which are used in combination to treat malaria. Artesunate was not found to have lysosomotropic activity in vitro and the combination effect on EBOV inhibition was shown to be additive. Pyramax® may represent a unique example of the repurposing of a combination product for another disease."	0

2364	Within the context that Greece promises a success story in the fight against the disease, this paper proposes a novel method to study the evolution of the Greek COVID 19 infection curve in relation to the anti COVID 19 policies applied to control the pandemic. Based on the ongoing spreading of COVID 19 and the insufficient data for applying classic time series approaches, the analysis builds on the visibility graph algorithm to study the Greek COVID 19 infection curve as a complex network. By using the modularity optimization algorithm, the generated visibility graph is divided into communities defining periods of different connectivity in the time series body. These periods reveal a sequence of different typologies in the evolution of the disease, starting with a power pattern, where a second order polynomial (U shaped) pattern intermediates, being followed by a couple of exponential patterns, and ending up with a current logarithmic pattern revealing that the evolution of the Greek COVID 19 infection curve tends into saturation. The network analysis also illustrates stability of hubs and instability of medium and low degree nodes, implying a low probability to meet maximum (infection) values at the future and high uncertainty in the variability of other values below the average. The overall approach contributes to the scientific research by proposing a novel method for the structural decomposition of a time series into periods, which allows removing from the series the disconnected past data facilitating better forecasting, and provides insights of good policy and decision making practices and management that may help other countries improve their performance in the war against COVID 19.	0
2365	The emergence of novel COVID 19 causing an overload in health system and high mortality rate. The key priority is to contain the epidemic and prevent the infection rate. In this context, many countries are now in some degree of lockdown to ensure extreme social distancing of entire population and hence slowing down the epidemic spread. Further, authorities use case quarantine strategy and manual second/third contact tracing to contain the COVID 19 disease. However, manual contact tracing is time consuming and labor intensive task which tremendously overload public health systems. In this paper, we developed a smartphone based approach to automatically and widely trace the contacts for confirmed COVID 19 cases. Particularly, contacttracing approach creates a list of individuals in the vicinity and notifying contacts or officials of confirmed COVID 19 cases. This approach is not only providing awareness to individuals they are in the proximity to the infected area, but also tracks the incidental contacts that the COVID 19 carrier might not recall. Thereafter, we developed a dashboard to provide a plan for government officials on how lockdown/mass quarantine can be safely lifted, and hence tackling the economic crisis. The dashboard used to predict the level of lockdown area based on collected positions and distance measurements of the registered users in the vicinity. The prediction model uses K means algorithm as an unsupervised machine learning technique for lockdown management.	0

2370	Soaring case fatality rates across European states, disparate public health and global health security response across borders, baseline health care infrastructure differences, and significant social, economic, and political influences on key decision making all exacerbate the challenges of this acute crisis. Beyond the integrated political crisis response mechanism as it is designed today, the EU, currently still including the United Kingdom, urgently requires a practical tool to analyze and fully apprehend the nexus between the different civilian and military (security and logistic) components of a crisis and disaster, as well as the determinant of the health/wealth concept that bound health systems to the political and economic dimensions of the EU.	1
2371	"We developed a SEIR epidemiological model in the form of a Master equation (Keeling & Rohani 2008; Gardiner 2009 ). The model is designed specifically to study small scale communities under a various degrees of intervention measures in the form of quarantined clusters of people, and where quarantined individuals leave the quarantine from time to time and enter public locations. Any individual upon confirmed infection are isolated, i.e., removed from the small scale community (i.e., moved to a hospital).
Let , , and Ω represent random variables corresponding to , , and , where [ , , , Ω] can respectively take any realized values [( = 0,1, … , ), ( = 0,1, … , ), ( = 0,1, … , ), ( = 0,1, … , )], with the restriction that       = ; that is, the sum of individuals in different compartments cannot exceed the household group size . The household group size should be perceived as an average group size. However, the model does not explicitly consider the distribution of group sizes, and therefore also not the variation around this mean. The results will be most valid for household size distributions with smaller variances. Let 9:;< denote the probability of finding the system in state = ( , , , (9AB,:CB)"	0
2372	The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic radically impacts our lives, while the transmission/infection and recovery dynamics of COVID 19 remain obscure. A time dependent Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series of COVID 19 evolution observed in the last three months (till 3/22/2020) in various provinces and metropolises in China. The model results revealed the space dependent transmission/infection rate and the significant spatiotemporal variation in the recovery rate, likely due to the continuous improvement of screening techniques and public hospital systems, as well as full city lockdowns in China. The validated SEIR model was then applied to predict COVID 19 evolution in United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea which have responded differently to monitoring and mitigating COVID 19 so far, although these predictions contain high uncertainty due to the intrinsic change of the maximum infected population and the infection/recovery rates within the different countries. In addition, a stochastic model based on the random walk particle tracking scheme, analogous to a mixing limited bimolecular reaction model, was developed to evaluate non pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate COVID 19 spread. Preliminary tests using the stochastic model showed that self quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing COVID 19 spread, if quarantined.	0

Here, we characterized SARS CoV 2 specific CD4   and CD8   T cells in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The spike protein (S) proved a potent T cell antigen and specific T cells predominantly produced Th1 cytokines. These novel data are important in vaccine design and will facilitate evaluation of vaccine candidate immunogenicity.

2374	"The total number of COVID 19 infections is critical information for decision makers when assessing the progress of the pandemic, its implications, and policy options. Despite efforts to carefully monitor the COVID 19 pandemic, the reported number of confirmed cases is likely to underestimate the actual number of infections. We aim to estimate the total number of COVID 19 infections in a straightforward manner using a demographic scaling approach based on life tables.
We use data on total number of COVID 19 attributable deaths, population counts, and life tables as well as information on infection fatality rates as reported in Verity et al. (2020) for Hubei, China. We develop a scaling approach based on life tables and remaining life expectancy to map infection fatality rates between two countries to account for differences in their age structure, health status, and the health care system. The scaled infection fatality rates can be used in combination with COVID 19 attributable deaths to calculate estimates of the total number of infected. We also introduce easy to apply formulas to quantify the bias that would be required in death counts and infection fatality rates in order to reproduce a certain estimate of infections.
Findings: Across the 10 countries with most COVID 19 deaths as of April 17, 2020, our estimates suggest that the total number of infected is approximately 4 times the number of confirmed cases. The uncertainty, however, is high, as the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval suggests on average twice as many infections than confirmed cases, and the upper bound 10 times as many. Country specific variation is high. For Italy, our estimates suggest that the total number of infected is approximately 1 million, or almost 6 times the number of confirmed cases. For the U.S., our estimate of 1.4 million is close to being twice as large as the number of confirmed cases, and the upper bound of 3 million is more than 4 times the number of confirmed cases. For Germany, where testing has been comparatively extensive, we estimate that the total number of infected is only 1.2 times (upper bound: 3 times) than the number of confirmed cases. Comparing our results with findings from local seroprevalence studies and applying our bias formulas shows that some of their infection estimates would only be possible if just a small fraction of COVID 19 related deaths were recorded, indicating that these seroprevalence estimates might not be representative for the total population.
Interpretation: As many countries lack population based seroprevalence studies, straightforward demographic adjustment can be used to deliver useful estimates of the total number of infected cases. Our results imply that the total number COVID 19 cases may be approximately 4 times (95%: 2 to 10 times) that of the confirmed cases. Although these estimates are uncertain and vary across countries, they indicate that the COVID 19 pandemic is much more broadly spread than what confirmed cases would suggest, and the number of asymptomatic cases or cases with mild symptoms may be high. In cases in which estimates from local seroprevalence studies or from simulation models exist, our approach can provide a simple benchmark to assess the quality of those estimates."	0
2375	Understanding the temporal dynamics of COVID 19 patient phenotypes is necessary to derive finegrained resolution of pathophysiology. Here we use state of the art deep neural networks over an institution wide machine intelligence platform for the augmented curation of 15.8 million clinical notes from 30,494 patients subjected to COVID 19 PCR diagnostic testing. By contrasting the Electronic Health Record (EHR) derived clinical phenotypes of COVID 19 positive (COVIDpos, n=635) versus COVID 19 negative (COVIDneg, n=29,859) patients over each day of the week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify anosmia/dysgeusia (37.4 fold), myalgia/arthralgia (2.6 fold), diarrhea (2.2 fold), fever/chills (2.1 fold), respiratory difficulty (1.9 fold), and cough (1.8 fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The specific combination of cough and diarrhea has a 3.2 fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR derived signature of COVID 19 (4 7 days prior to typical PCR testing date). This study introduces an Augmented Intelligence platform for the realtime synthesis of institutional knowledge captured in EHRs. The platform holds tremendous potential for scaling up curation throughput, with minimal need for retraining underlying neural networks, thus promising EHR powered early diagnosis for a broad spectrum of diseases.	0
2376	"This initial outbreak
is in most cases mitigated with a time delay by effective containment strategies and
policies that reduce transmission and effective reproduction of the virus, commonly yielding
a saturation in the cumulative case count and an exponential decay in the number of new
infections (12). Three
questions immediately arise, (i) what may be the reason for this functional dependency, (ii)
are provinces other than Hubei mostly driven by export cases from Hubei and therefore follow
a similar functional form in case counts as suggested by preliminary studies discussing the
influence of human travel (14–16), or, alternatively, (iii) is the scaling law a consequence of
endogenous and basic epidemiological processes, caused by a balance between transmission
events and containment efforts. For instance, many
people wore face masks in public spaces and followed stricter hygiene procedures concerning
hand washing, universities remained closed, many businesses closed down, and people were
asked to remain in their homes for as much time as possible, in several places enforced by
mandatory curfews. While the explicit shape of the growth curves discussed here
can be influenced by factors such as seasonal effects, systematic delay in reporting, or
heterogeneities in demographic structure and population mixing, the fact that total case
numbers eventually reached a stable value suggests that containment strategies that shielded
the susceptible population from the transmission process were rather
effective—compared to potential case numbers of an unmitigated outbreak, only a small
fraction of the Chinese population that was at risk has been infected up to date (Mar.

2381	"Objective: Awareness and attentiveness have implications for the acceptance and adoption of disease prevention and control measures. Social media posts provide a record of the public's attention to an outbreak. To measure the attention of Chinese netizens to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19), a pre established nationally representative cohort of Weibo users was searched for COVID 19 related key words in their posts. Methods: COVID 19 related posts (N = 1101) were retrieved from a longitudinal cohort of 52 268 randomly sampled Weibo accounts (December 31, 2019 February 12, 2020)
. Results: Attention to COVID 19 was limited prior to China openly acknowledging human to human transmission on January 20. Following this date, attention quickly increased and has remained high over time.
Particularly high levels of social media traffic appeared around when Wuhan was first placed in quarantine (January 23 24, 8 9% of the overall posts), when a scandal associated with the Red Cross Society of China occurred (February 1, 8%) , and, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang (February 6 7, 11%), one of the whistleblowers who was reprimanded by the Chinese police in early January for discussing this outbreak online. Conclusion: Limited early warnings represent missed opportunities to engage citizens earlier in the outbreak. Governments should more proactively communicate early warnings to the public in a transparent manner."	0

The 26 2020 annual meeting of the European Association of 27 Urology due to be held in July has been postponed. The 28 annual meeting of the American Urological Association has 29 also been cancelled and will be replaced by a virtual 30 education symposium. Similarly, many other events at 31 national and regional levels have been cancelled. Such 32 drastic decisions were mandatory considering that the peak 33 of the COVID 19 spread has not yet been reached, and that 34 differences in epidemic curves among countries make 35 global organization difficult. Urologists worldwide are also 36 being asked to reorganize their clinical activity to support 37 internists and anesthesiologists [1 3]. Moreover, giving the 38 high virulence of COVID 19, gathering thousands of 39 attendees in a single venue would be inappropriate [4,5]. 40 Despite the inevitability of these decisions, they have 41 significant consequences: (1) continuing medical education 42 has been disrupted; and (2) the economic damage to 43 scientific societies and industry partners appears to be 44 huge. In trying to solve these issues and overcome the well 45 established format for traditional meeting, the possibility of 46 organizing a virtual congress using online technology seems 47 to be attractive and safe.

The most 58 modern tool for live distance learning is webinar technology 59 [7] (Fig. 1A).

2384	We perform a counterfactual time series analysis using two different Data Science methods applied to 2020 mortality data reported from towns in Italy, with data from the previous five years as control. We find an excess mortality that is correlated in time with the COVID 19 reported death rate time series. Our analysis shows good agreement with reported COVID 19 mortality for age<70 years, but an excess in total mortality increasing with age above 70 years, suggesting there is a large population of predominantly old people missing from the official fatality statistics. We estimate that the number of COVID 19 deaths in Italy is 52,000 ± 2000 as of April 18 2020, more than a factor of 2 higher than the official number. The Population Fatality Rate (PFR) has reached 0.22% in the most affected region of Lombardia and 0.57% in the most affected province of Bergamo, which constitutes a lower bound to the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR). We estimate PFR as a function of age, finding a steep age dependence: in Lombardia (Bergamo province) 0.6% (1.7%) of the total population in age group 70 79 died, 1.6% (4.6%) in age group 80 89, and 3.41% (10.2%) in the age group above 90. We combine this with the Test Positivity Rate to estimate the lower bound of 0.84% on the IFR for Lombardia. We observe IFR to trace the Yearly Mortality Rate (YMR) above 60 years, which can be used to estimate the IFR for other regions in the world. We predict an IFR lower bound of 0.5% for NYC and 26% of total COVID 19 mortality arising from the population below 65 years, in agreement with the existing data and several times higher than Lombardia. Combining PFR with the Princess Diamond cruise ship IFR for ages above 70 we estimate the infection rates (IR) of regions in Italy, which peak in Lombardia at 23% (12% 41%, 95% c.l.), and for provinces in Bergamo at 67% (33% 100%, 95% c.l.). This suggests that Bergamo may have reached herd immunity, and that the number of infected people greatly exceeds the number of positive tests, by a factor of 35 in Lombardia * .	0

RT qPCR testing of respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses in acute respiratory infection. RT qPCR in house protocols to detect the SARS CoV 2 have been described. Validations of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for COVID 19, especially if executed in a high throughput format. Here, we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two interim RT qPCR protocols for the qualitative detection of SARS CoV 2 executed in a fully automated platform. Under our conditions, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets. E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary confirmatory assay. Taken together, N1, RdRP (optimized) and E presented appropriated analytical sensibility and specificity in our automated RT qPCR workflow for COVID 19 virus, E being at least 4 fold less sensitive than the others. This study highlights the importance of local validation of in house assays before its availability to the population. The use of the synthetic RT qPCR target to investigate novel assays diagnostic parameters in automated workflows is a quick, simple effective way to be prepared for upcoming threats. The proposed assay detected the fisrt SARS CoV 2 infection in Brazilian Central West.

Based on the rapid increase in the rate of human infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the COVID 19 outbreak as a pandemic. Because no specific drugs or vaccines for COVID 19 are yet available, early diagnosis and management are crucial for containing biosensing device for detecting SARS CoV 2 in clinical samples. The sensor was produced by coating graphene sheets of the FET with a specific antibody against SARS CoV 2 spike protein.
The performance of the sensor was determined using antigen protein, cultured virus, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from COVID 19 patients. Our FET device could detect the SARS CoV 2 spike protein at concentrations of 1 fg/mL in phosphate buffered saline and 100 fg/mL clinical transport medium. In addition, the FET sensor successfully detected SARS CoV 2 in culture medium (limit of detection [LOD]: 1.6 × 10 1 pfu/mL) and clinical samples (LOD: 2.42 × 10 2 copies/mL). Thus, we have successfully fabricated a promising FET biosensor for SARS CoV 2; our device is a highly sensitive immunological diagnostic method for COVID 19 that requires no sample pretreatment or labeling."	1

Vaccina virus is the prototype of the poxvirus family (for review, see MossS). These are DNA viruses that replicate in the cell cytoplasm and have genomes between 150 and 300 kbp. The virions are large and complex, and in the case of VV, have dimensions of 250 x 350 nm and contain more than 100 proteins. 6 The study of VV binding and entry has been complicated by the fact that there are two morphologically distinct infectious virions, termed intracellular mature virus (IMV) and extracellular enveloped virus (EEV). 7'8 Structurally, IMV consists of a core surrounded by one membrane, 9'1° whereas EEV consists of an IMV with an additional outer membrane containing proteins, which is absent from IMV (Fig. 1) . IMV remains within the cytoplasm until cell lysis and represents the majority of infectious progeny; for instance, with the Western Reserve (WR) strain of virus, IMV represents 99% of infectivity. In contrast, EEV is released actively from infected cells before cell lysis and is the form of the virus that is important for virus dissemination in vitro and in Extracellular enveloped virus is formed by the wrapping of IMV with 5"	0

2400	In this paper are presented mathematical predictions on the evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy of the COVID 19 pandemic based on official data and on the use of a function of the type of a Gauss error function, with four parameters, as a cumulative distribution function. We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy. The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID 19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the error function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, that is, to the change in sign of its second derivative (i.e., the change from acceleration to deceleration), as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have also analyzed the predictions of the cumulative number of fatalities in both China and Italy, obtaining consistent results. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease in the number of daily positive cases and fatalities. Although official data have been used, those predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach since they are based on a statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as number of daily nasopharyngeal diffusion.	0

2404	The fact of inter urban competition and urban entrepreneurialism has opened up the urban space of the advanced capitalist countries to all kinds of new patterns of development, even when the net effect has been the serial reproduction of science parks, gentrification, world trading centers, cultural and entertainment centers, large scale interior shopping malls with postmodern accouterments, and the like. The neo liberal national policies that stimulated urban renewal through the deregulation of urban planning, building standards, and the housing market (e.g., the Urban Renaissance Special Measure Law of 2002) strongly supported the re growth of central Tokyo from the beginning of the twenty first century onward. To overcome the problems in cities related to rapid urbanization in major metropolitan areas, many city governments developed their own urban zoning plans, delineating their urban areas into two categories: (1) urbanization promotion areas that stimulated urban and economic development with strict zoning plans; and (2) urbanization control zones that strictly controlled urban development to maintain a pleasant rural and agricultural environment (the classification was  based on The City Planning Act of 1968). Moreover, many local landowners continued to protest against nearby airport related development, and the national and municipal governments introduced special measure laws and organized official meetings between airport representatives and area residents to discuss the allocation of public funds to the improvement of urban infrastructure, the residential environment, and public and cultural facilities.	0

2406	"Background. Reporting of daily hospital COVID 19 deaths in the UK are promoted by the government and scientific advisers alike as a key metric for assessing the progress in the control of the epidemic. These data, however, have certain limitations, among which one of the most significant concerns the fact that the daily totals span deaths that have occurred between 1 and 10 days or more in the past.
Data and methods. We obtained daily data published published by NHS England up to and including April 25 in the form of Excel spreadsheets in which deaths counts are presented by date of death according to age and region. Simple descriptive analyses were conducted and presented in graphical and tabular form which were aimed at illustrating the biases inherent in focussing on daily counts regardless of when the deaths occurred. We then looked at how a less biased picture could be obtained by looking at trends in death counts stratifying by individual period of delay in days between occurrence of death and when the death was included in the daily announcement."	0
2407	Objective: Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID 19) outbreak as pandemic, there are reports on the increased prevalence of physical symptoms observed in the general population. We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Methods: Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID 19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS 21) and the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Results: Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54 5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36 3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27 7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12 4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical	0
2408	"The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) has infected thousands of people with a large number of deaths across 26 countries. The sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing therapies for SARS CoV 2. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. This study took immune informatics approaches to identify B and T cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS CoV 2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class I and nine MHC class II binding T cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B and T cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development. : bioRxiv preprint
Methods
Primary sequence of SARS CoV 2 protein was retrieved from NCBI database using accession number MN908947.3 [3]. Experimentally known 3D structure of SARS CoV 2 S protein was retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6VSB)[1]. Protein sequence was analyzed for its chemicals and physical properties including GRAVY (Grand average of hydropathicity), half life, molecular weight, stability index and amino acid atomic composition via an online tool Protparam [13]. TMHMM v2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) was applied to examine the transmembrane topology of S protein. Secondary structure of SARS CoV 2 protein was analyzed by PSIPRED [14]. Existence of disulphide bonds were examined through an online tool DIANNA v1.1 which uses trained neural system to make predictions [15]. Antigenicity of full length S protein was evaluated by vaxijen v2.0 [16]. B cell epitope prediction IEDB (Immune Epitope Database And Analysis Resource) [17] with default parameter settings were used to predict B cell epitopes. Epitopes predicted by linear epitope prediction of Bepipred and Bepipred2.0, Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity, Parker hydrophilicity, Chou and Fasman beta turn,
and Karplus and Schulz flexibility. BcePred [18] was also used to predict B cell epitopes using accessibility, antigenic propensity, exposed surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity and turns.
Predicted B cell epitopes by IEDB and BcePred were combined to the B cell epitope candidate list. Based on transmembrane topology of S protein predicted by TMHMM v2.0, only epitopes on the outer surface were remained, and other intracellular epitopes were eliminated. VaxiJen 2.0 [16] was applied to evaluate the antigenicity of the remained epitopes. A stringent criteria was used to have antigenicity score of 0.9 and 14 residue length epitopes viewed adequate to start a defensive immune reaction. A B cell discontinuous epitope forms the antigen binding interface through fragments scattered along the protein sequence. DiscoTope2.0[19] with discotope score threshold of  3.7 was used to predict discontinuous epitopes. Pymol was used to examine the positions of selected linear and discontinuous epitopes on the 3D structure of SARS CoV 2 protein."	0
2409	"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID 19 pandemic, alternative methods of care are needed to reduce the relative risk of transmission in departments. Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments. We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in person treatment coverage practice.
METHODS: All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions. The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage. Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the RO's shared screen. Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment.
RESULTS: Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment. Average times of pre treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively. The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO's shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s. The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in person RO coverage comfort levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures. This may help to reduce transmission of COVID 19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs support."	0

2412	"Objectives: United States government scientists estimate that COVID 19 may kill tens of thousands of Americans. Many of the pre existing conditions that increase the risk of death in those with COVID 19 are the same diseases that are affected by long term exposure to air pollution. We investigated whether long term average exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with an increased risk of COVID 19 death in the United States.
Design: A nationwide, cross sectional study using county level data.
Data sources: COVID 19 death counts were collected for more than 3,000 counties in the United States (representing 98% of the population) up to April 22, 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center.
We fit negative binomial mixed models using county level COVID 19 deaths as the outcome and county level long term average of PM2.5 as the exposure. In the main analysis, we adjusted by 20 potential confounding factors including population size, age distribution, population density, time since the beginning of the outbreak, time since state's issuance of stay at home order, hospital beds, number of individuals tested, weather, and socioeconomic and behavioral variables such as obesity and smoking. We included a random intercept by state to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state. We conducted more than 68 additional sensitivity analyses.
We found that an increase of only 1 g/m3 in PM2.5 is associated with an 8% increase in the COVID 19 death rate (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2%, 15%). The results were statistically significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions: A small increase in long term exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in the COVID 19 death rate. Despite the inherent limitations of the ecological study design, our results All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

A clear evidence based guide to aid the design of serological studies is critical to policy makers and public health officials both for estimation of seroprevalence and for forward looking modeling efforts, particularly if serological positivity reflects immune protection. To address this need, we developed a framework that can be used to design and interpret serological studies, with applicability to SARS CoV 2. Starting with results from a serological survey of a given size and age stratification, the framework incorporates the test's sensitivity and specificity and enables estimates of population seroprevalence that include uncertainty. These estimates can then be used in models of disease spread to calculate the effective reproductive number R eff , the transmission potential of SARS CoV 2 under partial immunity, to forecast disease dynamics, and to assess the impact of candidate public health and clinical interventions. Similarly, starting with a pre specified tolerance for uncertainty in seroprevalence estimates, the framework can be used to define the sample size needed. This framework can be used in conjunction with any model, including ODE models (3, 4), agent based simulations (5), or network simulations (6), and can be used to estimate R eff or to simulate transmission dynamics."	0

2415	Diarrhea is one of the most common causes of antimicrobial use and mortality in young calves. To reduce antimicrobial use and resistance on dairy farms, research on alternative therapies for calf diarrhea is necessary. Our laboratory previously conducted a randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of lactoferrin, an iron binding protein found in colostrum, as a treatment for calf diarrhea. The trial showed significantly reduced calf mortality in diarrheic calves that were administered lactoferrin. Thus, the objective of this study was to corroborate the results of our prior clinical trial across multiple farms and to investigate the effect of lactoferrin on the morbidity and mortality of preweaned calves with naturally occurring cases of diarrhea. This randomized field trial was conducted on 5 commercial dairy farms in Ohio. In total, 485 calves (≤21 d of age) were enrolled at first diarrhea diagnosis (fecal score ≥2 defined as loose to watery) and randomly assigned to receive an oral dose of lactoferrin (3 g of lactoferrin powder dissolved in 30 mL of water) or 30 mL of water (control) once daily for 3 consecutive days. Health assessments were conducted on the day of diarrhea diagnosis (d 0) and 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d following diagnosis. Producer records of disease treatment and mortality were collected 120 d following diagnosis. A Poisson regression model was used to test differences between treatments in disease frequency through 35 d post diarrhea diagnosis and the incidence risk of treatment and mortality risk 120 d post diarrhea diagnosis; the model controlled for calf age at enrollment, farm, and treatment. Median calf age at enrollment was 11 d and ranged from 1 to 26 d of age. At study enrollment, 51.3% (123/240) and 52.2% (128/245) of calves in the control and lactoferrin treatment groups, respectively, were diagnosed with severe diarrhea (fecal score = 3). The frequency of disease (diarrhea, dehydration, depression, signs of respiratory disease) through 35 d following diarrhea diagnosis was not significantly different for calves in the lactoferrin and control groups. Overall mortality risk for enrolled calves was 9.9%, and 10.7% (22/243) and 9.1% (26/242) of calves in the lactoferrin and control groups, respectively, died or were culled in the 120 d following diarrhea diagnosis. The relative risk of death or culling did not differ between treatment groups, however. Therefore, as performed in this study, lactoferrin as a treatment for calf diarrhea was not beneficial.	0

We perform a massive analysis on as an exogenous shock similar to a natural disaster. We identify two ways through which mobility restrictions affect Italian citizens. First, we find that the impact of lockdown is stronger in municipalities with higher fiscal capacity. Second, we find a segregation effect, since mobility restrictions are stronger in municipalities for which inequality is higher and where individuals have lower income per capita.	1
2419	The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus infection that were confirmed outside China provide an opportunity to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in mainland China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic potential of COVID 19 in the early stage of the epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naïve population. We modeled epidemic growth either from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December 2019 (Scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January 2020. The cumulative incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%, 7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively.

2421	As SARS CoV 2 threatens to overwhelm health systems in Canada, it is imperative that provinces are able to plan and manage an effective and reduced risk response. For this response to be most effective, it must reflect an evidence based, pan Canadian response. We designed four different prototypical patients with a combination of common COVID 19 symptoms and opportunities for exposure who were made to self assess using the 10 provincial COVID 19 self assessment tools on 1 April. These tools were developed to allow individuals to self triage, allowing health systems direct capacity to testing and care. We assessed the consistency of the self assessment tools and of the guidance provided to the patients. While the tools generally screen in three areas, the scope of included COVID 19 associated symptoms as well as the opportunities for exposure, and therefore transmission, vary between provinces such that no two provinces screened in the same way. This was, in turn, reflected in the inconsistency in guidance found. A patient with cough who had travelled abroad or had close contact with a confirmed case within 14 days received the most consistent guidance, with remaining patients receiving guidance ranging from mandatory quarantine or self isolation to being told they did not have symptoms, guidance at odds with medical evidence. Thus, there is not a single, evidence based Canadian standard of care simply for self assessment. Without consistency in public health guidance, Canadians cannot appropriately self isolate to mitigate community transmission, nor can the necessary valid and reliable data be collected to inform critical epidemiological models that help guide pandemic response. If federal and provincial governments are unable to coordinate a response, Parliament must use its available jurisdiction to legislate a duty on both to follow national standards, so as to improve coordination on COVID 19 in coming months.	0

2423	The novel coronavirus, COVID 19, has sparked an outflow of scientific research seeking to understand the virus, its spread, and best practices in prevention and treatment. If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID 19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from practices reveals underlying weaknesses in the research community's reporting habits, but not necessarily their science.	1
2424	In the last decade, humanity has faced many different pandemics such as SARS, H1N1, and presently novel coronavirus . On one side, scientists are focusing on vaccinations, and on the other side, there is a need to propose models that can help us in understanding the spread of these pandemics as it can help governmental and other concerned agencies to be well prepared, especially from pandemics, which spreads faster like COVID 19. The main reason for some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different regions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographical area, often worldwide. In addition, the population distribution and social coherence in the different regions of the world is non uniform. Thus, once the epidemic enters a region, then the local population distribution plays an important role. Inspired by these ideas, we proposed a mobility based SIR model for epidemics, which especially takes into account pandemic situations. To the best of our knowledge, this model is first of its kind, which takes into account the population distribution and connectivity of different geographic locations across the globe. In addition to presenting the mathematical proof of our model, we have performed extensive simulations using synthetic data to demonstrate our model's generalizability. To demonstrate the wider scope of our model, Estonia.	0
2425	"The worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, the disease has spread worldwide. As it currently spreading in the United States, policy makers, public health officials and citizens are racing to understand the impact of this virus on the United States healthcare system. They fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm the healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, * Corresponding Author such as social distancing, to decrease the rate of newly infected people, i.e. flattening the curve.
In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of the number of people hospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory. Given that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the theory of infinite server queues with non stationary Poisson arrival rates. With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how flattening the curve impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time of the peak demand for the hospital resources. Finally, we present empirical evidence from China, South Korea, model."	0

2427	"The current COVID 19 pandemic is rapidly spreading around the world. The first doctor to report this new disease was an ophthalmologist: this exemplifies the role of ophthalmologists in an infectious disease pandemic. Here we review how SARS Cov2 affects the eye and discuss implications for ophthalmologists.
and will never be medically evaluated. (II) To date we have no data regarding how many patients with conjunctivitis (who did or didn't attended the eye emergency department) developed COVID 19 in the following days. (III) During the COVID 19 epidemic ophthalmologists may have to deal with patients affected by conjunctivitis of other nature and have no guidelines on how to make a differential diagnosis.
J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 3 Furthermore, recent studies suggest that the conjunctiva may represent a possible transmission route [5, 6] . The presence of the SARS CoV 2 in the conjunctival sac of affected patients is also reported by a nonpeer reviewed retrospective cohort study [7] . Anecdotal reports further suggested that when no eye protection was worn, the virus could also possibly be transmitted by aerosol contact with conjunctiva and cause infection II [7] . However, the possible transmission of SARS CoV 2 by conjunctiva is controversial.
Nevertheless, the WHO and the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) III recommend wearing eye protection (e.g., goggles or shield) when treating patients (potentially) infected with COVID 19 to prevent droplet transmission.
It can't be stated enough that, before the ophthalmological check, it is mandatory to know if the patient has COVID 19 symptoms and if the patient has recently been in contact with a confirmed COVID 19 case. A strategy to prevent transmission in ophthalmology outpatient clinics adopted in all public hospitals in Hong Kong during the COVID 19 outbreak should serve as templates for other ophthalmologic practices [8] .
Installation of protective shields on slit lamps were implemented and surgical masks were worn by both ophthalmologists and patients.
The adoption of strict hand hygiene and wearing goggles or face masks is highly recommended for every ophthalmologist. Because of the proximity to patients' nose and mouth and the potential exposure to tears, which might contain the virus, ophthalmologists are especially at risk to contracting the disease.
In 2006 during a major SARS outbreak in Hong Kong. Ophthalmic practices took similar preventive measures (frequent hand washing with the use of chlorhexidine alcoholic handrub; wearing surgical/N95 respirator masks, as well as gloves and water resistant gowns and visors) to prevent contracting or spreading the SARS infection [9] . Considering that these measures prevented staff and patients from being infected during the SARS epidemic, we recommend that these measures should be adopted in a notdeferrable ophthalmological examination also during this pandemic. In addition to that, the patient should wear mask and gloves during the examination."	0

Sub cluster C 1 includes BCoVs and BCoVs like from America and Asia. Sub cluster C 2 includes BCoVs from Europe. Sub cluster C 3 includes prototype, vaccine, or attenuated BCoV strains. The phylogenetic analyses revealed the monophyletic status of the BCoVs from France reported here for the first time. Moreover, BCoV exhibits a relative genetic stability when compared to HCoV OC43 we previously described from the same region. The numerous recombination detected between HCoV OC43 were much less frequent for BCoV. The analysis points thus to the influence of different evolutive constraints in these two close groups."	0

Purpose: Syndromic surveillance is aimed at early detection of disease outbreaks. An important data source for syndromic surveillance is free text chief complaints (CCs), which may be recorded in different languages. For automated syndromic surveillance, CCs must be classified into predefined syndromic categories to facilitate subsequent data aggregation and analysis. Despite the fact that syndromic surveillance is largely an international effort, existing CC classification systems do not provide adequate support for processing CCs recorded in non English languages. This paper reports a multilingual CC classification effort, focusing on CCs recorded in Chinese.
We propose a novel Chinese CC classification system leveraging a Chinese English translation module and an existing English CC classification approach. A set of 470 Chinese key phrases was extracted from about one million Chinese CC records using statistical methods. Based on the extracted key phrases, the system translates Chinese text into English and classifies the translated CCs to syndromic categories using an existing English CC classification system.
Results: Compared to alternative approaches using a bilingual dictionary and a generalpurpose machine translation system, our approach performs significantly better in terms of positive predictive value (PPV or precision), sensitivity (recall), specificity, and F measure (the harmonic mean of PPV and sensitivity), based on a computational experiment using real world CC records.
Our design provides satisfactory performance in classifying Chinese CCs into syndromic categories for public health surveillance. The overall design of our system also points out a potentially fruitful direction for multilingual CC systems that need to handle languages beyond English and Chinese."	0

2435	"Chest computed tomography (CT) is recognized as an important tool for COVID 19 severity assessment. As the number of affected patients increase rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor intensive task, and may lead to delayed treatment.
Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize automatic severity assessment (non severe or severe) of COVID 19 based on chest CT images, and to explore the severity related features from the resulting assessment model.
Chest CT images of 176 patients (age 45.3±16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID 19 are used, from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the whole lung and the volume of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions, are calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity (non severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of COVID 19, is calculated from the RF model.
Using three fold cross validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to the severity of COVID 19, and the quantitative features calculated from the right lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left lung.
The RF based model can achieve automatic severity assessment (non severe or severe) of COVID 19 infection, and the performance is promising. Several quantitative features, which have the potential to reflect the severity of COVID 19, were revealed."	0

The relationship between porcine circovirus 2 antigen score and antibody titre and histology of lymph nodes in 375 euthanased sick and healthy pigs from 113 British pig farms with and without postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome A B S T R A C T Data from a cross sectional study of 113 British pig herds carried out in 2004 were used to investigate the associations between postweaning multisystemic wasting (PMWS) in pigs and herds and porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) antigen score and antibody titre, and associated histological signs in lymph nodes. The sensitivity and specificity of published herd definitions for PMWS were tested on the study farms to consider the role of PCV2 in PMWS. Herds were defined as PMWS affected,  unaffected or  recovered based on current and past postweaning mortality (PWM), grower pigs with clinical signs of rapid wasting, hairiness and pallor and no other known cause of death on the farm. PCV2 antigen and antibody were not used in the definition of PMWS. In each PMWS affected herd, up to three sick pigs with the clinical signs above and one healthy pig of a similar age were taken for postmortem examination (PME). In all other herds at least one healthy pig was taken for PME. Lymph nodes were analysed for PCV2 antigen and histological changes, and serum samples were analysed for PCV2 antibody.
PCV2 antibody was present in all the herds sampled. There was a non linear association between PCV2 antigen and antibody. There was no association between the presence of high scores of PCV2 antigen in pigs and the presence of high PWM in herds. PCV2 antigen score was significantly higher in sick than healthy pigs within farms, and high PCV2 score was associated with giant cells, coalescence and absence of germinal centres in lymph nodes. These results did not vary by PMWS affected,  unaffected or  recovered farms. PCV2 antigen was present at high scores in approximately 10% of healthy pigs on all farms. All three herd definitions of PMWS were highly sensitive, defining PMWS affected herds as affected, but had a specificity ranging from 23% to 43%.
We conclude that the current diagnostic tests for PCV2 indicated higher scores of virus in sick pigs but were not useful to define pigs or herds with PMWS. The ubiquity of PCV2 and the lack of specificity of the PCV2 tests indicate that PCV2 may be a necessary but not sufficient cause of PMWS disease. Linking this with the knowledge that the herd breakdowns occurred in a space time epidemic indicates that another infectious co factor may be necessary for disease to occur. ß"	0
2439	"Isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAT), such as loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), are good alternatives to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based amplification assays, especially for point of care and low resource use, in part because they can be carried out with relatively simple instrumentation. However, iNATs can generate spurious amplicons, especially in the absence of target sequences, resulting in false positive results. This is especially true if signals are based on non sequence specific probes, such as intercalating dyes or pH changes. In addition, pathogens often prove to be moving, evolving targets, and can accumulate mutations that will lead to inefficient primer binding and thus false negative results. Internally redundant assays targeting different regions of the target sequence can help to reduce such false negatives. Here we describe rapid conversion of three previously described SARS CoV 2 LAMP assays that relied on non sequence specific readout into assays that can be visually read using sequencespecific fluorogenic oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes. We evaluate one pot operation of both individual and multiplex LAMP OSD assays and demonstrate detection of SARS CoV 2 virions in crude human saliva. : bioRxiv preprint
We have taken pains to make LAMP OSD robust for resource poor settings. Lyophilized master mixes are stable without cold chain for extended durations and can be operated simply upon rehydration and addition of crude sample. 18 The one pot operation, direct analysis of crude specimens, and easy yes/no visual readout make LAMP OSD ideal for field operation with minimal training and resources.

2444	"Background: Smartphones have become an indispensable part of the daily lives of adolescents in the 21st century, which is characterized by a highly digitized modern world. Besides their many advantages, smartphones might pave the way to compulsive usage and addictive experiences. To remedy this problem, this study proposes an authentic approach which integrates consumer behavior theories and techniques such as unhook and gamification. An education program has been designed based on these approaches to decrease the problematic smartphone use. Method: The participants of the education program consisted of 305 students (48.2% girls and 51.8% boys) with a mean age of 14.57 (SD = 0.74). The Demographic Form and Smartphone Addiction Scale for Adolescents (SASA) were conducted before the education program and three weeks after the education. Results: The results of the paired sample t test analysis before and after the education program revealed that the SASA total scores decreased significantly (p < 0.01). There are significant differences in terms of gender, mothers' education and class levels. Conclusion: This research emphasizes the role of an interdisciplinary approach to the addiction problem. The content used in the education program includes strategies that originally aimed at increasing consumption. The effectiveness of the program can be enhanced further in the future along with self regulatory additions.
literature are their negative effect in interpersonal relations, [12] , personal health [13] well being [14, 15] , including decreased academic performance and decreased physical activity [16] as well as depression symptoms [17] . Validating this phenomenon, American Psychiatric Association addressed this behavior in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM 5) by introducing the non substance addiction as a psychiatric diagnosis, although there are still controversies on the topic [18] .
Contemporary research on behavioral psychology points out that addictions arise out of problematic habit driven behavior, which is a natural outcome of ineffective self regulation and self control [19] . As such, this repetitive habitual behavior increases the risk of personal and social problems [20] . Frequent interruptions were found to result in loss of productivity [21] and higher tendency of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [22] . Even the mere existence of a smartphone on a table when studying was found to result in reduced cognitive capacity and up to a 10% decrease in IQ [23, 24] . Studies show that it takes 23 min on average for a fully concentrated individual to come back to the previous state after being interrupted with a notification message [25] . Worsening the case, the probability that the individual will self interrupt increases by 8%.
As devices are being carried around all the time, Oulasvirta et al.
[26] distinguish smartphone usage behavior as a series of 'short duration, isolated, reward based' (SIRB) sessions as opposed to other technological devices like tablets and laptops. In this sense, informational rewards reinforce the checking behavior ultimately, performing it out of habit. As smartphones give access to a broad variety of sources for seeking information, socializing and entertainment, the overall reward value of ""checking"" habits increases as well.
Until recent times, severe criticisms of technology platforms due to their addictive by design experiences have gone unnoticed. However, the last couple of years witness a change in this case. As a result of the increasing awareness of these addictive by design techniques and the lobbying activities, technology platforms have started to adopt a more responsible code of conduct. As an example, Instagram and some other social media platforms changed their infinite scroll feature so that the users can scroll back up to two days. Again, as of 2019, Instagram started to hide the number of 'likes' to a post to avoid a meaningless competition of having more likes.
Problematic smartphone use can be attributed to many factors. In the last decade, however, it is argued that digital platforms' architected, finely tuned experiences that are designed to be addictive to deliberately make consumers spend prolonged periods of time on screens result in more problematic smartphone use [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Therefore, as opposed to looking from a mere psychological perspective, the need to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to prevent problematic smartphone use is brought into consideration.
Looking from a marketing perspective, we propose that using the same techniques that increase consumption but in reverse manner can effectively work in preventing problematic smartphone use. In the remainder of the paper, the defining characteristics of the modern digital marketing environment are discussed first. Afterwards, the mechanics of deliberately designed habit forming experiences are explored. Finally, a consciousness based preventive educational program on adolescents is proposed. The results of the study conducted among 305 students in 14 schools located in Istanbul, Turkey are also analyzed and discussed.
Adolescents were chosen as the target group since their acquaintance with smartphones is relatively new as opposed to their older counterparts, which implies that their smartphone behavior is not ossified yet. A study conducted late in 2019 in Turkey revealed that the most problematic smartphone use is seen in young adolescents and this problematic behavior rate decreases as the age of the users increases [32] . Another study conducted in Turkey published that 90.7% of the youngest age group (16 24). Internet use is listed as the heaviest compared to all other age groups. This group partially includes adolescents (10 19 years) which implies that this age group is the most susceptible to problematic smartphone use [33] .

2453	"Purpose: To date, considerable knowledge gaps remain regarding the chest CT imaging features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 . We performed a systematic review and meta analysis of results from published studies to date to provide a summary of evidence on detection of COVID 19 by chest CT and the expected CT imaging manifestations.
Methods: Studies were identified by searching PubMed database for articles published between December 2019 and February 2020. Pooled CT positive rate of COVID 19 and pooled incidence of CT imaging findings were estimated using a random effect model.
A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled positive rate of the CT imaging was 89.76% and 90.35% when only including thin section chest CT. Typical CT signs were ground glass opacities (83.31%), ground glass opacities with mixed consolidation (58.42%), adjacent pleura thickening (52.46%), interlobular septal thickening (48.46%), and air bronchograms (46.46%). Other CT signs included crazy paving pattern (14.81%), pleural effusion (5.88%), bronchiectasis (5.42%), pericardial effusion (4.55%), and lymphadenopathy (3.38%). The most anatomic distributions were bilateral lung infection (78.2%) and peripheral distribution (76.95%). The incidences were highest in the right lower lobe (87.21%), left lower lobe (81.41%), and bilateral lower lobes (65.22%). The right upper lobe (65.22%), right middle lobe (54.95%), and left upper lobe (69.43%) were also commonly involved. The incidence of bilateral upper lobes was 60.87%. A considerable proportion of patients had three or more lobes involved (70.81%).
The detection of COVID 19 chest CT imaging is very high among symptomatic individuals at high risk, especially using thin section chest CT. The most common CT features in patients affected by COVID 19 included ground glass opacities and consolidation involving the bilateral lungs in a peripheral distribution."	0

2455	"Background Since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019, 68 imported cases and 175 locally acquired infections have been reported in Singapore. We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful.
We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human to human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS CoV 2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R 0 ] of 1•5, 2•0, or 2•5) and assuming 7·5% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R 0 value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines."	0

2460	"AIM: To summarise the features of chest computed tomography (CT) of a series of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCov) to speed up recognition and have a better understanding of COVID 19 disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical information and chest CT images of 93 patients infected with 2019 nCov from multiple centres were reviewed.
RESULTS: Of the 93 cases, abnormalities in 91 cases were located at the subpleural level, presenting with ground glass opacity (GGO; n¼69, 74.2%) and consolidation (n¼56, 60.2%) in multiple lobes. Other CT features included vascular dilatation (n¼83, 89.2%), interlobular septal thickening (n¼29, 31.2%), bronchodilatation (n¼44, 47.3%), the crazy paving sign (n¼34, 36.6%), the sieve hole sign (n¼12, 12.9%), pleural thickening (n¼21, 22.6%), and pleural effusion (n¼8, 8.6%). Multiple lobe involvement, including the presence of consolidation, the crazypaving sign, interlobular septal thickening, pleural thickening and pleural effusion, was more common in critical patients with heavy/critical infection (p<0.05), whereas the presence of GGO, involvement of one or two lobes, and the halo sign were more common in patients with mild/common type infections (p<0.05). Moreover, older age, higher body temperature, complaints of chest tightness and breathlessness, and lymphopenia was associated with heavy/critical infections.

2464	"Background: Information on kidney impairment in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is limited. This study aims to assess the prevalence and impact of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in hospitalized COVID 19 patients in Wuhan.
We conducted a consecutive cohort study of COVID 19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. Incidence rate for acute kidney injury (AKI) was examined during the study period. Association between kidney impairment and in hospital death was analyzed.
We included 710 consecutive COVID 19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51 71), including 374 men and 336 women. On admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Kaplan Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count.

2466	We present here several variants of a mathematical model to explore three main issues related to SARS CoV 2 spread in scenarios similar to those present in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. We explore the consequences for travel inside a given region, in this case Mexico, particularly focusing on airplane transportation but attempting to give a gross approximation to terrestrial movement since this is the main form of population movement across geographical areas in the country; then we proceed to study the effect of behavioral changes required to lower transmission by lowering the contact rate and infection probability and lastly, we explore the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to social isolation.These models are not suitable for predictive purposes although some rough predictions can be extracted from them. They are presented as a tool that can serve to explore plausible scenarios of spread and impact, effectiveness and consequences of contention and mitigation policies. Given the early stage at which the epidemic is at the date of writing in Mexico, we hope these ideas can be helpful for the understanding of population.	0

2473	"Novel SARS Cov 2 enters human cells via interaction between the surface spike (S) glycoprotein and the cellular membrane receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Using a combination of comparative structural analyses of the binding surface of the S protein to ACE2, docking experiments, and molecular dynamics simulations we computationally identified a minimal, stable fragment of ACE2. This fragment binds to the S protein, is soluble, and appears not to bind to the physiological ligand angiotensinII. These results suggest a possible use of the ACE2 fragment as a decoy that could interfere with viral binding by competition.

Results
Using the coordinates of the recently solved structure of the complex (pdb:6VW1), we determined the per residue interaction energies between the human ACE2 protein and the SARS Cov 2 S protein to ACE2 with RosettaDock (12, 13). The results are shown in Figure 1A and 1B, where we highlight the key residues involved in binding. Table 1 lists the interacting amino acids between the human receptor ACE2 and viral proteins from SARS Cov 2 and SARS Cov. In addition, we also report the interaction energy values between SARS Cov 2 and ACE2 computed with RosettaDock.
We also compared complexes of ACE2 bound to the C terminal RBD of viral S protein from SARS Cov 2 (pdb:6VW1) and SARS Cov (pdb:2AJF) using structural superposition, since these complexes are structurally very similar ( Figure  1C ). To rule out crystal packing artifacts, we also superimposed the cryo EM structure of the SARS Cov complex (pdb:6ACK) onto the crystal structures.

2474	Social distancing has been adopted as a non pharmaceutical intervention to prevent the COVID 19 pandemic from overwhelming the medical resources across the United States (US). The catastrophic socio economic impacts of this intervention could outweigh its benefits if the timing and duration of implementation are left uncontrolled and ill strategized. Here we investigate the dynamics of social distancing on age stratified US population and benchmark its effectiveness in reducing the burden on hospital and ICU beds. Our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social social distancing duration. We determine an optimal intermittent socialto no distancing ratio of 5:1 corresponding to ~80% reduction in healthcare demands  beyond this ratio, benefit of social distancing diminishes to a negligible level.	1

We compared the R0 estimated from five different methods and R0 from SB was further used in analysis. We modified standard SIR models to SIRD model to accommodate deaths using R0 with the Sequential Bayesian method (SBM) for simulation in SIRD models.
On an average, 2.8 individuals were infected by an index case. The mean serial interval was 3.9 days. The R0 estimated from different methods ranged from 1.43 to 1.85. The mean time to recovery was 14 ± 5.3 days. Daily epidemic growth rate of India was 0.16 [95%CI; 0.14, 0.17] with a doubling time of 4.30 days [95%CI; 3.96, 4.70]. From the SIRD model, it can be deduced that the peak of SARS CoV 2 in India will be around mid July to early August 2020 with around 12.5% of population likely to be infected at the peak time.

For each province, the cumulative number of reported infected cases is available each day. The data are analyzed through a Poisson generalized linear model with logarithmic link function and polynomial regression on time. Automatic model selection is performed to choose among a first , second , and third degree polynomial, based on the statistical significance of the corresponding estimated parameters. The model is used to produce up to today estimates of the growth rate of the infected subjects in each province. Results are plotted on a map of the country to allow for a visual assessment of the geographic distribution of the areas of differential trends in the number of cases. For each province, the most recent reported infection rate with respect to the resident population is also shown through the use of symbols having area proportional to such rates.	1

The abundant presence of ACE2 in the epithelia of the lung and intestine is widely acknowledged, and this ACE2 might be part of one route of COVID‐19 transmission."	1
2480	"Significance and Impact of the Study: The noncoding upstream and downstream flanks of coronavirus genomes allow for rapid classification of novel Betacoronavirus species and correct identification of genetic relationships. Although bats are the likely natural host of 2019_nCoV, the exact bat species that serves as the natural host of the virus remains as yet unknown. Chinese bat species with commercial value were identified as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Since their trading provides a potential risk for spreading zoonoses, a change in these practices is highly recommended.
The current outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome like coronavirus, 2019_nCoV (now named SARS CoV 2), illustrated difficulties in identifying a novel coronavirus and its natural host, as the coding sequences of various Betacoronavirus species can be highly diverse. By means of wholegenome sequence comparisons, we demonstrate that the noncoding flanks of the viral genome can be used to correctly separate the recognized four betacoronavirus subspecies. The conservation would be sufficient to define target sequences that could, in theory, classify novel virus species into their subspecies. Only 253 upstream noncoding sequences of Sarbecovirus are sufficient to identify genetic similarities between species of this subgenus. Furthermore, it was investigated which bat species have commercial value in China, and would thus likely be handled for trading purposes. A number of coronavirus genomes have been published that were obtained from such bat species. These bats are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and their handling poses a potential risk to cause zoonotic coronavirus epidemics.

2483	"In this note we analyze the temporal dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China, Italy and France in the time window 22/01 − 11/03/2020. A first analysis of simple day lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean field models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals.
The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible infected recovered deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable.
The model places the peak in Italy around March 21 st 2020, with a maximum number of infected individuals of about 15,000 and a number of deaths at the end of the epidemics of about 9,300, consistent with figures typical of seasonal flu epidemics. Since the confirmed cases are believed to be between 10 and 20 % of the real number of individuals who eventually get infected, the apparent mortality rate of COVID 19 falls between 3 % and 7 % in Italy, while it appears substantially lower, between 1 % and 3 % in China.
Based on our calculations, we estimate that 2000 ventilation units should represent a fair figure for the peak requirement to be considered by health authorities in Italy for their strategic planning. Finally, a simulation of the effects of drastic containment measures on the outbreak in Italy indicates that a reduction of the infection rate indeed causes a quench of the epidemic peak. However, it is also seen that the infection rate needs to be cut down drastically and quickly to observe an appreciable decrease of the epidemic peak and mortality rate. This appears only possible through a concerted and disciplined, albeit painful, effort of the population as a whole. * Duccio.Fanelli@unifi.it † Francesco.Piazza@cnrs orleans.fr arXiv:2003.06031v1 [q bio.PE] "	0
2484	"While the number of COVID 19 cases and deaths around the world is starting to peak, it is essential to point out how different countries manage the outbreak and how different measures and experience resulted in different outcomes. This study aimed to compare the effect of the measures taken by Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom (UK) governments on the outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic as predicted by a mathematical model.
Data on the numbers of cases, deaths and government measures were collected from Saudi's Ministry of Health and Public Health England. A prediction of the trend of cases, deaths and days to peak was then modelled using the mathematical technique, Exponential Logistic Growth and Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model. The measures taken by the governments and the predicted outcomes were compared to assess effectiveness.
We found over three months that 22 fast and extreme measures had been taken in Saudi Arabia compared to eight slow and late measures in the UK. This resulted in a decline in numbers of current infected cases per day and mortality in Saudi Arabia compared to the UK.
Based on the SIR model, the predicted number of COVID 19 cases in Saudi as of 31st of March was 2,064, while the predicted number of cases was 63012 in the UK. In addition, the pandemic is predicted to peak earlier on the 27th of March in Saudi Arabia compared to the 2nd of May 2020 in the UK. The end of transition phases for Saudi and UK according to the model, were predicted to be on 18th of April and 24th of May, respectively. These numbers relate to early and decisive measures adopted by the Saudi government.
We show that early extreme measures, informed by science and guided by experience, helped reduce the spread and related deaths from COVID 19 in Saudi. Actions were taken by Saudi under the national slogan ""We are all responsible"" resulted in the observed reduced number of current and predicted cases and deaths compared to the UK approach ""keep calm and carry on""."	0
2485	"In response to the current urgent demand for N95 respirators by healthcare workers responding to the COVID 19 pandemic, with particular emphasis on needs within local medical systems, we initiated an N95 decontamination study using aerosolized hydrogen peroxide or aHP (7% H2O2 solution), via the Pathogo Curis® (Curis) decontamination system. The study has thus far included 10 cycles of respirator decontamination, with periodic qualitative and quantitative fit testing to verify ongoing respirator integrity through the decontamination process, and support a statistical evaluation of successful respirator fit. In addition, we have conducted virologic testing of respirator surfaces and materials to demonstrate a rigorous verification of decontamination.
Given that the current pandemic entails a respiratory viral pathogen, it is critical to address these aspects of respirator safety for reuse. These measures are intended to provide a foundation for a suitable decontamination process, which maintains N95 function, and supports safe respirator reuse by healthcare providers. Current results from both respirator fit testing and virologic testing indicate that the process is effective on the basis of zero failure rate on fit testing of selected respirators, and on complete decontamination of multiple virus species by aHP treatment, sterilization."	0
2486	"Using a Bayesian approach to epidemiological compartmental modeling, we demonstrate the ""bomb like"" behavior of exponential growth in COVID 19 cases can be explained by transmission of asymptomatic and mild cases that are typically unreported at the beginning of pandemic events due to lower prevalence of testing. We studied the exponential phase of the pandemic in Italy, Spain, and South Korea, and found the R0 to be 2.56 (95% CrI, 2.41 2.71), 3.23 (95% CrI, 3.06 3.4), and 2.36 (95% CrI, 2.22 2.5) if we use Bayesian priors that assume a large portion of cases are not detected. Weaker priors regarding the detection rate resulted in R0 values of 9.22 (95% CrI, 9.01 9.43), 9.14 (95% CrI, 8.99 9.29), and 8.06 (95% CrI, 7.82 8.3) and assumes nearly 90% of infected patients are identified. Given the mounting evidence that potentially large fractions of the population are asymptomatic, the weaker priors that generate the high R0 values to fit the data required assumptions about the epidemiology of COVID 19 that do not fit with the biology, particularly regarding the timeframe that people remain infectious. Our results suggest that models of transmission assuming a relatively lower R0 value that do not consider a large number of asymptomatic cases can result in outcomes."	0

Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS CoV 2), a novel betacoronavirus, has caused an outburst of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. We report the production of specific IgM and IgG antibodies after the infection of SARS CoV 2 and its implication for the diagnosis, pathology and the course of the disease as well as the recurrence of positive nucleic acid tests after discharge.
Methods: Test results for SARS CoV 2 IgM and IgG antibodies of 221 confirmed COVID 19 patients were retrospectively examined, and their clinical data were collected and analyzed based on various subgroups. SARS CoV 2 IgM and IgG antibodies were determined with the chemiluminescence method. Findings: The concentration (S/CO) of SARS CoV 2 IgM and IgG antibodies peaked on day 19 21 after symptom onset, with a median of 17.38 (IQR 4.39 36.4) for IgM and 5.59 (IQR 0.73 13.65) for IgG.
Detection rates reached highest on day 16 18 and day 19 21 for IgM and IgG, which were 73.6% and 98.6%, respectively, with significantly higher concentration of IgG in critically ill patients than in those with mild to moderate disease (P=0.027). The concentration of the antibodies on day 16 21 is not correlated with the course or outcome of the disease (Spearman r < 0.20, P > 0.05). Nasopharyngeal swabs revealed positive SARS CoV 2 RNA in up to 52.7% of recovered patients after discharge, whose IgG proved to be significantly lower than that of those with negative RNA results (P = 0.009). IgG and IgM were tested twice within 14 days after discharge with a 7 day interval, and the second testing of these antibodies displayed a decrease in concentration of 21.2% (IQR, 11.2%，34.48%) for IgG and 23.05% (IQR,  27.96%，46.13%) for IgM, without statistical significance between the patients with redetectable positive RNA results and those with negative RNA results after discharge. However, those with positive results experienced a count decrease in lymphocyte subsets.
Interpretation: The concentration of SARS CoV 2 IgM and IgG antibodies peaked on day 19 21 after symptom onset, and antibody testing on day 16 21 is associated with increased detection rates, but the antibody concentration does not affect the course and outcome of the infection. Recovering patients with re detectable positive SARS CoV 2 RNA displayed lower concentration of IgG, but the downward trend of IgG during recovery indicated its limited duration of protection, and the protective effect of IgG remains to be investigated.

2491	"Background: With the worldwide outbreak of COVID 19, an accurate model to predict how the coronavirus pandemic will evolve in individual countries becomes important and urgent. Our goal is to provide a prediction model to help policy makers in different countries address the epidemic outbreak and adjust the control policies to contain the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS Cov 2) more effectively.
Methods: Unlike the classic public health and virus propagation models, this new projection model takes both government intervention and public response into account to generate reliable projections of the outbreak 10 days to 2 weeks in advance. This method is an observation based projection similar than the classic Moore's Law in miroelectronics. The Moore's law is not based on any physics law and yet has anticipated the development of microelectronics for decades. This work is an empirical relation to decribe the evolution of epidemic to pandemic situations in different countries. The country was selected as an observation unit because the regulation and political decision is an national decision for numerous measures such as the implementation of social distancing, the quarantine of suspected cases, and the closing of borders to achieve territorial containment.
China. Then the model was also validated by the South Korean data. With a reduction of cases calculated as reduction coefficient of the increase rate of daily cases Rc = 2% per day, we observed a very efficient policy with a strict systematic control in both China and South Korea. For the moment, the Canada, USA, Australia may have difficulties to limit the fast evolution of the epidemic. With a Rc<0.5%, it's particularly important for the USA to consider escalating the control measures because the affected cases can reach more than one million very soon.
Interpertation: Due to the difference of national disciplines and historical culture, the national policy may be implemented and observed with different efficiency. The starting point where the government decided to apply total containment can also play a key role for the evolution of the pendemic situation. The model will allow each national government of the nations still affected by the pandemic to project the situation for the coming 10 to 14 days. It's very important for the deployment of national and international efforts to stop the pandemic situation."	0

Previous studies with calves and other species have provided evidence that blood serum derived proteins and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) may benefit intestinal health. We assessed the effects of supplementing products containing serum proteins as a component of arrival fluid support or serum proteins plus FOS (in addition to additional solids, minerals, and vitamins) in an early life dietary supplement on performance, morbidity, and mortality of stressed (transport, cold) male calves. Male Holstein calves (n = 93) <1 wk old were stratified by arrival body weight (BW) and plasma protein concentration, and then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of one time administration of fluid support [either control electrolyte solution (E) or the serum protein containing arrival formula (AF)] and 14 d of either no supplementation (NG) or supplementation with Gammulin (G; APC Inc., Ankeny, IA), which contains serum proteins and FOS in addition to other solids, minerals, and vitamins. Upon arrival at the research facility, calves were orally administered either AF or E. At the next feeding, half of the calves from each fluid support treatment received either milk replacer (20% crude protein, 20% fat) or the same milk replacer supplemented with G (50 g/d during the first 14 d). Starter and water were freely available. Feed offered and refused was recorded daily. Calf health was assessed by daily assignment of fecal and respiratory scores. Stature measures and BW were determined weekly. Blood samples were obtained at d 0 (before treatments), 2, 7, 14, and 28. Calves were weaned at d 42 and remained in the experiment until d 56. After 2 wk of treatments, calves previously fed AF had greater body length (66.6 vs. 66.0 cm), intakes of dry matter (38.7 vs. 23.5 g/d) and crude protein (9.2 vs. 5.6 g/d) from starter, and cortisol concentration in blood (17.0 vs. 13.9 ng/mL) than calves fed E. Supplementation with G resulted in greater BW gain during the first 2 wk, increased intakes of dry matter and CP, and decreased respiratory scores. For the 8 wk experiment, G supplementation resulted in lower mean fecal score (1.6 vs. 1.8) and fewer antibiotic treatments per calf (1.5 vs. 2.5) than NG. Survival was greater in G than in NG calves (98 vs. 84%). Despite the marked reduction in morbidity and mortality, blood indicators of acute phase response, urea N, and total protein were not affected by AF or G in transported cold stressed male calves."	0

2496	"The Ambulatory Surgery Center Association has a checklist for ASFs to document their inventory (Figure).2
Certain types of ASFs could help decompress hospitals by performing selected essential (urgent and emergent) surgical procedures, which would free up operating rooms, supplies, and personnel in acute care hospitals. Similarly, aggressive pain prophylaxis with nonopioid analgesics such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs as well as local/regional analgesia is important to limit postoperative opioid requirements and avoid opioid–related adverse events―particularly respiratory depression and airway obstruction, which might require supplementary oxygen and airway manipulation/instrumentation. If an airway filter option is not available, and the efficiency of water trap filter cannot be confirmed, a 0.2 μm drug injection filter similar to that used in epidural analgesia kits can be placed between the water trap and the patient and reused after wiping the surface.12 If it is not possible to filter the sampled air for expired CO2, it may be necessary to monitor ventilation by other means such as a precordial stethoscope or stethoscope placed on the neck."	0
2497	"To screen for COVID 19 patients in immigration using minimal nucleic acid testing (NAT). Methods: In the first phase, nasopharyngeal swab samples from the inbound population were numbered and grouped. The samples in the group were mixed together, and a NAT test was performed. When the test result is negative, it means that everyone in the group is not infected and the screening of the group is complete. When the test results were positive, the group moved on to the second stage. In the second stage, all samples in the positive group will be tested individually for NAT.
The advantages and considerations of the method are discussed. Prevalence in the incoming population was a determinant of the sample size within the group. The lower the incidence, the larger the sample size within the group, the higher the savings in NAT and testing costs.
This method has significant efficiency and cost advantages in COVID 19 screening. It can also be used to screen other populations, such as community populations and people at high risk of infection, etc."	0

2501	"In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease was identified in Wuhan, China and, later on, detected in other parts of China. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model.
A novel COVID 19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. COVID 19 daily data of mainland China excluding Hubei province, including the cumulative confirmed cases, the cumulative deaths, newly confirmed cases and the cumulative recovered cases for the period January 20th March 3rd, 2020, were archived from the National Health Commission of China (NHCC). We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number R c , as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio R e (t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province. Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that R c is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20 3.64) and R e (t) has dropped below 1 since January 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID 19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we prove that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020.
To ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in mainland China apart from Hubei province."	0

2504	There is currently an urgent unmet need to increase coronavirus disease 2019 testing capability to effectively respond to the COVID 19 pandemic. However, the current shortage in RNA extraction reagents as well as limitations in qPCR protocols have resulted in bottlenecks in testing capacity. Herein, we describe a novel molecular diagnostic for COVID 19 based on Sanger sequencing. This assay uses the addition of a frame shifted spike in, a modified PCR master mix, and custom Sanger sequencing data analysis to detect and quantify SARS CoV 2 RNA at a limit of detection comparable to existing qPCR based assays, at 10 20 genome copy equivalents. Crucially, our assay was able to detect SARS CoV 2 RNA from viral particles suspended in transport media that was directly added to the PCR master mix, suggesting that RNA extraction can be skipped entirely without any degradation of test performance. Since Sanger sequencing instruments are widespread in clinical laboratories and commonly have built in liquid handling automation to support up to 3840 samples per instrument per day, the widespread adoption of qSanger COVID 19 US.	0

Methods: By reinterpreting the data in the article ""Diagnostic Value of Combined Detection of Serum 2019 novel coronavirus IgM and IgG Antibodies in novel coronavirusin Infection"", the positive likelihood ratio of IgM and IgG antibody in diagnosis of COVID 19 (nucleic acid positive patients) was calculated, and the posterior probability of IgM and IgG antibodies and their tandem detection to diagnose was finally calculated. Results: The positive likelihood ratios of single IgM and IgG antibody were 18.50 and 12.65 respectively, and the posterior probabilities were 90.18% and 86.26% respectively. However, the posterior probability of the two antibodies tandem detection is 99.15%, which can give clinicians quantitative confidence in the diagnosis of COVID 19 from suspected cases. According to the results of this study, combining the advantages and disadvantages of nucleic acid detection and antibody detection, the clinical pathway for clinicians to diagnose COVID 19 is found. Conclusion: For suspected cases, IgM and IgG antibody tests should be firstly done at the same time. If the antibody tests are all positive, COVID 19 can be confirmed. If not, nucleic acid detection (one or more times) is performed."	0

2508	An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) infection and its caused coronavirus disease 2019 has been reported in China since December 2019. More than 16% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the fatality ratio was about 1% 2%. No specific treatment has been reported. Herein, we examine the effects of Favipiravir (FPV) versus Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) for the treatment of COVID 19. Patients with laboratory confirmed COVID 19 who received oral FPV (Day 1: 1600 mg twice daily; Days 2 14: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon (IFN) a by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the FPV arm of this study, whereas patients who were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1 14: 400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus IFN a by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the control arm. Changes in chest computed tomography (CT), viral clearance, and drug safety were compared between the two groups. For the 35 patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms. A shorter viral clearance time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (median (interquartile range, IQR), 4 (2.5 9) d versus 11 (8 13) d, P < 0.001). The FPV arm also showed significant improvement in chest imaging compared with the control arm, with an improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (P = 0.004). After adjustment for potential confounders, the FPV arm also showed a significantly higher improvement rate in chest imaging. Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV was independently associated with faster viral clearance. In addition, fewer adverse reactions were found in the FPV arm than in the control arm. In this open label nonrandomized control study, FPV showed significantly better treatment effects on COVID 19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance; if causal, these results should be important information for establishing standard treatment guidelines to combat the SARS CoV 2 infection.	0
2509	Today, tracking and controlling the spread of a virus is a crucial need for almost all countries. Doing this early would save millions of lives and help countries keep a stable economy. The easiest way to control the spread of a virus is to immediately inform the individuals who recently had close contact with the diagnosed patients. However, to achieve this, a centralized authority (e.g., a health authority) needs detailed location information from both healthy individuals and diagnosed patients. Thus, such an approach, although beneficial to control the spread of a virus, results in serious privacy concerns, and hence privacy preserving solutions are required to solve this problem. Previous works on this topic either (i) compromise privacy (especially privacy of diagnosed patients) to have better efficiency or (ii) provide unscalable solutions. In this work, we propose a technique based on private set intersection between physical contact histories of individuals (that are recorded using smart phones) and a centralized database (run by a health authority) that keeps the identities of the positive diagnosed patients for the disease. Proposed solution protects the location privacy of both healthy individuals and diagnosed patients and it guarantees that the identities of the diagnosed patients remain hidden from other individuals. Notably, proposed scheme allows individuals to receive warning messages indicating their previous contacts with a positive diagnosed patient. Such warning messages will help them realize the risk and isolate themselves from other people. We make sure that the warning messages are only observed by the corresponding individuals and not by the health authority. We also implement the proposed scheme and show its efficiency and scalability via simulations.	0
2510	Background and Rationale: Amid SARS CoV 2 outbreak, the low number of infections	1
2511	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 is spreading in Japan. We have collected a total of 26 patients with COVID 19 who required extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO). The available data from the first 14 cases demonstrated that the median age of patients was 71 and the median PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio, positive end expiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, and lung compliance were 70, 15 cmH 2 O, 21 cmH 2 O, and 28 mL/cmH 2 O, respectively. Median serum KL 6 level was 333 U/mL. Consequently, 16 (62%) out of the 26 have been weaned off and 6 (26%) have been extubated and on rehabilitation, while the other 10 (38%) remain on ECMO. There seemed to be two phenotypes of COVID 19: one with impaired lung compliance and one with preserved lung compliance. The latter phenotype was likely to be favored from the use of ECMO. Further investigation is necessary 19.	0
2512	Background: Few data are available on the rate and characteristics of thromboembolic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID 19. Methods: We studied consecutive symptomatic patients with laboratory proven COVID 19 admitted to a university hospital in Milan, Italy (13.02.2020 10.04.2020). The primary outcome was any thromboembolic complication, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), ischemic stroke, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/ myocardial infarction (MI). Secondary outcome was overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Results: We included 388 patients (median age 66 years, 68% men, 16% requiring intensive care [ICU]). Thromboprophylaxis was used in 100% of ICU patients and 75% of those on the general ward. Thromboembolic events occurred in 28 (7.7% of closed cases; 95%CI 5.4% 11.0%), corresponding to a cumulative rate of 21% (27.6% ICU, 6.6% general ward). Half of the thromboembolic events were diagnosed within 24 h of hospital admission. Forty four patients underwent VTE imaging tests and VTE was confirmed in 16 (36%). Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed in 30 patients, corresponding to 7.7% of total, and pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 10 (33% of CTPA). The rate of ischemic stroke and ACS/MI was 2.5% and 1.1%, respectively. Overt DIC was present in 8 (2.2%) patients. Conclusions: The high number of arterial and, in particular, venous thromboembolic events diagnosed within 24 h of admission and the high rate of positive VTE imaging tests among the few COVID 19 patients tested suggest that there is an urgent need to improve specific VTE diagnostic strategies and investigate the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory COVID 19 patients.	0
2513	"Effective screening for patients is important to limit the epidemic. However, some defects make the currently applied diagnosis methods are still not very ideal for early warning of patients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model that allows for the quick screening of highly suspected patients using easy to get variables.
A total of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positive result were classified into COVID 19 group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct the diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for model validation. RESULTS After analysis, signs of pneumonia on CT, history of close contact, fever, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tmax and sex were included in the diagnostic model. Age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into COVID 19 early warning score (COVID 19 EWS). The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) indicated that both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.935 0.977, P < 0.001]; validation dataset 0.960 [95%CI 0.919 1.0, P < 0.001] ) and COVID 19 EWS (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.934 0.978, P < 0.001] ; validate dataset 0.966 [95%CI 0.929 1, P
< 0.001]) had good discrimination capacity. In addition, we also obtained the cut off values of disease severity predictors, such as CT score, CD8   T cell count, CD4   T cell count, and so on.
The new developed COVID 19 EWS was a considerable tool for early and relatively accurately warning of SARS CoV 2 infected patients."	0

2516	Coronaviruses belong to a group of enveloped, positive single stranded RNA viruses that are known to cause severe respiratory distress in animals and humans. The current SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) pandemic has caused more than 2,000,000 infections globally and nearly 200,000 deaths. Coronaviruses enter susceptible cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes after endocytosis of the virus into endosomes. Previous results with SARS and MERS CoV have shown that the Spike (S) glycoprotein is a major determinant of virus infectivity and immunogenicity. Herein, we show that expression of SARS CoV 2 S (S n) glycoprotein after transient transfection of African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells caused extensive cell fusion in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the SARS S (S o) glycoprotein. S n expression was detected intracellularly and on transfected Vero cell surfaces and caused the formation of very large multinucleated cells (syncytia) by 48 hours post transfection. These results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive syncytial formation in lung tissues of COVID 19 patients. This differential S n versus S o mediated cell fusion suggests that SARS CoV 2 is able to spread from cell to cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular spaces and neutralizing antibodies. A systematic screening of several drugs for ability to inhibit S n and S o cell fusion revealed that the FDA approved HIV protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited S n and S o mediated cell fusion in a dose dependent manner. Complete inhibition of cell fusion was observed at a 10 micromolar concentration. Computational modeling and in silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting S n and S o mediated membrane fusion. Also, it is possible that nelfinavir mesylate acts on cellular processes to inhibit S proteolytic processing. These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate as an antiviral drug, especially at early times after SARS CoV 2 symptoms appear.	0
2517	An ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus 2) is hitting Wuhan City and has spread to other provinces/cities of China and overseas. It very 29 urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential 30 total number of confirmed cases in mainland China by applying Boltzmann function based 31 regression analyses. We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 32 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well 33 fitted with the Boltzmann function (R 2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of 34 confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) 35 as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 36 16092), respectively. cases	0
2518	"Importance. Covid 19 infection has major international health and economic impacts and risk factors for infection are not completely understood. Cannabis smoking is linked with poor respiratory health, immunosuppression and multiple contaminants. Potential synergism between the two epidemics would represent a major public health convergence. Cigarettes were implicated with disease severity in Wuhan, China.
Objective. Is cannabis use epidemiologically associated with coronavirus incidence rate (CVIR)?
Design. Cross sectional state based multivariable study.
Setting. USA.
Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures. CVIR. Multivariable adjusted geospatiallyweighted regression models. As the American cannabis epidemic is characterized by a recent doubling of daily cannabis use it was considered important to characterize the contribution of high intensity use.
Results. Significant associations of daily cannabis use quintile with CVIR were identified with the highest quintile having a prevalence ratio 5.11 (95%C.I. 4.90 5.33), an attributable fraction in the exposed (AFE) 80.45% (79.61 81.25%) and an attributable fraction in the population of 77.80% (76.88 78.68%) with Chi squared for trend (14,782, df=4) significant at P<10  500 . Similarly when cannabis legalization was considered decriminalization was associated with an elevated CVIR prevalence ratio 4.51 (95%C.I. 4.45 4.58), AFE 77.84% (77.50 78.17%) and Chi squared for trend (56,679, df=2) significant at P<10  500 . Monthly and daily use were linked with CVIR in bivariate geospatial regression models (P=0.0027, P=0.0059). In multivariable additive models number of flight origins and population density were significant. In interactive geospatial models adjusted for international travel, ethnicity, income, population, population density and drug use, terms including last month cannabis were significant from P=7.3x10  15 , daily cannabis use from P=7.3x10  11 and last month cannabis was independently associated (P=0.0365)."	0

The novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high resolution real time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus."	1
2521	Procedures putting healthcare workers in close contact with the airway are particularly at risk of contamination by the SARS Cov 2 virus, especially when exposed to sputum, coughing, or a tracheostomy. In the current pandemic phase, all patients should be considered as potentially infected. Thus, the level of precaution recommended for the caregivers depends more on the type of procedure than on the patient's proved or suspected COVID 19 status. Procedures that are particularly at high risk of contamination are clinical and flexible endoscopic pharyngolaryngological evaluation, and probably also video fluoroscopic swallowing exams. Voice rehabilitation should not be considered urgent at this time. Therefore, recommendations presented here mainly concern the management of swallowing disorders, which can sometimes be dangerous for the patient, and recent dysphonia. In cases where they are considered possible and useful, teleconsultations should be preferred to face to face assessments or rehabilitation sessions. The latter must be maintained only in few selected situations, after team discussions or in accordance with the guidelines provided by health authorities.	0
2522	"An effective vaccine for hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major unmet need, and it requires an antigen that elicits immune responses to key conserved epitopes. Based on structures of antibodies targeting HCV envelope glycoprotein E2, we designed immunogens to modulate the structure and dynamics of E2 and favor induction of bNAbs in the context of a vaccine. These designs include a point mutation in a key conserved antigenic site to stabilize its conformation, as well as redesigns of an immunogenic region to add a new N glycosylation site and mask it from antibody binding.
Designs were experimentally characterized for binding to a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (HMAbs) and the coreceptor CD81 to confirm preservation of epitope structure and preferred antigenicity profile. Selected E2 designs were tested for immunogenicity in mice, with and without hypervariable region 1, which is an immunogenic region associated with viral escape. One of these designs showed improvement in polyclonal immune serum binding to HCV pseudoparticles and neutralization of isolates associated with antibody resistance. These results indicate that antigen optimization through structure based design of the envelope glycoproteins is a promising route to an effective permission."	0

2531	People infected with malaria may receive less mosquito bites when they are treated in well equipped hospitals or follow doctors' advice for reducing exposure to mosquitoes at home. This quarantine like intervention measure is especially feasible in countries and areas approaching malaria elimination. Motivated by mathematical models with quarantine for directly transmitted diseases, we develop a mosquito borne disease model where imperfect quarantine is considered to mitigate the disease transmission from infected humans to susceptible mosquitoes. The basic reproduction number R 0 is computed and the model equilibria and their stabilities are analyzed when the incidence rate is standard or bilinear. In particular, the model system may undergo a subcritical (backward) bifurcation at R 0 = 1 when standard incidence is adopted, whereas the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable as R 0 ≤ 1 and the unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable as R 0 > 1 when the infection incidence is bilinear. Numerical simulations suggest that the quarantine strategy can play an important role in decreasing malaria transmission. The success of quarantine mainly relies on the reduction of bites on quarantined individuals.	0
2532	"We have assembled a cohort consisting 504 hospitalized COVID 19. Information of patients' characteristics and antiviral medication use during hospital stay is collected. The study objective is to evaluate the treatment efficacy of selected antiviral medications on mortality and lesion absorption based on chest CT scan.
The overall mortality rate was 15.67% in the cohort. Older age, lower SpO2 level, bigger lesion, early admission data, and the presence of pre existing conditions were associated with higher mortality. After adjusting for sex, pre existing condition, age, SpO2, lesion size, admission data, hospital, and anti viral medications use, Arbidol and Oseltamivir use is associated with a reduction in mortality. The OR is 0.183 (95% CI, 0.075 to 0.446; p<0.001) for Arbidol and 0.220 (95% CI, 0.069 to 0.707; p=0.011) for Oseltamivir. Compared with patients taking neither Arbidol nor Oseltamivir, the OR is 0.253 (95% CI, 0.064 to 1.001; p=0.050) for patients taking Oseltamivir only; 0.190 (95% CI, 0.076 to 0.473; p<0.001) for patients taking Arbidol only; and 0.030 (95% CI, 0.003 to 0.310; p=0.003) for patients taking both, after adjusting for patients' characteristics and Lopinavir/Ritonavir use. Similarly, Arbidol is also associated with faster lesion absorption use."	0

We also searched following websites: the WHO (https://www.who.int/), CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/), NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, https://www.nice.org.uk/), National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (http://www.satcm.gov.cn/). Those who have one of the following contacts after the onset of confirmed cases in the absence of effective protection [18]: (1) those who live, study, work, or have close contact with the confirmed cases, or other close contacts such as working closely with or sharing the same classroom or living in the same house with the confirmed case.

The next generation sequencing (NGS) and electron microscope technology play a role in the early diagnosis, but their diagnostic values have been weakened by the discovery of specific nucleic acid detection technology.

2540	"Background: the COVID 19 has been successfully contained in China but is spreading all over the world. We use phenomenological models to dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province.
We use the experience from China to analyze the calibration results on Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Europe, and make future scenario projections. Methods: we calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized Richards model to the reported number of infected cases from Jan. 19 to March 10 for the whole of China, 29 provinces in China, four severely affected countries and Europe as a whole. The different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions. Results: We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogeneous situations across provinces. Based on Chinese experience, we identify a high risk in Japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of March 25 being 1574 (95% CI: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% CI: [988, 11340]) by June. For South Korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% CI: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. We estimate 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of Italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. We would expect 114867 people infected in Europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% European population.
The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. For other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. Japan and Italy are in serious situations with 3 no short term end to the outbreak to be expected. There is a significant risk concerning the upcoming July 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Iran's situation is highly uncertain with unclear and negative future scenarios, while South Korea is approaching the end of the outbreak. Both Europe and the USA are at early stages of the outbreak, posing significant health and economic risks to the world in the absence of serious measures."	0
2541	The novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2), identified in China at the end of December 2019 and causing the disease COVID 19, has meanwhile led to outbreaks all over the globe with about 2.2 million confirmed cases and more than 150,000 deaths as of April 17, 2020 [37]. In view of most recent information on testing activity [32], we present here an update of our initial work [4] . In this work, mathematical models have been developed to study the spread of COVID 19 among the population in Germany and to asses the impact of non pharmaceutical interventions. Systems of differential equations of SEIR type are extended here to account for undetected infections, as well as for stages groups. The models are calibrated on data until April 5, data from April 6 to 14 are used for model validation. We simulate different possible strategies for the mitigation of the current outbreak, slowing down the spread of the virus and thus reducing the peak in daily diagnosed cases, the demand for hospitalization or intensive care units admissions, and eventually the number of fatalities. Our results suggest that a partial (and gradual) lifting of introduced control measures could soon be possible if accompanied by further increased testing activity, strict isolation of detected cases and reduced contact to risk groups.	1
2542	Under the global pandemic of COVID 19, the use of artificial intelligence to analyze chest X ray (CXR) image for COVID 19 diagnosis and patient triage is becoming important. Unfortunately, due to the emergent nature of the COVID 19 pandemic, a systematic collection of the CXR data set for deep neural network training is difficult. To address this problem, here we propose a patch based convolutional neural network approach with a relatively small number of trainable parameters for COVID 19 diagnosis. The proposed method is inspired by our statistical analysis of the potential imaging biomarkers of the CXR radiographs. Experimental results show that our method achieves state of the art performance and provides clinically interpretable saliency maps, which are useful	1
2543	This paper presents two epidemiological models that have been developed in order to study the disease dynamics of the COVID 19 pandemic and exit strategies from the lockdown which has been imposed on many countries world wide. A strategy is needed such that both the health system is not overloaded letting people die in an uncontrolled way and also such that the majority of people can get back their social contacts as soon as possible. We investigate the potential effects of a combination of measures such as continuation of hygienic constraints after leaving lockdown, isolation of infectious persons, repeated and adaptive short term contact reductions and also large scale use of antibody tests in order to know who can be assumed to be immune and participate at public life without constraints. We apply two commonly used modeling approaches: extended SEIR models formulated both as System Dynamics and Agent Based Simulation, in order to get insight into the disease dynamics of a complete country like Germany and also into more detailed behavior of smaller regions. We confirm the findings of other models that without intervention the consequences of the pandemic can be catastrophic and we extend such findings with effective strategies to overcome the challenge. Based on the modeling assumptions it can be expected that repeated short term contact reductions will be necessary in the next years to avoid overload of the health system and that on the other side herd immunity can be achieved and antibody tests are an effective way to mitigate the contact reductions for many.	0

2545	"Objectives: To describe the pharmacy administration and pharmaceutical care in a module hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) epidemic and provide reference for domestic and foreign pharmacists participating in the epidemic prevention and control. Setting: The study was performed in a Jianghan module hospital constructed at the Wuhan Convention and Exhibition Center in Wuhan, China. This is 1 of the first 3 module hospitals. Practice description: One thousand eight hundred forty eight patients were admitted to the Jianghan module hospital, and 1327 cases (71.81% of the total number) were cured and discharged. Pharmacists have successfully completed the tasks of purchase, storage, and free distribution of drugs worth ¥1.03 million (approximately $146,000), reviewed about 20,000 electronic orders, provided one on one online medication consultation for 484 patients, and held 5 lectures on rational drug use knowledge, which could help reduce irrational drug use and minimize the risk involved. Practice innovation: The new COVID 19 ""module"" pharmaceutical care model is equipped with new features such as pharmacy emergency command group, organizational structure for pharmacy administration, electronic control of drug prescription, and ""zero contact"" pharmaceutical care relying on the new media platform ""WeChat."" This platform provides relevant pharmaceutical care for patients, such as ensuring drug supply, setting up critical care drug trolleys, designing specific drug packaging bags, creating a module radio station to broadcast rational drug use information to the patients, and other aspects. Evaluation: With the continuous improvement of the module hospital and the progress in indepth knowledge about COVID 19, some aspects such as patient admission criteria and variety of drugs need to be adjusted depending on the actual situation. Results: The pharmacists provided pharmaceutical care for 1848 patients with mild COVID 19 disease. They not only ensured the timely supply of the drugs but also reduced the incidence of drug induced risks through medication review and guidance, thereby improving patient compliance and helping the patients rebuild their confidence in overcoming the disease. Conclusion: The new COVID 19 module pharmaceutical care model has played an important role in overcoming the epidemic situation of COVID 19 in China and thus can be implemented on a broader scale."	0

2547	This paper deals with an advanced analytical epidemic diffusion model which is capable to predict the status of epidemic impacts. This newly propose model well describes an epidemic growth and it could be widely applied into various topics including pathology, epidemiology, business and data sciences. The Advanced Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model (AAEDM) is a dynamic diffusion prediction model which is theoretically intuitive and its tractable closed formula could be easily adapted into versatile Bigdata driven analytics including the machine learning system. This dynamic model is still an analytical model but the periods of prediction are segmented for adapting the values from the dataset when the data is available. The epidemiologically vital parameters which effect on the AAEDM are also introduced in this paper. The evaluation of this theoretical model based on the Covid 19 data in Korea has been accomplished with relative fair future prediction accuracies. Although this analytical model has been designed from a basic exponential growth model, the performance of the AAEDM is competitive with other Bigdata based simulation models. Since the AAEDM is relatively simple and handy, anyone can use this model into analyzing outbreak situations in his daily life.	0
2548	"Background: With the spreading global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 there has been disruption to normal clinical activity in response to the increased demand on health services.
There are reports of a reduction in non Covid 19 emergency presentations. Consequentially, there are concerns that deaths from non Covid 19 causes could increase. We examined recent reported population based mortality rates, compared with expected rates, and compared any excess in deaths with the number of deaths attributed to Covid 19.
Methods: National agency and death registration reports were searched for numbers of deaths attributed to Covid 19 and overall mortality that had been publicly reported by 22 April 2020. Data on the number of deaths attributed to Covid 19, the total number of deaths registered in the population and the historical average over at least 3 years were collected. Data were available for 3 Northern European countries (England & Wales, Scotland and the Netherlands) and New York State, United States of America.
There was an increase in observed, compared with expected, mortality in Scotland ( 73%), England and Wales ( 49%), the Netherlands ( 65%) and New York state ( 34%). Of these deaths, only 65% in Scotland, 68 % in England and Wales, 49% in the Netherlands and 73% in New York state were attributed to Covid 19 leaving a number of excess deaths not attributed to Covid 19."	0

We aimed to evaluate the correlation of ARBs/ACEIs usage with the pathogenesis of COVID 19 in a retrospective, single center study. 126 COVID 19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACEIs group (n=43) and non ARBs/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. 125 age and sex matched COVID 19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non hypertension controls. In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID 19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups. The frequency of ARBs/ACEIs usage in hypertension patients with or without COVID 19 were comparable.
Among COVID 19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACEIs or non ARBs/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure. However, ARBs/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008).
Furthermore, much lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% vs 22.9%; p=0.061), and a lower death rate (4.7% vs 13.3%; p=0.216) were observed in ARBs/ACEIs group than non ARBs/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance.

2550	"Background: Epidemiological data from the COVID 19 pandemic has 27 demonstrated variability in attack rates by age, and country to country 28 variability in case fatality ratio (CFR).
Objective: To use direct and indirect standardization for insights into the 30 impact of age specific under reporting on between country variability in CFR, 31 and apparent size of COVID 19 epidemics.
32 Design: Post hoc secondary data analysis (""case studies""), and mathematical 33 modeling.
34 Setting: China, global.
35 Interventions: None.
36 Measurements: Data were extracted from a sentinel epidemiological study by 37 the Chinese Center for Disease Control (CCDC) that describes attack rates and 38 CFR for COVID 19 in China prior to February 12, 2020. Standardized 39 morbidity ratios (SMR) were used to impute missing cases and adjust CFR. 40 Age specific attack rates and CFR were applied to different countries with 41 differing age structures (Italy, Japan, Indonesia, and Egypt), in order to 42 generate estimates for CFR, apparent epidemic size, and time to outbreak 43 recognition for identical age specific attack rates. 44 Results: SMR demonstrated that 50 70% of cases were likely missed during the 45 Chinese epidemic.

2551	This paper revisits the offline change point detection problem from a statistical learning perspective. Instead of assuming that the underlying pre and post change distributions are known, it is assumed that we have partial knowledge of these distributions sequences. Our problem formulation finds a variety of real life applications from detecting when climate change occurred to detecting when a virus mutated. Using the training sequences as well as the test sequence consisting of a single change and allowing for the erasure or rejection option, we derive the optimal resolution between the estimated and true change points under two different asymptotic regimes on the undetected error probability namely, the large and moderate deviations regimes. In both regimes, strong converses are also proved. In the moderate deviations case, the optimal resolution is a simple function of a symmetrized version of the chi square distance.	1

We include the timing of each state's implementation of interventions including encouraging social distancing, closing schools, banning public events, and a lockdown / stay at home order. We assume fatalities are reported correctly and infer the number and timing of infections based on the infection fatality rate measured in populations that were tested universally for SARS CoV 2. Underreporting of deaths would drive our estimates to be too low. Reporting of deaths on the wrong day could drive errors in either direction. This model does not include effects of herd immunity; in states where the estimated infection rate is very high."	0

The latter prevents farmers from going bankrupt after a zoonoses outbreak. This paper describes the development of a fabrication process and the proof of principle of a disposable DNA amplification chip with an integrated heater. Based on the analysis of the milling process, metal adhesion studies, and COMSOL MultiPhysics heat transfer simulations, the first batch of chips has been fabricated and successful multiple displacement amplification reactions are performed inside these chips. This research is the first step towards the development of an early stage zoonoses detection device. Tests with real zoonoses and DNA specific amplification reactions still need to be done.	0

There is nothing permanent except change. The emergence of new virus diseases
The sudden appearance of apparently new viruses with pathogenic potential is of fundamental importance in medical microbiology and a constant threat to humans and animals. The emergence of a ""new"" pathogen is not an isolated event, as for instance the frequent appearance of new influenza virus strains demonstrates. Often the new virus strains co circulate with the older strains in a susceptible population, but a replacement of the older strains has been also observed. In rare instances the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or most recently, with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The mechanisms of the emergence are not always clearly understood, but an altered host range appears to be a common event. Whether a true change in host range occurs, or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently, is often unknown.
This review tries to summarize the facts that are known about a wide variety of ""new"" viruses of mammals. such as the simian, human and feline Ientiviruses, the feline coronaviruses, the feline parvovintses, the carnivore morbilliviruses, the influenza A viruses, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. A particular emphasis will be put on the genetic mechanisms that might have taken place and that might have been responsible for their sudden appearance.

2555	The COVID 19 pandemic is rapidly spreading throughout the world. Recent reports suggest that 10 30% of SARS CoV 2 infected patients are asymptomatic. Other studies report that some subjects have significant viral shedding prior to symptom onset. Since both asymptomatic and presymptomatic subjects can spread the disease, identifying such individuals is critical for effective control of the SARS CoV 2 pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase diagnostic testing capabilities in order to also screen asymptomatic carriers. In fact, such tests will be routinely required until a vaccine is developed. Yet, a major bottleneck of managing the COVID 19 pandemic in many countries is diagnostic testing, due to limited laboratory capabilities as well as limited access to genome extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) reagents. We developed P BEST  a method for Pooling Based Efficient SARS CoV 2 Testing, using a non adaptive grouptesting approach, which significantly reduces the number of tests required to identify all positive subjects within a large set of samples. Instead of testing each sample separately, samples are pooled into groups and each pool is tested for SARS CoV 2 using the standard clinically approved PCRbased diagnostic assay. Each sample is part of multiple pools, using a combinatorial pooling strategy based on compressed sensing designed for maximizing the ability to identify all positive individuals. We evaluated P BEST using leftover samples that were previously clinically tested for COVID 19. In our current proof of concept study we pooled 384 patient samples into 48 pools providing an 8 fold increase in testing efficiency. Five sets of 384 samples, containing 1 5 positive carriers were screened and all positive carriers in each set were correctly identified. P BEST provides an efficient and easy to implement solution for increasing testing capacity that will work with any clinically approved genome extraction and PCR based diagnostic methodologies.	0

2558	On Monday, 23 March 2020, Nigeria recorded its first mortality from the novel global COVID 19 outbreak. Before this, the country reported 36 confirmed cases (at the time of writing) and has discharged home two cases after weeks of care at a governmentapproved isolation centre in Lagos State. This first mortality was that of a 67 year old man with a history of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. He was undergoing chemotherapy and had just returned to Nigeria following medical treatment in the United Kingdom. The novel COVID 19 pandemic has grounded several global activities including the provision of health care services to people with chronic conditions such as cancer. Evidence from China suggests that cancer patients with COVID 19 infection are a vulnerable group, with a higher risk of severe illness resulting in intensive care unit admissions or death, particularly if they received chemotherapy or surgery. This letter is an attempt to suggest practicable interventions such as the use of existing digital health platforms to limit patients' and oncology professionals' physical interactions as a way of reducing the risk of COVID 19 infection transmission amongst cancer patients and oncologists, as well as outlining effective strategies outbreak.	0
2559	"In Africa, while most countries report some COVID 19 cases, the fraction of reported patients is low, with about 20 000 cases compared to the more than 2.3 million cases reported globally as of April 18, 2020.
Few African countries have reported case numbers above one thousand, with South Africa reporting 3 034 cases being hit hardest in Sub Saharan Africa. Several African countries, especially South Africa, have already taken strong non pharmaceutical interventions that include physical distancing, restricted economic, educational and leisure activities and reduced human mobility options. The required strengths and overall effectiveness of such interventions, however, are debated because of simultaneous but opposing interests in most African countries: strongly limited health care capacities and testing capabilities largely conflict with pressured national economies and socio economic hardships on the individual level, limiting compliance to intervention targets. Here we investigate implications of interventions on the COVID 19 outbreak dynamics, focusing on South Africa before and after the national lockdown enacted on March 27, 2020. Our analysis shows that initial exponential growth of existing case numbers is consistent with doubling times of about 2.5 days. After lockdown, the growth remains exponential, now with doubling times of 18 days, but still in contrast to subexponential growth reported for Hubei/China after lockdown. Moreover, a scenario analysis of a computational data driven agent based mobility model for the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (with 1.14 million inhabitants) hints that keeping current levels of intervention measures and compliance until the end of April is of insufficient length and still too weak, too unspecific or too inconsistently complied with to not overload local intensive care capacity. Yet, enduring, slightly stronger, more specific interventions combined with sufficient compliance may constitute a viable option for interventions for regions continent."	0

2561	The rapid spread of COVID 19 motivates development of antivirals targeting conserved molecular machinery of the SARS CoV 2 virus. The SARS CoV 2 genome includes conserved RNA elements that offer potential targets for RNA targeting small molecule drugs, but 3D structures of most of these elements have not been experimentally characterized. Here, we provide a dataset called 'FARFAR2 SARS CoV 2', a collection of 3D coordinates modeled using Rosetta's FARFAR2 algorithm, including de novo models for thirteen RNA elements in SARS CoV 2 and homology models for a fourteenth. These elements comprise SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, SL5, putative SL6 and SL7 in the extended 5′ UTR, as well as the entire extended 5′ UTR; the frameshifting element (FSE) from the SARS CoV 2 ORF1a/b gene and a putative dimer of FSE; and the extended pseudoknot, hypervariable region, and the s2m of the 3′ UTR, as well as the entire 3′ UTR. For five of these elements (SL1, SL2, SL3, FSE, s2m), convergence of lowest predicted energy structures supports their accuracy in capturing low energy states that might be targeted for small molecule binding. To aid efforts to discover small molecule RNA binders guided by computational models, we provide a second benchmarking dataset called 'FARFAR2 Apo Riboswitch', which consists of similarly prepared Rosetta FARFAR2 models for RNA riboswitch aptamer regions that bind small molecules. Both datasets include up to 400 3D models for each RNA element, which may facilitate drug discovery molecules.	0

Background: An outbreak of Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, the epidemic is more widespread than initially estimated, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries.
The aim of the meta analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID 19 infection patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non severe patients.
A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of sciences until February 25, 2020. Risk ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random effects models.
Results: Eight studies were included in the meta analysis, including 46248 infected patients. The result showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever ( 91±3, 95% CI 86 97% ), followed by cough (67±7, 95% CI 59 76%), fatigue ( 51±0, 95% CI 34 68% ) and dyspnea ( 30±4, 95% CI 21 40%). The most prevalent comorbidity were hypertension (17±7, 95% CI 14 22%) and diabetes ( 8±6, 95% CI 6 11% ), followed by cardiovascular diseases ( 5±4, 95% CI 4 7% ) and respiratory system disease( 2±0, 95% CI 1 3% ). Compared with the Non severe patient, the pooled odds ratio of hypertension, respiratory system disease, cardiovascular disease in severe patients were (OR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.46 3.83) ,(OR 2.46, 95% CI: 1.76 3.44) and (OR 3.42, 95% CI: 1.88 6.22)respectively.

2568	The cutting edge technology vaccinomics is the combination of two topics immunogenetics and immunogenomics with the knowledge of systems biology and immune profiling for designing vaccine against infectious disease. In our present study, an epitope based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38 47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76 90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA A*01:01 and HLA DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC 50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores  725.0 Kcal/mole and  786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.	0

These permissions are granted for free by Elsevier for as long as the COVID 19 resource centre remains active. Background: Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common complication of a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) in children. The virus induced host inflammatory response in the nasopharynx plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AOM. Suppression of this inflammatory process might prevent the development of AOM as a complication. Objective: We sought to assess the effect of intranasally administered fluticasone propionate on prevention of AOM during a viral respiratory infection. Methods: A total of 210 children (mean age, 2.1 years; range, 0.7 3.9 years) with normal middle ear status and URI of 48 hours' duration or less were randomly allocated to receive either fluticasone (100 µg twice daily) or placebo for 7 days. The specific viral cause of the infection was determined from nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained at the first visit. The children were re examined at the end of the 7 day medication period. Results: In the fluticasone group AOM developed in 40 (38.1%) of 105 children compared with 29 (28.2%) of 103 children receiving placebo (P = .13). The viral cause of the respiratory infection was determined in 167 (86.1%) of 194 children from whom a nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained. In children with rhinovirus infection, AOM developed significantly more often in the fluticasone group (45.7%) than in the placebo group (14.7%, P = .005). Conclusion: Intranasally administered fluticasone does not prevent the development of AOM during URI but may increase the incidence of AOM during rhinovirus infection.

2577	The COVID 19 pandemic demands the rapid identification of drug repurpusing candidates. In the past decade, network medicine had developed a framework consisting of a series of quantitative approaches and predictive tools to study host pathogen interactions, unveil the molecular mechanisms of the infection, identify comorbidities as well as rapidly detect drug repurpusing candidates. Here, we adapt the network based toolset to COVID 19, recovering the primary pulmonary manifestations of the virus in the lung as well as observed comorbidities associated with cardiovascular diseases. We predict that the virus can manifest itself in other tissues, such as the reproductive system, and brain regions, moreover we predict neurological comorbidities. We build on these findings to deploy three network based drug repurposing strategies, relying on network proximity, diffusion, and AI based metrics, allowing to rank all approved 1 arXiv:2004.07229v1 [q bio.MN] 15 Apr 2020 drugs based on their likely efficacy for COVID 19 patients, aggregate all predictions, and, thereby to arrive at 81 promising repurposing candidates.

2581	"Background: The cessation of lock down measures will require an effective testing strategy. Much focus at the beginning of the UK's Covid 19 epidemic was directed to deficiencies in the national testing capacity. The quantity of tests may seem an important focus, but other characteristics are likely more germane. False positive tests are more probable than positive tests when the overall population has a low prevalence of the disease, even with highly accurate tests.
Methods: We modify an SIR model to include quarantines states and test performance using publicly accessible estimates for the current situation. Three scenarios for cessation of lock down measures are explored: (1) immediate end of lock down measures, (2) continued lock down with antibody testing based immunity passports, and (3) incremental relaxation of lock down measures with active viral testing. Sensitivity, specificity, prevalence and test capacity are modified for both active viral and antibody testing to determine their population level effect on the continuing epidemic.
Findings: Diagnostic uncertainty can have a large effect on the epidemic dynamics of Covid 19 within the UK. The dynamics of the epidemic are more sensitive to test performance and targeting than test capacity. The quantity of tests is not a substitute for an effective strategy. Poorly targeted testing has the propensity to exacerbate the peak in infections.
Interpretation: The assessment that 'no test is better than a bad test' is broadly supported by the present analysis. Antibody testing is unlikely to be a solution to the lock down, regardless of test quality or capacity. A well designed active viral testing strategy combined with incremental relaxation of the lock down measures is shown to be a potential strategy to restore some social activity whilst continuing to keep infections low."	0

2589	We propose a novel numerical method able to determine efficiently and effectively the relationship of complementarity between portions of proteins surfaces. This innovative and general procedure, based on the representation of the molecular iso electron density surface in terms of 2D Zernike polynomials, allows the rapid and quantitative assessment of the geometrical shape complementarity between interacting proteins, that was unfeasible with previous methods. We first tested the method with a large dataset of known protein complexes obtaining an overall area under the ROC curve of 0.69 in the blind recognition of binding sites and then applied it to investigate the features of the interaction between the Spike protein of SARS Cov 2 and human cellular receptors. Our results indicate that SARS CoV 2 uses a dual strategy: its spike protein could also interact with sialic acid receptors of the cells in the upper airways, in addition to the known interaction with Angiotensin converting enzyme 2.	1
2590	Coronavirus Disease 2019 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related coronaviruses (e.g., 2019 nCoV and SARS CoV) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019 nCoV and SARS CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID 19 and SARS related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID 19 and SARS related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019 nCoV and SARS CoV may be preadapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence future.	0
2591	"Background: Recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) outbreak started in Wuhan, China. Although the clinical features of have been reported previously, data regarding the risk factors associated with the clinical outcomes are lacking.
Objectives: To summary and analyze the clinical characteristics and identify the predictors of disease severity and mortality.
The PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Cochrane and MedRxiv databases were searched through February 25, 2020. Meta analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) recommendations were followed. We extracted and pooled data using random e ects meta analysis to summary the clinical feature of the confirmed COVID 19 patients, and further identify risk factors for disease severity and death. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I² method and explained with subgroup analysis and meta regression.
A total of 30 studies including 53000 patients with were included in this study, the mean age was 49.8 years (95% CI, 47.5 52.2 yrs) and 55.5% were male. The pooled incidence of severity and mortality were 20.2% (95% CI, 15.1 25.2%) and 3.1% (95% CI, 1.9 4.2%), respectively. The predictor for disease severity included old age (≥ 50 yrs, odds ratio [OR] = 2.61; 95% CI, 2.29 2.98), male (OR =1.348, 95% CI, 1.195 1.521), smoking (OR =1.734, 95% CI, All rights reserved.

In terms of laboratory results, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C reactive protein (CRP) and D dimer and decreased blood platelet and lymphocytes count were highly associated with severe COVID 19 (all for P < 0.001). Meanwhile, old age (≥ 60 yrs, RR = 9.45; 95% CI, 8.09 11.04), followed by cardiovascular disease (RR = 6.75; 95% CI, 5.40 8.43) hypertension (RR = 4.48; 95% CI, and diabetes (RR = 4.43; 95% CI, 3.49 5.61) were found to be independent prognostic factors for the COVID 19 related death.
To our knowledge, this is the first evidence based medicine research to explore the risk factors of prognosis in patients with COVID 19, which is helpful to identify early stage patients with poor prognosis and adapt effective treatment.

2593	The outbreak of coronavirus diseases has rabidly spread all over the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that coronavirus COVID 19 is an international pandemic. The Real Time Reverse transcription polymerase Chain Reaction (RT PCR) has a low positive and sensitivity rate in the early stage of COVID 19. As a result, the Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is used for diagnosing. COVID 19 has different key signs on a CT scan differ from other viral pneumonia. These signs include ground glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving. In this paper, an Artificial Intelligence inspired Model for COVID 19 Diagnosis and Prediction for Patient Response to Treatment (AIMDP) is proposed. AIMDP model has two main functions reflected in two proposed modules, namely, the Diagnosis Module (DM) and Prediction Module (PM). The Diagnosis Module (DM) is proposed for early and accurately detecting the patients with COVID 19 and distinguish it from other viral pneumonias using COVID 19 signs obtained from CT scans. The DM model, uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a Deep learning technique for segmentation, can process hundreds of CT images in seconds to speed up diagnosis of COVID 19 and contribute in its containment. In addition, some countries haven't the ability to provide all patients with the treatment and intensive care services, so it will be mandatory to give treatment to only responding patients. In this context, the Prediction Module (PM) is proposed for predicting the ability of the patient to respond to treatment based on different factors e.g. age, infection stage, respiratory failure, multi organ failure and the treatment regimens. PM implement the Whale Optimization Algorithm for selecting the most relevant patient's features. The experimental results show promising performance for the proposed diagnosing and prediction modules, using a dataset with hundreds of real data and CT images.	0
2594	COVID 19 has affected the world tremendously. It is critical that biological experiments and clinical designs are informed by computational approaches for time and cost effective solutions. Comparative analyses particularly can play a key role to reveal structural changes in proteins due to mutations, which can lead to behavioural changes, such as the increased binding of the SARS CoV 2 surface glycoprotein to human ACE2 receptors. The aim of this report is to provide an easy to follow tutorial for biologists and others without delving into different bioinformatics tools. More complex analyses such as the use of large scale computational methods can then be utilised. Starting with a SARS CoV 2 genome sequence, the report shows visualising DNA sequence features, deriving amino acid sequences, and aligning different genomes to analyse mutations and differences. The report provides further insights into how the SARS CoV 2 surface glycoprotein mutated for higher binding affinity to human ACE2 receptors, compared to the SARS CoV protein, by integrating existing 3D protein models.	0

Monocyte Macrophage Responses Cause Lethal Pneumonia in SARS CoV Infected Mice Graphical Abstract Highlights d SARS CoV causes a lethal respiratory infection in BALB/c mice d Robust SARS CoV replication and delayed IFN I signaling promote disease d IFN I induces influx of pathogenic inflammatory monocytes and vascular leakage d Disease severity is ameliorated in the absence of IFN signaling SUMMARY Highly pathogenic human respiratory coronaviruses cause acute lethal disease characterized by exuberant inflammatory responses and lung damage. However, the factors leading to lung pathology are not well understood. Using mice infected with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) CoV, we show that robust virus replication accompanied by delayed type I interferon (IFN I) signaling orchestrates inflammatory responses and lung immunopathology with diminished survival. IFN I remains detectable until after virus titers peak, but early IFN I administration ameliorates immunopathology. This delayed IFN I signaling promotes the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocytemacrophages (IMMs), resulting in elevated lung cytokine/chemokine levels, vascular leakage, and impaired virus specific T cell responses. Genetic ablation of the IFN ab receptor (IFNAR) or IMM depletion protects mice from lethal infection, without affecting viral load. These results demonstrate that IFN I and IMM promote lethal SARS CoV infection and identify IFN I and IMMs as potential therapeutic targets in patients infected with pathogenic coronavirus and perhaps other respiratory viruses."	0

2599	On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China. Subsequent investigations identified a novel coronavirus, now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2), from the affected patients. Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are important for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS CoV 2 associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) epidemic. In this study, we developed and compared the performance of three novel real time reverse transcription PCR (RT PCR) assays targeting the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS CoV 2 with that of the reported RdRp P2 assay, which is used in Ͼ30 European laboratories. Among the three novel assays, the COVID 19 RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro (1.8 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID 50 ]/ml with genomic RNA and 11.2 RNA copies/reaction with in vitro RNA transcripts). Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID 19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID 19 RdRp/Hel and RdRp P2 assays. The COVID 19 RdRp/Hel assay was positive for an additional 42 RdRp P2 negative specimens (119/ 273 [43.6%] versus 77/273 [28.2%]; P Ͻ 0.001), including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non respiratory tract specimens. The mean viral load of these specimens was 3.21 ϫ 10 4 RNA copies/ml (range, 2.21 ϫ 10 2 to 4.71 ϫ 10 5 RNA copies/ml). The COVID 19 RdRp/Hel assay did not cross react with other human pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens, whereas the RdRp P2 assay cross reacted with SARS CoV in cell culture. The highly sensitive and specific COVID 19 RdRp/Hel assay may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID 19.	0

Characterization of rotaviruses isolated from pigs with diarrhoea in Venezuela. Vet. Microbiol., 13: 35  45.
The prevalence of porcine rotavirus infection was studied in A5 different herds located in the north western region of Venezuela. The presence of rotavirus was studied by direct electron microscopy (EM) and by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). From 136 samples analyzed during the six months of the study (September 1983  February 1984), 38 (27.9%) were found to be positive for rotaviruses, with infection more common in animals that were 4  6 weeks old. Atypical rotaviruses were not detected in any of the samples examined. Most rotavirus positive specimens were subgrouped using specific monoclonal antibodies in an ELISA test. The majority of the samples (26 out of 38) were found to exhibit Subgroup I antigenicity. Only two specimens, collected from the same herd in two consecutive months, were found to belong to Subgroup II. To characterize further the circulating rotaviruses, electrophoretic analysis of the RNA genome was performed on samples selected from nine different herds. Great variability in the RNA electropherotypes was observed. No correlation was found between subgroup specificity and the migration of the two smaller segments (Genes 10 and 11), as has been described for human rotaviruses."	0
2602	Lack of evidence on SARS CoV 2 transmission dynamics has led to shifting isolation guidelines between airborne and droplet isolation precautions. During the initial isolation of 13 individuals confirmed positive with COVID 19 infection, air and surface samples were collected in eleven isolation rooms to examine viral shedding from isolated individuals. While all individuals were confirmed positive for SARS CoV 2, symptoms and viral shedding to the 15 environment varied considerably. Many commonly used items, toilet facilities, and air samples had evidence of viral contamination, indicating that SARS CoV 2 is shed to the environment as expired particles, during toileting, and through contact with fomites. Disease spread through both direct (droplet and person to person) as well as indirect contact (contaminated objects and airborne transmission) are indicated, supporting the use of airborne isolation precautions. 20	0
2603	"Decision making in medicine is informed by a subtle mixture of factors: education, experience, local protocols, gut feeling, avoiding litigation. The principle of audit is that one can influence practice also by reflecting back personal performance measured against standardised averages or formal guidance. Mitchell and colleagues highlight some of the challenges herein in their analysis of computed tomography in acute presentations with epilepsy. 1 They develop the findings of a recent national audit in the UK in selected cohorts of such patients which identified that as many as one in five patients with known epilepsy had scans following presentation to the emergency department. Many of you reading this are involved with such acute medicine presentations. They present a population level analysis over a 3 year period to identify patient factors associated with the rate of scanning. The potential of this to influence management algorithms and practice is discussed elegantly.
The theme of developing local policy by using national datasuch as the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)  is developed in the paper by Soong et al . 2 Frailty is a common condition with a potentially significant health impact among older adults. To date, it is not known whether stratifying by degrees of frailty can help plan care and result in improved outcomes. In a retrospective observational study, the authors report the predictive ability of routinely coded 'frailty syndromes' to predict long length of stay and mortality in a 1 year sample of patients over the age of 65. Frailty is of relevance to generalists, given the previous finding by the same group that the majority of hospital admission patients have at least one of these frailty syndromes.
Clinical Medicine is proudly a journal of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP), and is delighted to showcase topics that are of interest to the RCP. One of these is the need for NHS based tobacco addiction services, as highlighted in the RCP report Hiding in plain sight: Treating tobacco dependency in the NHS which called for a new model of care providing 'opt out' specialist services to treat the condition. 3 Evison and colleagues from Manchester report on the CURE project, the first UK service modelled on the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation. 4 A feature of the model is that secondary care clinicians are at the frontline in the delivery of treatment, of especial importance since the NHS 10 year plan commits to funding the treatment of Think national, act local: the role of the physician and the RCP tobacco addiction in hospitals. The CURE project provides a potential framework for national roll out of such services, and we are delighted to present the impact of the study in the first 6 months of service.
Another national, indeed global, health crisis  much more acute  is the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID 19) . The RCP, and its journals, are able to respond in nimble fashion with an update on the evolving outbreak, its clinical manifestations and the priorities for the immediate future.

2604	Pharmacists should be educated about travel medicine, since they could influence their own choices and those of the individuals they encounter. This study aims to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors towards infectious diseases related to travel among community pharmacists in Italy. The data was collected from September 2018 to September 2019 using semi structured telephone interviews. Only 1.8% answered correctly to all seven questions regarding the infectious diseases related to travel. Community pharmacists who had heard about travel medicine and those who had received information were more likely to have good knowledge. More than two thirds of the respondents believed that it is important to provide information to the public about travel medicine. Pharmacists who worked a higher number of hours per week, were more knowledgeable about the more frequent infectious diseases related to travel, believed that travel medicine was a pharmacist competency, believed that they could give advice to the public, and had received information from scientific journals and educational activities were more likely to have this positive attitude. More than two thirds often/always informed the public about the importance of having travel health center counseling. Pharmacists who had heard about travel medicine and those who believed that they could give advice to the public were more likely to inform. Interventions are needed to improve knowledge in order public.	0
2605	"Purpose: Community transmission of SARS CoV 2 was detected in Spain in February 2020, with 216% intensive care unit (ICU) capacity expanded in Vitoria by March 18 th , 2020.
We identified patients from the two public hospitals in Vitoria who were admitted to ICU with confirmed infection by SARS CoV 2. Data reported here were available in March 31th, 2020. Mortality was assessed in those who completed 7 days of ICU stay.
: We identified 48 patients (27 males) with confirmed SARS CoV 2. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of patients was 63 [51 75] years. Symptoms began a median of 7 [5 12] days before ICU admission. The most common comorbidities identified were obesity (n = 48%), arterial hypertension (n = 44%) and chronic lung disease (n = 37%). All patients were admitted by hypoxemic respiratory failure and none received non invasive mechanical ventilation. Forty five (94%) underwent intubation, 3 HFNT, 1 (2%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22 (49%) required prone position. After 15 days, 14/45 (31%) intubated patients died (13% within one week), 10 (22%) were extubated, and 21/45 (47%) underwent mechanical ventilation. Six patients had documented co infection. Procalcitonin plasma above 0.5 µg/L was associated with 16% vs. 19% (p = 0.78) risk of death after 7 days.
Conclusion: This early experience with SARS CoV 2 in Spain suggests that a strategy of right oxygenation avoiding non invasive mechanical ventilation was life saving. Seven day mortality in SARS CoV 2 requiring intubation was lower than 15%, with 80% of patients still requiring mechanical ventilation. After 15 days of ICU admission, half of patients remained intubated, whereas one third died."	0
2606	The SARS CoV 2 virus has resulted in a devastating pandemic of COVID 19. Exploring compounds that could offer a breakthrough in treatment is the need of the hour. Re positioning cheap, freely available and safe drugs is a priority. The paper proposes evidence for the potential use of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in the treatment of COVID 19. DEC has inhibitory effects on arachidonic acid metabolism to prostaglandins, little known anti viral effects on animal retroviruses and demonstrated anti inflammatory actions in animal models of lung inflammation indicating the need to explore this hypothesis further. being proposed to treat COVID 19.	1
2607	A proactive approach to raise awareness while preventing misinformation is a modern day challenge in all domains including healthcare. Such awareness and sensitization approaches to prevention and containment are important components of a strong healthcare system, especially in the times of outbreaks such as the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic. However, there is a fine balance between continuous awareness raising by providing new information and the risk of misinformation. In this work, we address this gap by creating a life long learning application that delivers authentic information to users in Hindi, the most widely used local language in India. It does this by matching sources of verified and authentic information such as the WHO reports against daily news by using machine learning and natural language processing. It delivers the narrated content in Hindi by using stateof the art text to speech engines. Finally, the approach allows user input for continuous improvement of news feed relevance on a daily basis. We demonstrate a focused application of this approach for Water, Sanitation, Hygiene as it is critical in the containment of the currently raging Covid 19 pandemic through the WashKaro android application. Thirteen combinations of pre processing strategies, word embeddings, and similarity metrics were evaluated by eight human users via calculation of agreement statistics. The best performing combination achieved a Cohen's Kappa of 0.54 and was deployed in the WashKaro application backend. Interventional studies for evaluating the effectiveness of the WashKaro application for preventing WASH related diseases are planned to be carried out in the Mohalla clinics that provided 3.5 Million consults in 2019 in Delhi, India. Additionally, the application also features human curated and vetted information to reach out to the community as audio visual content in local languages.	0

2611	"Background: The number of patients of COVID 19 in Tokyo has been increasing gradually through the end of March, 2020.
Object: Support for policymaking requires forecasting of the entire course and outcome of the outbreak including the date of collapse of medical facilities if a lockdown is not initiated. Moreover, the effects of a lockdown must be considered when choosing to initiate one.
Method: Data of Tokyo patients with symptoms during January 14  March 28, 2020 were used to formulate a susceptible infected recovered (SIR) model using three age classes and to estimate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ). Based on the estimated R 0 , We inferred outbreak outcomes including the date of collapse of medical facilities if a lockdown were not enacted. Then we estimate the lockdown effects.
Results: Results suggest R 0 as 2.86, with a 95% confidence interval of [2.73, 2.97]. Collapse of medical facilities can be expected to occur on April 26 if no lockdown occurs. The total number of deaths can be expected to be half a million people. If a lockdown were enacted from April 6, and if more than 60% of trips outside the home were restricted voluntarily, then a collapse of medical facilities could be avoided.
Discussion and Conclusion: The estimated R 0 was similar to that found from other studies conducted in China and Japan. Results demonstrate that a lockdown with reasonable cooperation of residents can avoid a collapse of medical facilities and save 0.25 million mortality cases.

2612	Background. The COVID 19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is straining health systems around the world. Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on people's movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS CoV 2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions. Methods. We employ molecular surveillance data of SARS CoV 2 epidemics for inference and comprehensive analysis of its global transmission network before the pandemic declaration. Our goal was to characterize the spatial temporal transmission pathways that led to the establishment of the pandemic. We exploited a network based approach specifically tailored to emerging outbreak settings. Specifically, it traces the accumulation of mutations in viral genomic variants via mutation trees, which are then used to infer transmission networks, revealing an up to date picture of the spread of SARS CoV 2 between and within countries and geographic regions. Results and Conclusions. The analysis suggest multiple introductions of SARS CoV 2 into the majority of world regions by means of heterogeneous transmission pathways. The transmission network is scale free, with a few genomic variants responsible for the majority of possible transmissions. The network structure is in line with the available temporal information represented by sample collection times and suggest the expected sampling time difference of few days between potential transmission pairs. The inferred network structural properties, transmission clusters and pathways and virus introduction routes emphasize the extent of the global epidemiological linkage and demonstrate the importance of internationally coordinated public health measures.	0

Los factores ambientales e infecciosos han sido fuertemente asociados al incremento de la ocurrencia de la enfermedad, hasta más del doble, en los últimos 10 años. En este artículo de revisión se describen los principales hallazgos reportados sobre la relación entre ciertas infecciones virales y bacterianas con la aparición y progresión de la EM.
Métodos: Se realizó un plan metodológico de búsqueda de artículos científicos relacionados con infección y EM, mediante la búsqueda de artículos científicos, principalmente publicados en inglés, en las plataformas virtuales de Pubmed, Medline y Cochrane. Para la búsqueda se utilizaron como palabras claves (términos MeSH): «virus, bacteria, autoimmune disease of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis». Se eligieron artículos publicados en revistas indexadas durante los últimos 15 años.
Resultados: Estudios epidemiológicos sugieren que la EM tiene un componente etiológico infeccioso que origina un proceso inflamatorio que puede contribuir a la iniciación o exacerbación de la enfermedad. Particularmente, la infección viral y los eventos de desmielinización en el SNC puede deberse a la penetración de un virus como el virus Epstein Barr (EBV), a través del torrente sanguíneo, específicamente hacia el SNC. Por otro lado, las infecciones bacterianas crónicas pueden causar procesos de desmielinización en el SNC que agravan la enfermedad de EM. * Autor para correspondencia.

Multiple sclerosis a b s t r a c t Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and the leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Environmental and infectious factors had been strongly associated and involved in the increased occurrence of MS, to more than twice, in the last 10 years. In this review, we describe the main findings on the relationship between viral and bacterial infections and the onset and progression of MS. Methods: The research involved a systematic review of scientific literature regarding infection and MS. Our search was performed using and consulting specialized websites like PubMed, Medline and Cochrane. The keywords (MeSH terms) employed for the digital search were: ""virus, bacteria, autoimmune disease of the nervous system, and multiple sclerosis."" Articles published in English indexed journals during the past 15 years were used for the study. Results: Epidemiological studies suggest that MS has an infectious etiologic component causing an inflammatory process that may contribute to the initiation and/or exacerbation of the disease. Particularly, viral infections and demyelination events in the CNS may be due to the penetration of viruses such as the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) through the bloodstream to the CNS, specifically. On the other hand, chronic bacterial infections may cause demyelination processes that trigger or increase the complications of the disease in MS. Conclusions: This study shows the multiple factors involved in the occurrence of MS. More epidemiological studies are necessary to support the relationship and involvement of viral and bacterial infections in the onset, development and severity of the disease."	0
2614	The COVID 19 pandemic has stressed healthcare care systems throughout the world. Understanding clinical progression of cases is a key public health priority that informs optimal resource allocation during an emergency. Using data from Shenzhen, China, where all cases were monitored in hospital and symptom profiles and clinical and lab results were available starting from early stages of clinical course, we characterized clinical progression of COVID 19 cases and determined important predictors for faster clinical progression to key clinical events and longer use of medical resources. Epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, clinical, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records. We found that those who progressed to the severe stage, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) progressed on average 9.5 days (95%CI 8.7,10.3), 11.0 days (95%CI 9.7,12.3), and 10.5 days (95%CI 8.2,13.3) after symptom onset, respectively. We estimated that patients who were admitted to ICUs remained there for an average of 34.4 days (95%CI 24.1,43.2) and the average time on a ventilator was 28.5 days (95%CI 20.0,39.1) among those requiring mechanical ventilation. The median length of hospital stay was 21.3 days (95%CI, 20.5, 22.2) for the mild or moderate cases who did not progress to the severe stage, but increased to 52.1 days (95%CI, 43.3, 59.5) for those who required ICU admission. Clear characterization of clinical progression informs planning for healthcare resource allocation during COVID 19 outbreaks and provides a basis that helps assess the effectiveness of new treatment and therapeutics.	1

2619	Circulating in China and 158 other countries and areas, the ongoing COVID 19 outbreak has caused devastating mortality and posed a great threat to public health. However, efforts to identify effectively supportive therapeutic drugs and treatments has been hampered by our limited understanding of host disease. To characterize the transcriptional signatures of host inflammatory response to SARS CoV 2 (HCoV 19) infection, we carried out transcriptome sequencing of the RNAs isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) specimens of COVID 19 patients. Our results reveal distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles to SARS CoV 2 infection in patients, and highlight the association between COVID 19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release such as CCL2/MCP 1, CXCL10/IP 10, CCL3/MIP 1A, and CCL4/MIP1B. Furthermore, SARS CoV 2 induced activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes may be the cause of patients' lymphopenia. The transcriptome dataset of COVID 19 patients would be a valuable resource for clinical guidance on anti inflammatory medication and understanding the molecular mechansims of host response.	1
2620	The Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine (JEET), throughout its 15 years of existence, has tried to provide a respected outlet for scientific knowledge concerning the inextricable links between human societies and nature, food, and health. Ethnobiology and ethnomedicine centred research has moved at the (partially artificial and fictitious) interface between nature and culture and has investigated human consumption of wild foods and wild animals, as well as the use of wild animals or their parts for medicinal and other purposes, along with the associated knowledge, skills, practices, and beliefs. Little attention has been paid, however, to the complex interplay of social and cultural reasons behind the increasing pressure on wildlife. The available literature suggest that there are two main drivers that enhance the necessary conditions for infectious diseases to cross the species barrier from wild animals to humans: (1) the encroachment of human activities (e.g., logging, mining, agricultural expansion) into wild areas and forests and consequent ecological disruptions; and, connected to the former, (2) the commodification of wild animals (and natural resources in general) and an expanding demand and market for wild meat and live wild animals, particularly in tropical and sub tropical areas. In particular, a crucial role may have been played by the bushmeat euphoria and attached elitist gastronomies and conspicuous consumption phenomena. The COVID 19 pandemic will likely require ethnobiologists to reschedule research agendas and to envision new epistemological trajectories aimed at more effectively mitigating the existence.	0
2621	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic poses a serious public health 33 risk. Analyzing the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS 34 CoV 2) from clinical samples is crucial for the understanding of viral spread and viral 35 evolution, as well as for vaccine development. Existing sample preparation methods for 36 viral genome sequencing are demanding on user technique and time, and thus not ideal 37 for time sensitive clinical samples; these methods are also not optimized for high 38 performance on viral genomes. We have developed MetagenomIc RNA EnRichment 39 VirAl sequencing (MINERVA), a facile, practical, and robust approach for metagenomic 40 and deep viral sequencing from clinical samples. This approach uses direct tagmentation 41 of RNA/DNA hybrids using Tn5 transposase to greatly simplify the sequencing library 42 construction process, while subsequent targeted enrichment can generate viral genomes 43 with high sensitivity, coverage, and depth. We demonstrate the utility of MINERVA on 44 pharyngeal, sputum and stool samples collected from COVID 19 patients, successfully 45 obtaining both whole metatranscriptomes and complete high depth high coverage SARS 46 CoV 2 genomes from these clinical samples, with high yield and robustness. MINERVA 47 is compatible with clinical nucleic extracts containing carrier RNA. With a shortened 48 hands on time from sample to virus enriched sequencing ready library, this rapid, 49 versatile, and clinic friendly approach will facilitate monitoring of viral genetic variations 50 during outbreaks, both current and future.	0

2623	Radiographic images offer an alternative method for the rapid screening and monitoring of Coronavirus Disease 2019 patients. This approach is limited by the shortage of radiology experts who can provide a timely interpretation of these images. Motivated by this challenge, our paper proposes a novel learning architecture, called Detail Oriented Capsule Networks (DECAPS), for the automatic diagnosis of COVID 19 from Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Our network combines the strength of Capsule Networks with several architecture improvements meant to boost classification accuracies. First, DECAPS uses an Inverted Dynamic Routing mechanism which increases model stability by preventing the passage of information from non descriptive regions. Second, DECAPS employs a Peekaboo training procedure which uses a two stage patch crop and drop strategy to encourage the network to generate activation maps for every target concept. The network then uses the activation maps to focus on regions of interest and combines both coarse and fine grained representations of the data. Finally, we use a data augmentation method based on conditional generative adversarial networks to deal with the issue of data scarcity. Our model achieves 84.3% precision, 91.5% recall, and 96.1% area under the ROC curve, significantly outperforming state of the art methods. We compare the performance of the DECAPS model with three experienced, well trained thoracic radiologists and show that the architecture significantly outperforms them. While further studies on larger datasets are required to confirm this finding, our results imply that architectures like DECAPS can be used to assist radiologists in the CT scan mediated diagnosis of COVID 19.	0

This paper shows how the model was calibrated and applied to perform predictions of people needing to be hospitalized, needs of ventilators, or the number of deaths which would be produced. It is shown specifically the results obtained in the case of Spain, showing a prediction of diagnosed infected and deaths which will be observed after the ease of the total lockdown produced the 13 th of March. Is also shown how this model can provide an insight of what the level of infection in the different regions of Spain is forecasted. The model predicts for Spain for the end of May more than 400,000 diagnosed infected cases, number which will be probably higher due to the change in the possibilities of performing massive number of tests to the general population. The number of forecasted deaths for that date is 46,000± 15,000. The model also predicts the level of infection at the different Spanish regions, providing a counterintuitive result in the cases of Madrid and Catalonia as the result shows a higher the level of infection at Catalonia than the level at Madrid, according with this model.
All of these results can be used to guide policy makers in order to optimize resources and to avoid future outbreaks of the covid 19."	0

2629	The novel SARS CoV 2 virus has very high infectivity, which allows it to spread rapidly around the world. Attempts at slowing the pandemic at this stage depend on the number and quality of diagnostic tests performed. We propose that the olfactory epithelium from the nasal cavity may be a more appropriate tissue for detection of SARS CoV 2 virus at the earliest stages, prior to onset of symptoms or even in asymptomatic people, as compared to commonly used sputum or nasopharyngeal swabs. Here we emphasize that the nasal cavity olfactory epithelium is the likely site of enhanced binding of SARS CoV 2. Multiple non neuronal cell types present in the olfactory epithelium express two host receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteases, that facilitate SARS CoV 2 binding, replication, and accumulation. This may be the underlying mechanism for the recently reported cases of smell dysfunction in patients with COVID 19. Moreover, the possibility of subsequent brain infection should be considered which begins in olfactory neurons. In addition, we discuss the possibility that olfactory receptor neurons may initiate rapid immune responses at early stages of the disease. We emphasize the need to undertake research focused on additional aspects of SARS pathway.	0

2631	The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus infections from the epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural history of the recently emerged virus. Using publicly available event date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID 19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2 14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3 4 days without truncation and at 5 9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID 19 case fatality risk.	0

However, a number of clinical practice results showed that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays significant role in the treatment of COVID 19, bringing new hope for the prevention and control of COVID 19.
TCM has a long history and played an indispensable role in the prevention and treatment of several epidemic diseases. During the SARS epidemic in 2003, the intervention of TCM has also achieved remarkable therapeutic effect. During the treatment period of COVID 19, more than 3100 medical staff of TCM were dispatched to Hubei province, and TCM scheme was included in the guideline on diagnosis and treatment of COVID 19 [2], and TCM experts fully participate in the whole rescue process. The decoction, Chinese patent medicine, acupuncture and other characteristic therapy of TCM was comprehensively employed, mainly treated based on syndrome differentiation. Specific TCM wards were set up, and established the designated hospital, moreover, TCM team participates in treatment collectively. Currently, the total number of confirmed cases treated by TCM has reached 60,107 [3] . In 102 cases of mild symptoms treated with TCM, the clinical symptom disappearance time was shortened by 2 days, the recovery time of body temperature was shortened by 1.7 days, the average length of stay in hospital was shortened by 2.2 days, the improvement rate of CT image was increased by 22 %, the clinical cure rate was increased by 33 %, 27.4 % reduction in the rate of common to severe cases and 70 % increase in lymphocyte. 3 In addition, in the treatment of severe patients with TCM, the average length of stay in hospital and the time of nucleic acid turning negative has been shortened by more than 2 days.
From current treatment results, TCM based on an over all symptoms of 2019 nCoV pneumonia patients, has suggested to prescribe prescription that are likely to be effective, such as qingfei paidu decoction (QPD), gancaoganjiang decoction, sheganmahuang decoction, qingfei touxie fuzheng recipe, etc. QPD which consisted"	0

2640	"SARS CoV 2 is a zoonotic virus that has caused a pandemic of severe respiratory disease COVID 19within several months of its initial identification. Comparable to the first SARS CoV, this novel coronavirus's surface Spike (S) glycoprotein mediates cell entry via the human ACE 2 receptor, and, thus, is the principal target for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Molecular information on the SARS CoV 2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS CoV 2 S receptor binding domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 Å. We identified a set of SARS reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross reactivity to SARS CoV 2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ACE 2 binding site on the SARS CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS CoV 2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the ""closed"" prefusion S structure, but is accessible in ""open"" conformations. This first ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS CoV 2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS CoV 2 and related betacoronaviruses. : bioRxiv preprint

Recently, the molecular structure of recombinant full length SARS CoV 2 Spike protein was solved in a stabilized pre fusion state, by single particle cryo Electron Microscopy (cryo EM), at a resolution of 3.8 Å (Wrapp et al., 2020) . Despite the comprehensive structural characterization of the spike protein as a whole, movement of the RBD between ""up"" and ""down"" conformational states prevented complete modeling of the RBD domains. Subsequent cryo EM investigations of SARS CoV 2 provided more detail of RBD, particularly at sites that contact the human ACE 2 receptor (Yan et al., 2020a) . Here, we report the first high resolution less than 2 Å SARS CoV 2 RBD. Additionally, we present the antigenicity of this recombinant RBD, particularly of interest, given the equipoise in the literature regarding the binding affinities of SARS CoV antibodies for SARS CoV 2 RBD. Early reports, have described that the human SARS CoV antibody, CR3022, is able to bind to the SARS CoV 2 RBD. In the present study, we verify binding, and subsequently solved the structure of SARS CoV 2 RBD in complex with CR3022 with a novel ""cryptic"" epitope.

2641	"This study aims to explore the impact of healthcare digitalization on smart hospital project financing (PF) fostered by pay for performance (P4P) incentives. Digital platforms are a technology enabled business model that facilitates exchanges between interacting agents. They represent a bridging link among disconnected nodes, improving the scalable value of networks. Application to healthcare public private partnerships (PPPs) is significant due to the consistency of digital platforms with health issues and the complexity of the stakeholder's interaction. In infrastructural PPPs, public and private players cooperate, usually following PF patterns. This relationship is complemented by digitized supply chains and is increasingly patient centric. This paper reviews the literature, analyzes some supply chain bottlenecks, addresses solutions concerning the networking effects of platforms to improve PPP interactions, and investigates the cost benefit analysis of digital health with an empirical case. Whereas diagnostic or infrastructural technology is an expensive investment with long term payback, leapfrogging digital applications reduce contingent costs. ""Digital"" savings can be shared by key stakeholders with P4P schemes, incentivizing value co creation patterns. Efficient sharing may apply network theory to a comprehensive PPP ecosystem where stakeholding nodes are digitally connected. This innovative approach improves stakeholder relationships, which are re engineered around digital platforms that enhance patient centered satisfaction and sustainability. Digital technologies are useful even for infectious disease surveillance, like that of the coronavirus pandemic, for supporting massive healthcare intervention, decongesting hospitals, and providing timely big data. not due to population aging per se, but to the increase in demand for new medical technologies that improve and/or extend life as real per capita incomes grow [3, 4] .
Within this evolving framework, technology is a double edged sword, since it increases healthcare expenditure [5] but can also bring savings and quality of life improvements [6] . The relationship between medical technology and spending is complex and often conflicting. The impact of technology on costs differs across technologies, in that some (e.g., cancer drugs, invasive medical devices) have significant financial implications, while others are cost neutral or cost saving [7] . Medicine in the 21 st century is increasingly dependent on technology. Unlike in many other areas, the cost of medical technology is not declining, and its increasing use contributes to spiraling healthcare costs. Many medical professionals equate progress in medicine to the growing use of sophisticated technology, which is often expensive and beyond the reach of the average citizen [8] .
Whereas technology concerning tangible items, such as diagnostic equipment or physical infrastructure, has an uncertain cost benefit trade off, digital investments have a shorter payback, are typically cheaper, and show sounder benefits relative to their costs. Digital healthcare is a major driver of innovation, growth, and competitiveness. Digital technology is reported to reduce healthcare costs by 7 to 11 percent [9,10]. Cashless (digital) payment savings account for 0.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) [11] . To the extent that GDP can roughly be assimilated to revenue, and considering an incidence of some 80% of operating costs (EBIT/revenues), the estimated operating cost reduction due to cashless payments is around 0.4%. An international comparison of health prices across countries can improve the private competition for international public private partnership (PPP) tenders [12] .
Further savings may be envisaged due to the synergistic interaction of intangibles (e.g., big data and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). These bundled resources feed interoperable cloud databases linked to digital platforms [13] with information secured by blockchains and interpreted with artificial intelligence algorithms [14] ). Digital investments actively interact with physical technologies (e.g., for the eHealth transmission of scans or lab exams) and contribute to increasing their added value.
Digital investments in infrastructural healthcare projects are often undertaken with PPPs, where the public player sets the goals and necessities, whereas the private actor (backed by its sponsoring banks) provides the technological expertise and takes on most of the investment's risk. Eurostat's definition of a PPP requires that a government entity is the direct source of most of the revenues that the partner is entitled to receive under the contract. This is the case if the demand for or use of the asset originates from the government entity itself (e.g., a hospital paid for by a government entity on an availability basis) [15] .
Smart hospitals represent the latest frontier of healthcare impact investments. Technological features are so advanced that public authorities hardly possess the know how to conceive, build, and operate them [16] . Many public bureaucrats are also technophobic. The increasing pace of change in healthcare technologies and policies has generated increased interest in the future adaptability of the physical infrastructure that supports health services [17] . Technological investments are often made possible by public private cooperation within healthcare PPP agreements backed by project finance (PF) patterns. The introduction of health information technologies (HIT) increases organizational performance, including productivity enhancement and cost reductions. HIT can contribute to hospital profitability, for instance, by reducing paper chart pulling and document transportation, reducing medical errors, and potentially lowering medical liability costs as well as decreasing back office expenses [18, 19] . These technological advances hence contribute to making the model sustainable and profitable for all the stakeholders.
Consistent with this evolving framework, this paper will concentrate on some key aspects that concern the digital impact on infrastructural healthcare investments that face increasing public budget pressures. As it will be shown in the methodological section, the study focuses on the estimation of the potential digital savings accruing to the private player. These savings must then be shared with the public player (to avoid undeserved private rents) and returned, as far as possible, to the patients, in the form of lower fees and improved care. Part of the saving should also be reinvested in"	0

2643	There is an ongoing worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). At present, confirmatory diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR), typically taking several hours and requiring a molecular laboratory to perform. There is an urgent need for rapid, simplified and cost effective detection methods. We have developed and analytically validated a protocol for direct rapid extraction free PCR (DIRECT PCR) detection of SARS CoV 2 without the need for nucleic acid purification. As few as 6 RNA copies per reaction of viral nucleocapsid (N) gene from respiratory samples such as sputum and nasal exudate can be detected directly using our one step inhibitor resistant assay. The performance of this assay was validated on a commercially available portable PCR thermocycler. Viral lysis, reverse transcription, amplification and detection are achieved in a single tube homogeneous reaction within 36 minutes. This minimized hands on time, reduces turnaround time for sample to result and obviates the need for RNA purification reagents. It could enable wider use of Covid 19 testing for diagnosis, screening and research in countries and regions where laboratory capabilities are limiting.	0

2649	With the recent COVID 19 pandemic, healthcare systems all over the world are struggling to manage the massive increase in emergency department (ED) visits. This has put an enormous demand on medical professionals. Increased wait times in the ED increases the risk of infection transmission. In this work we present an open source, low cost, off body system to assist in the automatic triage of patients in the ED based on widely available hardware. The system initially focuses on two symptoms of the infection  fever and cyanosis. The use of visible and far infrared cameras allows for rapid assessment at a 1m distance, thus reducing the load on medical staff and lowering the risk of spreading the infection within hospitals. Its utility can be extended to a general clinical setting in non emergency times as well to reduce wait time, channel the time and effort of healthcare professionals to more critical tasks in particular, which are just beginning to be affected by COVID 19.	0

In this study, we firstly verified that 17 SARS CoV 2 uses human ACE2 as a cell receptor and its spike (S) protein mediates high 18 membrane fusion activity. Comparing to that of SARS CoV, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) 19 sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS CoV 2 possesses markedly increased α helicity 20 and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 21 (HR1) site. Then, we designed a HR2 sequence based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed 22 IPB02, which showed highly poent activities in inibibiting the SARS CoV 2 S 23 protein mediated cell cell fusion and pseudovirus infection. IPB02 also inhibited the 24 SARS CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the strcuture and activity relationship (SAR) 25 of IPB02 were characterzized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid 26 motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities. Therefore, the presented results have 27 provided important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS CoV 2 and the 28 design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step.

2654	"Significant aspects of COVID 19 pandemic remain obscure. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS CoV 2, the causative agent of COVID 19. We strongly encourage the concept that thorough considerations of receptorligand interactions should be kept at the heart of scientific debate on infection. In this idea, the whole renin angiotensin system has to be evaluated. We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak. We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation. This hypothesis paper is an urgent call for the development of research programs that aim at questioning whether the putative protagonists of this tragedy are real life actors in COVID 19.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID 19 outbreak, originally started in China, a global pandemic. Since then, the outbreak has indeed spread across all continents, threatening the public health of numerous countries. Although the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of COVID 19 is relatively low when optimal level of healthcare is granted to the patients, the high percentage of severe cases developing severe pneumonia and thus requiring respiratory support is worryingly high, and could lead to a rapid saturation of Intensive Care Units (ICUs). To overcome this risk, most countries enacted COVID 19 containment measures. In this study, we use a Bayesian SEIR epidemiological model to perform a parametric regression over the COVID 19 outbreaks data in China, Italy, Belgium, and Spain, and estimate the effect of the containment measures on the basic reproduction ratio R 0 . We find that the effect of these measures is detectable, but tends to be gradual, and that a progressive strengthening of these measures usually reduces the R 0 below 1, granting a decay of the outbreak. We also discuss the biases and inconsistencies present in the publicly available data on COVID 19 cases, providing an estimate for the actual number of cases in Italy on March 12, 2020. Lastly, despite the data and model's limitations, we argue that the idea of ""flattening the curve"" to reach herd immunity is likely to be unfeasible.

2656	"Objectives: It is unclear whether patients with hypertension are more likely to be infected with SARS COV 2 than the general population and whether there is a difference in the severity of COVID 19 pneumonia in patients who have taken ACEI/ARB drugs to lower blood pressure compared to those who have not.
Methods: This observational study included data from all patients with clinically confirmed COVID 19 who were admitted to the Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China between January 5 and March 8, 2020. Data were extracted from clinical and laboratory records.
Follow up was cutoff on March 8, 2020.
Results: A total of 274 patients, 75 with hypertension and 199 without hypertension, were included in the analysis. Patients with hypertension were older and were more likely to have pre existing comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease than patients without hypertension. Moreover, patients with hypertension tended to have higher positive COVID 19 PCR detection rates.
Patients with hypertension who had previously taken ACEI/ARB drugs for antihypertensive treatment have an increased tendency to develop severe pneumonia after infection with SARS COV 2 (P = 0.064).
Conclusions: COVID 19 patients with hypertension were significantly older and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease.

2659	The emergence of the betacoronavirus, SARS CoV 2 that causes COVID 19, represents a significant threat to global human health. Vaccine development is focused on the principal target of the humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, that mediates cell entry and membrane fusion. SARS CoV 2 S gene encodes 22 N linked glycan sequons per protomer, which likely play a role in immune evasion and occluding immunogenic protein epitopes. Here, using a site specific mass spectrometric approach, we reveal the glycan structures on a recombinant SARS CoV 2 S immunogen. This analysis enables mapping of the glycanprocessing states across the trimeric viral spike. We show how SARS CoV 2 S glycans differ from typical host glycan processing, which may have implications in viral pathobiology and vaccine design.	1

2662	"Objectives : Coronavirus disease 19 has spread rapidly around the world, and many risk factors including patient demographics, social determinants of health, environmental variables, underlying health conditions, and adherence to social distancing have been hypothesized to affect case and death rates. However, little has been done to account for the potential confounding effects of these factors. Using a large multivariate analysis, this study illuminates modulators of COVID 19 incidence and mortality in U.S. counties while controlling for risk factors across multiple domains.
Methods : Data on COVID 19 and various risk factors in all U.S. counties was collected from publicly available data sources through April 14, 2020. Counties with at least 50 COVID 19 cases were included in case analyses and those with at least 10 deaths were included in mortality models. The 661 counties meeting inclusion criteria for number of cases were grouped into quartiles and comparisons of risk factors were made using t tests between the highest and lowest quartiles. Similar comparisons for 217 counties were made for above average and below average deaths/100,000. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of factors that significantly impacted cases and deaths.
Results : Univariate analyses demonstrated numerous significant differences between cohorts for both cases and deaths. Risk factors associated with increased cases and/or deaths per 100,000 included increased GDP per capita, decreased social distancing, increased age, increased percent Black, decreased percent Hispanic, decreased percent Asian, decreased health, increased poverty, increased diabetes, increased coronary heart disease, increased physical inactivity, increased alcohol consumption, increased tobacco use, and decreased access to primary care. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for worse COVID 19 outcome independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other mitigating factors. Lower daily temperatures was also an independent risk factor in case load but not deaths.
Conclusions : U.S. counties with a higher proportion of Black residents are associated with increased COVID 19 cases and deaths. However, the various suggested mechanisms, such as socioeconomic and healthcare predispositions, did not appear to drive the effect of race in our model. Counties with higher average daily temperatures are also associated with decreased COVID 19 cases but not deaths. Several theories are posited to explain these findings, including prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Additional studies are needed to further understand these effects."	0

2665	Testing for COVID 19 has been unable to keep up with the demand. Further, the false negative rate is projected to be as high as 30% and test results can take some time to obtain. X ray machines are widely available and provide images for diagnosis quickly. This paper explores how useful chest X ray images can be in diagnosing COVID 19 disease. We have obtained 135 chest X rays of COVID 19 and 320 chest X rays of viral and bacterial pneumonia. A pre trained deep convolutional neural network, Resnet50 was tuned on 102 COVID 19 cases and 102 other pneumonia cases in a 10 fold cross validation. The results were an overall accuracy of 90.7% with a COVID 19 true positive rate of 0.83 and an AUC of 0.987, Pre trained Resnet50 and VGG16 plus our own small CNN were tuned or trained on a balanced set of COVID 19 and pneumonia chest X rays. An ensemble of the three types of CNN classifiers was applied to a test set of 33 unseen COVID 19 and 208 pneumonia cases. The overall accuracy was 94.4% with the true positive rate for COVID 19 of 0.969 with 6% false positives for a true negative rate of 0.94 and AUC of 0.99. This preliminary study has flaws, most critically a lack of information about where in the disease process the COVID 19 cases were and the small data set size. More COVID 19 case images at good resolution will enable a better answer to the question of how useful chest X rays can be for diagnosing Note an earlier version of this work inadvertently used chest X rays of viral and bacterial pneumonia that came from a dataset of children under 5 years old and those results should be ignored.	0

2667	We present a stochastic compartmental network model of SARS CoV 2 and COVID 19 exploring the e↵ects of policy choices in three domains: social distancing, hospital triaging, and testing. We distinguished between high risk and low risk members of the population, and modeled di↵erences in social interactions due to context, risk level, infection status, and testing status. The model incorporates many of the currently important characteristics of the disease, including overcapacity in the healthcare system and uncertainties surrounding the proportion and transmission potential of asymptomatic cases. We compared current policy guidelines from public health agencies with alternative options, and investigated the e↵ects of policy decisions on the overall proportion of COVID 19 related deaths. Our results support current policies to contain the outbreak but also suggest possible refinements, including emphasizing the need to reduce public, random contacts more than private contacts, and testing low risk symptomatic individuals before high risk symptomatic individuals. Our model furthermore points to interactions among the three policy domains; the e cacy of a particular policy choice depends on other implemented policies. Finally, our results provide an explanation for why societies like Germany, with lower average rates of social contact, are more successful at containing the outbreak than highly measures.	0

We downloaded the genomes of 2019 nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019 nCoVs.
Results: An isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019 nCoVs.

2677	Importance: A surge in severe cases of COVID 19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in children would present unique challenges for hospitals and public health preparedness efforts in the United States. Objective: To provide evidence based estimates of children infected with SARS CoV 2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and projected cumulative numbers of severely ill pediatric COVID 19 cases requiring hospitalization during the US 2020 pandemic. Design: Empirical case projection study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Adjusted pediatric severity proportions and adjusted pediatric criticality proportions were derived from clinical and spatiotemporal modeling studies of the COVID 19 epidemic in China for the period January February 2020. Estimates of total children infected with SARS CoV 2 in the United States through April 6, 2020, were calculated using US pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) cases and the adjusted pediatric criticality proportion. Projected numbers of severely and critically ill children with COVID 19 were derived by applying the adjusted severity and criticality proportions to US population data, under several scenarios of cumulative pediatric infection proportion (CPIP). Results: By April 6, 2020, there were 74 children who had been reported admitted to PICUs in 19 states, reflecting an estimated 176 190 children nationwide infected with SARS CoV 2 (52 381 infants and toddlers younger than 2 years, 42 857 children aged 2 11 years, and 80 952 children aged 12 17 years). Under a CPIP scenario of 5%, there would be 3.7 million children infected with SARS CoV 2, 9907 severely ill children requiring hospitalization, and 1086 critically ill children requiring PICU admission. Under a CPIP scenario of 50%, 10 865 children would require PICU admission, 99 073 would require hospitalization for severe pneumonia, and 37.0 million would be infected with SARS CoV 2. Conclusions and Relevance: Because there are 74.0 million children 0 to 17 years old in the United States, the projected numbers of severe cases could overextend available pediatric hospital care resources under several moderate CPIP scenarios for 2020 despite lower severity of COVID 19 in children than in adults.	0
2678	The emergence and rapid worldwide spread of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID 19, has prompted concerted efforts to find successful treatments. The causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2), uses its spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells. Therefore, the S protein presents a viable target to develop a directed therapy. Here, we deployed an integrated artificial intelligence with molecular dynamics simulation approach to provide new details of the S protein structure. Based on a comprehensive structural analysis of S proteins from SARS CoV 2 and previous human coronaviruses, we found that the protomer state of S proteins is structurally flexible. Without the presence of a stabilizing beta sheet from another protomer chain, two regions in the S2 domain and the hinge connecting the S1 and S2 subunits lose their secondary structures. Interestingly, the region in the S2 domain was previously identified as an immunodominant site in the SARS CoV 1 S protein. We anticipate that the molecular details elucidated here will assist in effective therapeutic development for COVID 19.	1

Abstract 28 Approximately 15 20% of COVID 19 patients will develop severe 29 pneumonia, about 10 % of which will die if not properly managed. Earlier 30 discrimination of the potential severe patients basing on routine clinical and 31 laboratory changes and commencement of prophylactical management will not 32 only save their lives but also mitigate the otherwise overwhelmed health care 33 burden. In this retrospective investigation, the clinical and laboratory features 34 were collected from 125 COVID 19 patients, who were classified into mild (93 35 cases) or severe (32 cases) groups according to their clinical outcomes after 3 36 to 7 days post admission. The subsequent analysis with single factor and 37 multivariate logistic regression methods indicated that 17 factors on admission 38 differed significantly between mild and severe groups, but that only comorbid 39 with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (>24/min), elevated C 40 reactive protein (CRP >10mg/liter), and lactate dehydrogenase 41 (LDH >250U/liter), were independently associated with the later disease 42 development. Finally, we evaluated their prognostic values with the receiver 43 operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and found that the above four 44 factors could not confidently predict the occurrence of severe pneumonia 45 individually, but that a combination of fast respiratory rate and elevated LDH 46 significantly increased the predictive confidence (AUC= 0.944, sensitivity= 47 329 Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia	0

2684	The emergent global pandemic caused by the rapid spread of Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has led to increased mortality and negatively impacted day to day activities of humankind within a short period of time. As the data is rapidly emerging from earlier outbreak locations around the world, there are efforts to assimilate this with the knowledge from prior epidemics and find rapid solutions for this. One of the observations and a recurring theme is the disproportionate differences in the incidence of infection and the consequent mortality between males and females. We, therefore, analyzed retrospective datasets from the previous epidemics and the ongoing pandemic in order to address these differences in clinical outcomes. The data shows that even though the infection rates are similar, the odds ratio of male mortality remains high, indicating a divergence in the crosstalk between the three pathogenic human Coronavirus (hCoVs) the SARS CoV, MERS CoV and the SARS CoV 2 and immune effectors in the two sexes. One proximate cause is the sex specific modulation of the X linked genes that can influence susceptibility to infection. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings, which can form the basis pandemics.	0
2685	"The SARS CoV 2 coronavirus is wreaking havoc globally, yet knowledge of its biology is limited.
Climate and seasonality influence the distributions of many diseases, and studies suggest a link between SARS CoV 2 and cool weather. One such study, building species distribution models (SDMs), predicted SARS CoV 2 risk may remain concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, shifting northward in summer months. Others have highlighted issues with SARS CoV 2 SDMs, notably: the primary niche of the virus is the host it infects, climate may be a weak distributional predictor, global prevalence data have issues, and the virus is not in a population equilibrium.
While these issues should be considered, climate still may be important for predicting the future distribution of SARS CoV 2. To further examine if there is a link, we model with raw cases and population scaled cases for SARS CoV 2 county level data from the United States. We show that SDMs built from population scaled cases data cannot be distinguished from control models built from raw human population data, while SDMs built on raw data fail to predict the current known distribution of cases in the US. The population scaled analyses indicate that climate may not play a central role in current US viral distribution and that human population density is likely a primary driver. Still, we do find slightly more population scaled viral cases in cooler areas. This coupled with our geographically constrained focus make it so we cannot rule out climate as a partial driver of the US SARS CoV 2 distribution. Climate's role on SARS CoV 2 should continue to be cautiously examined, but at this time we should assume that SARS CoV 2 can spread anywhere in the US."	0
2686	Infectious diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with viruses and bacteria in particular having enormous impacts on global healthcare. One major challenge in combatting such diseases is a lack of effective drugs or specific treatments. In addition, drug resistance to currently available therapeutics and adverse effects caused by long term overuse are both serious public health issues. A promising treatment strategy is to employ cell membrane mimics as decoys to trap and to detain the pathogens. In this Perspective, we briefly review the infection mechanisms adopted by different pathogens at the cellular membrane interface and highlight the applications of cell membranemimicking nanodecoys for systemic protection against infectious diseases. We also discuss the implication of nanodecoy−pathogen complexes in the development of vaccines. We anticipate this Perspective will provide new insights on design and development	1
2687	"One of the many unresolved questions that revolves around the Covid 19 pandemic is whether local outbreaks can depend on ambient conditions like temperature and relative humidity. In this paper, we develop a model that tries to explain and describe the temperature and relative humidity sensitivity of respiratory droplets and their possible connection in determining viral outbreaks. The model has two parts. First, we model the growth rate of the infected population based on a reaction mechanism  the final equations of which are similar to the well known SIR model. The advantage of modeling the pandemic using the reaction mechanism is that the rate constants have sound physical interpretation. The infection rate constant is derived using collision rate * theory and shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime. In the second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for disease transmission as salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation time accounting for droplet cooling, heat and mass transfer and finally crystallization of the salt. The model output favourably compares with the experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of pure water and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model. Droplet evaporation/desiccation time is indeed dependent on ambient temperature and relative humidity, considered at both outdoor and indoor conditions.
Since the droplet evaporation time determines the infection rate constant, ambient temperature and relative humidity are shown to impact the outbreak growth rates."	0
2688	In December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, this highly contagious COVID 19 has been spreading worldwide, with a rapid rise in the number of deaths. Novel COVID 19 infected pneumonia (NCIP) is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. A variety of chest imaging features have been reported, similar to those found in other types of coronavirus syndromes. The purpose of the present review is to briefly discuss the known epidemiology and the imaging findings of coronavirus syndromes, with a focus on the reported imaging findings of NCIP. Moreover, the authors review precautions and safety Implementation of a robust plan in the radiology department is required to prevent further transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members.	1

2690	"We comparatively analyzed the spatiotemporal fluctuations of the 2019 novel coronavirus and SARS outbreaks to understand their epidemiological characteristics.
Methodologically, we introduced TPL (Taylor's power law) to characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability and Hubbell's (2001) unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) [specifically Harris et al. (2015) HDP MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process multi site neutral)] to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL b) slightly exceeding 2 for cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections, suggesting their potentially 'chaotic', unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter (M 0 ) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds (COVID 19/SARS), time (disease stages), space (regions) and public health interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M 0 measures the infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M 0 coincides or below the level of Allee effects. For example, M 0 =5.758 (COVID 19, China, or 196=M 0 x34 in total) vs. M 0 =2.701 (COVID 19, World) vs. M 0 =9.475 (SARS, World) suggested
that the potentially 'stabilized' infection level of COVID 19 in China is nearly ½ lower than that of SARS worldwide, but twice higher than that of COVID 19 worldwide. This may indicate that COVID 19 outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters θ and M, borrowed from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative 2 significance of ""infection through local contagion"" vs. ""infection through migration"", both of which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public health interventions. Third, comparing the levels of TPL M 0 and θ may leverage the complementary nature of TPL analysis and metapopulation modeling. For example, their difference (θ M 0 =0.6) for the COVID 19 in China confirmed the critical importance of controlling migration (mobility) in suppressing the outbreak, although migration may have been a primary driving force for the initial outbreaks in several regions of China."	0

A novel influenza virus created the first pandemic of the 21st century, the pandemic flu in 2009 preceded with the emergence of another deadly virus, MERS CoV in 2012. A novel coronavirus ""SARS CoV 2"" (and the disease COVID 19) emerged suddenly, causing a rapid outbreak with a moderate case fatality rate. This virus is continuing to cause health care providers grave concern due to the lack of any existing immunity in the human population, indicating their novelty and lack of previous exposure. The big question is whether this novel virus will be establishing itself in an endemic form or will it eventually die out?

There is no evidence on the short and longer term psychological impacts of restrictive practices or social and personal constraints for childbearing women during COVID 19 in particular, or infection pandemics in general. The potential for adverse mental health consequences of the pandemic should be recognised as a critical public health concern, together with appropriate care and support to prevent and ameliorate any negative impacts.	1

The COVID 19 pandemic has quickly and radically altered how Otolaryngologists provide patient care in the outpatient setting. Continuity of care with established patients as well as establishment of a professional relationship with new patients is challenging during this Public Health Emergency (PHE). Many geographic areas are under ""stay at home"" or ""shelter in place"" directives from state and local governments to avoid COVID 19 exposure risks. Medicare has recently allowed ""broad flexibilities to furnish services using remote communications technology to avoid exposure risks to health care providers, patients, and the community."" 1 The implementation of telemedicine, or virtual, services, will help the Otolaryngologists provide needed care to patients while mitigating the clinical and financial impact of the pandemic. The significant coding and billing issues related to implementing telemedicine services are discussed to promote acceptance of this technology by the practicing Otolaryngologist. Of particular importance, outpatient visit Current Procedural Terminology® codes (99201 99215) may be used for telehealth visits performed in real time audio and video.
Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f Medicare is a major payor in most Otolaryngology practices and many non Medicare payors follow Medicare policies. We hope that Otolaryngologists will embrace this technology currently, as well as for the future, to foster and maintain essential patient care in the office setting. Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 4
Many people use the terms ""telehealth"" and ""telemedicine"" interchangeably, but the definitions are not the same. Telehealth is a broad term that includes telemedicine as one type of service.
The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), of the DHHS, defines telehealth as ""the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support and promote long distance clinical health care, patient and professional healthrelated education, public health and health administration."" 2
The HRSA goes on to say: ""Telehealth is different from telemedicine because it refers to a broader scope of remote healthcare services than telemedicine. While telemedicine refers specifically to remote clinical services, telehealth can refer to remote non clinical services, such as provider training, administrative meetings, and continuing medical education, in addition to clinical services."" 3 CMS refers to many remote clinical services at ""telehealth visits"" as opposed to calling them ""telemedicine services"". For purposes of this Commentary, we use the term ""virtual services"" to encompass four types of billable services: 1) telehealth services (Medicare""s term) and telemedicine services, 2) telephone services (calls),
Effective for services retroactive to March 1, 2020, and for the duration of the COVID 19 PHE, Medicare will make payment for virtual services furnished to patients in broader circumstances and with relaxed requirements. 4 Table 1 illustrates variations in key guidelines for Medicare""s telehealth services guidelines prior to, and during, the PHE. Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 6 Modality/Platform Considerations CMS continues to require an interactive real time audio and video telecommunication system for Evaluation and Management (E/M) telehealth visits 99201 99215. A telephone call, without the real time video component, does not meet the requirements for billing telehealth visit codes, 99201 99215, to Medicare. Refer to the section on telephone calls below for more information on audio without video services. CMS has relaxed the rules requiring a HIPAA secured platform and now allows non HIPAA secure applications for video chats, including Apple FaceTime, Zoom, Doxy.me, Facebook Messenger video chat, Google Hangouts video, Skype, etc. Applications that are ""public facing"" and not allowed include Facebook Live, Twitch, and TikTok.
Practices must notify patients that any third party application potentially introduces privacy risks.
Prior to the PHE, Medicare paid performing providers at a reduced rate, the facility payment rate, for telehealth services reported using POS 02 (Telehealth). However, for all dates of service March 1, 2020 through the end of the current PHE, Medicare will pay the same amount for virtual services as it would if the service was provided in person.
Medicare""s non facility rate will now be paid for claims submitted with POS 11 (Office) Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 7 which is a higher rate than payment for claims billed with POS 22 (On Campus Outpatient Hospital) or POS 19 (Off Campus Outpatient Hospital).
Claims submitted with a POS in a hospital setting (e.g., 22, 19) will be paid at Medicare""s facility rate. Claims submitted with a POS of 02 (Telehealth), because the service would have been performed via telehealth means, will also be paid at Medicare""s facility rate.
For example, an established patient who would normally have been seen in the physician office is now seen using a real time audio and video platform (e.g., Apple
FaceTime, Doxy.me). An established patient visit CPT code, 9921x, is reported using POS 11 and the non facility payment allowable will be paid. Modifier 95 must be appended to the E/M code reported which will be discussed later in this Commentary.
CMS allows payment for virtual services to the following providers typically seen in Otolaryngology practices:  Physicians,  Non physician practitioners (NPP): nurse practitioners (NPs), physician assistants (PAs), clinical nurse specialists (CNSs), and  Therapists such as speech language pathologist (SLPs) and physical therapists (PTs). Journal Pre proof HCPCS II Code Q3014 (Telehealth originating site facility fee) Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 15
The facility that hosts the patient and telecommunications means, remote/distant from the telemedicine provider, may report Q3014 to obtain payment for the expense incurred for the remote provider""s evaluation. Originating facility site (also called ""hosting facility"") expenses include, but are not limited to, cost of the telecommunication, originating site staff, equipment, and the usual expense incurred to provide a service.
Originating sites include a physician""s office site remote to the telemedicine provider, hospital, rural health clinic, skilled nursing facility, and others identified by CMS. The originating site files a claim for Q3014 with place of service code (POS) 02 (Telehealth).
During this PHE, the patient will be at home for most telemedicine services provided by
Otolaryngologists. The patient""s home is not considered an approved originating site that qualifies for use of Q3014. HCPCS II code Q3014 should not be submitted to a payor by the distant Otolaryngologist.
Telephone Calls (99441)(99442)(99443)(98966)(98967)(98968) The telephone call CPT codes (99441)(99442)(99443)(98966)(98967)(98968) were previously noncovered and not payable by Medicare. However, telephone E/M services are now paid by Medicare for new and established patients due to the COVID 19 pandemic. Additionally, while CPT states these codes are for established patients, Medicare now allows payment for telephone only E/M codes for new patients. The telephone E/M codes are shown in Table 7. Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 16 Physicians and NPPs, called ""other qualified health care professionals"" by CPT, (e.g., physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists) that bill using their own NPI should use 99441 99443. ""Qualified non physician health care professionals,"" such as speech language pathologists and physical therapists, should use codes 98966 98968 for telephone assessment and management services, as shown in the table below. The codes below are not payable for services provided by auxiliary personnel such as Registered Nurses (RNs), Licensed Vocational Nurses/Licensed Practical Nurses (LVNs/LPNs), Medical Assistants (MAs), Nursing Assistants (NAs), etc.
CMS also requires that therapists use the appropriate therapy modifier (GP for PTs, GN for SLPs) for their services. Remember, CMS allows payment to audiologists only for diagnostic testing and not for telephone calls and does not pay for telephone services provided by auxiliary personnel.
Modifier 95 is not appended to the telephone call codes, 99441 99443 or 98966 98968, since CMS does not consider these codes to be telehealth services. Virtual Check Ins (G2010, G2012) Virtual Check Ins (G2010, G2012) may now be performed for both new and established patients even though the code descriptor states ""established patient."" The purpose of Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 17 these HCPCS II codes is to determine whether an E/M visit (9920x, 9921x) is needed. These services are initiated by the patient. Again, CMS allows payment to audiologists only for diagnostic testing and not for virtual check ins and does not pay for these services if provided by auxiliary personnel.
The descriptor for G2010 is:
""Remote evaluation of recorded video and/or images submitted by an established patient (e.g., store and forward), including interpretation with followup with the patient within 24 business hours, not originating from a related E/M service provided within the previous 7 days nor leading to an E/M service or procedure within the next 24 hours or soonest available appointment.""
The intent of G2010 is for the physician or other qualified practitioner, such as an NPP, to review photos or video information (e.g., recording of a cough) submitted by the patient to determine if a visit is required. The service may now be provided to a new or established patient when a related evaluation and management (E/M) service has not been provided in the previous seven days and does not lead to an E/M service within the next 24 hours or soonest available appointment. The provider responds to the patient by patient portal. If an office visit or other service (e.g., E/M service) is needed, and it is scheduled within 24 hours or the soonest available appointment, then G2010 would not be reported.
J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 18 CMS now allows therapists to report G2010 and the appropriate therapy modifier (GP for PTs, GN for SLPs) must be appended.
The descriptor for HCPCS II code G2012 is:
""Brief communication technology based service, e.g., virtual check in, by a physician or other qualified health care professional who can report evaluation and management services, provided to an established patient, not originating from a related E/M service provided within the previous 7 days nor leading to an E/M service or procedure within the next 24 hours or soonest available appointment; 5 10 minutes of medical discussion""
The intent of G2012 is that a physician or NPP would conduct a virtual check in, lasting 5 to 10 minutes, using a telephone or other telecommunication device to determine whether an office visit or other service is needed. If an office visit or other service (e.g., E/M service) is needed, and it is scheduled within 24 hours or the soonest available appointment, then G2012 would not be reported.
CMS now allows therapists report G2012 and the appropriate therapy modifier (GP for PTs, GN for SLPs) must be appended.
A telephone service code (99441 99443) may be reported by physicians or NPPs, in place of G2012, if the time threshold is met and the service does not result in the need for an E/M service in the next 24 hours/next available appointment or the service is Journal Pre proof G2010 is 0.18.
Medicare allows payment to SLPs and PTS for online (e.g., patient portal) assessment and management of patients. The HCPCS II codes used by healthcare professionals who don""t bill directly to Medicare for E/M services, are noted in Table 10 ."	0
2703	Internet of Things is a revolutionary domain that has the caliber to impact our lives and bring significant changes to the world. Several IoT applications have been envisioned to facilitate data driven and smart application for the user. Smart City and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) offer a futuristic vision of smart, secure and safe experience to the end user, and at the same time efficiently manage the sparse resources and optimize the efficiency of city operations. However, outbreaks and pandemics like COVID 19 have revealed limitations of the existing deployments, therefore, architecture, applications and technology systems need to be developed for swift and timely enforcement of guidelines, rules and government orders to contain such future outbreaks. This work outlines novel architecture, potential use cases and some future directions in developing such applications using Smart City and ITS.	0

2705	"The COVID 19 pandemic highlights the importance of effective non pharmaceutical public health interventions. While social distancing and isolation has been introduced widely, more moderate contact reduction policies could become desirable owing to adverse social, psychological, and economic consequences of a complete or near complete lockdown.
Adopting a novel social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three targeted distancing strategies designed to 'keep the curve flat' and aid compliance in a post lockdown world. We simulate stochastic infection curves that incorporate core elements from infection models, ideal type social network models, and statistical relational event models. Our models demonstrate that while social distancing measures clearly do flatten the curve, strategic reduction of contact can strongly increase their efficiency, introducing the possibility of allowing some social contact while keeping risks low. Limiting interaction to a few repeated 2 contacts emerges as the most effective strategy. Maintaining similarity across contacts and the strengthening of communities via triadic strategies are also highly effective. This approach provides empirical evidence which adds nuanced policy advice for effective social distancing that can mitigate adverse consequences of social isolation."	0
2706	"The COVID 19 pandemic is expanding at an unprecedented rate. As a result, diagnostic services are stretched to their limit, and there is a clear need for the provision of additional diagnostic capacity.
Academic laboratories, many of which are closed due to governmental lockdowns, may be in a position to support local screening capacity by adapting their current laboratory practices. Here, we describe the process of developing a SARS Cov2 diagnostic workflow in a conventional academic Containment Level 2 (CL2) laboratory. Our outline includes simple SARS Cov2 deactivation upon contact, the methods for a quantitative real time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT PCR) detecting SARS Cov2, a description of process establishment and validation, and some considerations for establishing a similar workflow elsewhere. This was achieved under challenging circumstances through the collaborative efforts of scientists, clinical staff, and diagnostic staff to mitigate to the ongoing crisis. Within 14 days, we created a validated COVID 19 diagnostics service for healthcare workers in our local hospital. The described methods are not exhaustive, but we hope may offer support to other academic frame."	0

• The integrated structure based approach identified potential inhibitors against SARS CoV 2 proteins • Structurally important binding site residues are elucidated through energy decomposition analysis • The structural insights provide important information for future drug development against COVID 19
The recently emerged SARS CoV 2 caused a major outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) and instigated a widespread fear, threatening global health security. To date, no licensed antiviral drugs or vaccines are available against COVID 19 although several clinical trials are underway to test possible therapies. During this urgency situation, computational drug discovery methods provide an alternative to tiresome high throughput screening, particularly in the hit to lead optimization stage. Identification of small molecules that specifically target viral replication the main protease, Nsp12 RNA polymerase and Nsp13 helicase. An integrative virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations approach led to the identification of potential binding modes and favourable molecular interaction profile of corresponding compounds. Moreover, the identification of structurally important binding site residues in conserved motifs located inside the active site highlights relative importance of ligand binding based on residual energy decomposition analysis. Although the current study lacks experimental validation, the structural information obtained from this computational study has paved way for the design of targeted inhibitors to combat COVID 19 outbreak."	1

2711	Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t test or Mann Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi squared test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. Results: Seventy eight patients with COVID 19 induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/ stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U = 4.932, P = 0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, x 2 = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]°C, U = 2.057, P = 0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, x 2 = 5.611, P = 0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U = 4.030, P = 0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62 ± 6.60 vs. 41.27 ± 4.55 g/L, U = 2.843, P = 0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (x 2 = 16.01, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628 44.864; P = 0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577 25.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999;, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942 40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098 50.000; P = 0.003), and C reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224À34.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression.

These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID 19 pneumonia.	0
2712	"Goal: As the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2019/2020 unfolds, a COVID 19 'Immunity Passport' has been mooted as a way to enable individuals to return back to work or be admitted to current off limits locations. While the quality of antibody testing and the likelihood of even attaining COVID 19 immunity continue to be researched, we address the issues involved in providing tamper proof and privacy preserving certification, both for COVID 19 immunity and in general. Methods: We developed a prototype mobile phone app and requisite distributed server architecture that facilitates instant verification of tamper proof test results. Personally identifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the app allows the enduser selectively to present only the specific test result with no other personal information revealed. Behind the scenes it relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called 'Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners Lee's decentralized personal data platform 'Solid', and (c) a consortium Ethereumbased blockchain. Results: Our mobile phone app and distributed server architecture enable the mixture of verifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive digital keys and/or data. For the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. doctor, pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is 'just another app' which takes only minutes to use. Conclusions: The app and distributed server architecture offer a prototype proof of concept that is readily scalable, applicable generically, and in effect 'waiting in the wings' for the biological issues, plus key ethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be resolved.

In this era of lockdown policies in most of the major cities around the world, we see a huge increase in people and professionals' engagement in social media. Social media is playing an important role in news propagation as well as keeping people in contact. At the same time, this source is both a blessing and a curse as the coronavirus infodemic has become a major concern, and is already a topic that needs special attention and further research.

For such a large scale epidemic, early detection and isolation of potential virus carriers is essential to curb the spread of the epidemic. Recent studies have shown that one important feature of COVID 19 is the abnormal respiratory status caused by viral infections. During the epidemic, many people tend to wear masks to reduce the risk of getting sick. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a portable non contact method to screen the health condition of people wearing masks through analysis of the respiratory characteristics. The device mainly consists of a FLIR one thermal camera and an Android phone. This may help identify those potential patients of COVID 19 under practical scenarios such as pre inspection in schools and hospitals. In this work, we perform the health screening through the combination of the RGB and thermal videos obtained from the dual mode camera and deep learning architecture. We first accomplish a respiratory data capture technique for people wearing masks by using face recognition. Then, a bidirectional GRU neural network with attention mechanism is applied to the respiratory data to obtain the health screening result. The results of validation experiments show that our model can identify the health status on respiratory with the accuracy of 83.7% on the real world dataset. The abnormal respiratory data and part of normal respiratory data are collected from Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to The Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School. Other normal respiratory data are obtained from healthy people around our researchers.	0

2719	"The outbreak of the new virus COVID 19, beyond the human health risks and loss, has caused also very serious problems in a wide range of human activities, including the basic and applied scientific research, mainly that concern world wide collaborations. It is desirable to all of us to have the prospect of quickly predicting a turning point in the daily cases curve of the disease. In this work we face the problem of COVID 19 virus disease spreading by aiming mostly to create a reliable mathematical model describing this mechanism for an isolated society, for cities or even for a whole country. Drawing upon similar mechanisms appearing in the particle detectors Physics, we concentrated to the so called, ""semi gaussian"" function of n degree. This approach can provide some very useful advantages in the data analysis of the daily reported cases of the infected people. Applying this model and fitting to the data, reported until the submission of this work, we have determined, among others, the mean infection time for a citizen in the society under study. We also applied and adopted this model to the reported cases in other countries and we have performed useful comparisons and conclusions."	0

2721	"The medical, health service, societal and economic impact of the COVID 19 emergency has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre COVID 19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID 19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts.
Methods: Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK  CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID 19 guidelines (16 March 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged ≥30 years from 1997 2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https://caliberresearch.org/portal), for each condition using ICD 10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1 year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID 19 related deaths assuming relative risk (RR) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0."	0
2722	This paper investigates the influence of air temperature and relative humidity on the transmission of COVID 19. After estimating the serial interval of COVID 19 from 105 hand collected pairs of the virus carrier and the infected, we calculate the daily effective reproductive number, R, for each of all 100 Chinese cities with more than 40 cases. Using the daily R values from January 21 to 23, 2020 as proxies of nonintervened transmission intensity, we find, under a linear regression framework, high temperature and high humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID 19, respectively. One degree Celsius increase in temperature and one percent increase in relative humidity lower R by 0.0225 and 0.0158, respectively. This result is consistent with the fact that the high temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of influenza and SARS. It indicates that the arrival of summer and rainy season in the northern hemisphere can effectively reduce the transmission of the COVID 19. We also developed a website to provide R of major humidity:	0
2723	During a burgeoning outbreak of a novel disease, public attention will ordinarily expand as the severity of the outbreak expands as infections multiply and news reports accumulate. Such public attention will in turn reinforce tactics to control the outbreak. In classical epidemiological models, effects of such tactics can be incorporated in standard parameters of transmission, recovery, and mortality. Unfortunately, early in an outbreak those individual parameters may be poorly known, hence corresponding models can get lost in uncertainty. This makes it difficult to determine whether the disease is spreading exponentially or logistically, or along another path. Examining cases over time is also problematic, as a logistically growing infection that is leveling off appears exponential in early phases. Here we report on the most basic mechanistic, ecological model we can imagine, which can help distinguish growth that is and is not under control. This approach did a satisfactory job predicting the final outcome of the Ebola outbreak of 2014 15. The model's two parameters were computable in real time, well before the outcome was actually known. The first parameter is an intrinsic rate of increase in cumulative deaths or reported cases. The second parameter is related to the human social system and represents all tactics that combine to control the outbreak. That parameter is coupled to the number of cumulative deaths or cases. We examine the basic mechanisms operating in this model and show the predictions made during the Ebola outbreak. We also consider how this basic model is performing for the Covid 19 pandemic and highlight ecological models that align with popularly discussed concepts such as flatten the curve, exponential growth, and inflection points of curves.	0

Un grand nombre d'infections humaines d'origine hydrique sont causées par des micro organismes qu'il s'agisse de virus, de bactéries ou encore de protozoaires. Ces micro organismes sont soit naturellement présents dans les environnements aquatiques, soit transférés au sein de ces derniers via des sources d'origine fécale. Ils séjournent dans ces environnements pendant un temps plus ou moins long avant de contaminer un nouvel hôte. Les environnements aquatiques sont soumis à une forte variabilité de leurs paramètres physicochimiques et abritent une vaste communauté microbienne plus ou moins adaptée à ces changements environnementaux. Ainsi les interactions entre les micro organismes, qu'ils soient pathogènes ou non, sont nombreuses et certaines d'entre elles sont encore aujourd'hui méconnues. L'objectif de cet article est de présenter les interactions connues entre certains micro organismes pathogènes et le milieu naturel en abordant notamment la diversité des sources de contamination, leur contribution dans la pollution microbiologique des milieux aquatiques, et le devenir des pathogènes dans des environnements notamment au travers des stratégies de survie que certains sont capables de développer.

2727	"COVID 19 caused by a novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province since December 2019, and caused a rapid outbreak throughout China and globally. Cities outside Hubei are also facing great challenge and require implementing of effective and feasible strategy in precision diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
We described a multicenter prospective study on diagnostic strategy of suspected NCP patients from January 22 nd to February 9 th , 2020 in Eastern China cities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory assessments, and computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained. Pathogen screen were performed including RT PCR, multiplex PCR, rapid flu antigen tests and mNGS.
We enrolled 53 suspected NCP patients, among whom 20 were laboratory confirmed. Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS CoV 2 RT PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positive for mNGS. Chest CT images and the symptoms of early stage NCP patients were similar to other viral pneumonia patients. We identified 11 of 20 co infections in NCP cases, including regular respiratory virus, fungi and bacteria synchronously. Genomic analysis showed that 8 of 10 cases had no mutation in virus genome, while 2 cases had only one single mutation in N gene.
Our study discovered that a combination of chest CT, SARS CoV 2 RT PCR and multi plex PCR is recommended in regions outside Hubei province. Co infection of other pathogens with SARS CoV 2 exists and should be acknowledged. Repeated sampling, change of specimen type or metagenomics sequencing could further facilitate during critical clinical cases."	0

DESIGN
Retrospective case series
Three designated COVID 19 care hospitals
Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020.
Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists.
Of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non severe patients. Compared with non severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 ± 15.0 years vs 48.9 ± 14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 All rights reserved.

2732	Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019 nCoV cases using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) have been published. A commercial RT PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point of care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019 nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS CoV and SARS CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019 nCoV. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations supported by high level evidence.	1

2734	Increasing evidence points to host Th17 inflammatory responses as contributing to the severe lung pathology and mortality of lower respiratory tract infections from coronaviruses. This includes host inflammatory and cytokine responses to COVID 19 caused by the SARS 2 coronavirus (SARS CoV2). From studies conducted in laboratory animals, there are additional concerns about immune enhancement and the role of potential host immunopathology resulting from experimental human COVID 19 vaccines. Here we summarize evidence suggesting there may be partial overlap between the underlying immunopathologic processes linked to both coronavirus infection and vaccination, and a role for Th17 coronavirus vaccines and immune enhancement and its reduction through alum adjuvants. Additional research may also clarify links between COVID 19 pulmonary immunopathology and heart disease.	1
2735	"Background: The world is facing the COVID 19 pandemic. Development of vaccine is challenging. Aim: To determine the proportion of people who intend to get vaccinated against COVID 19 in France or to participate in a vaccine clinical trial. Methods: We conducted an anonymous on line survey from the 26th of March to the 20th of April 2020. Primary endpoints were the intention to get vaccinated against COVID 19 if a vaccine was available or participate in a vaccine clinical trial. Results: Three thousand two hundred and fifty nine individuals answered the survey; women accounted for 67.4 % of the responders, 670 (20.6 %) were under 30 years of age, 1,502 (46.1 %) between 30 49 years, 803 (24.6 %) between 50 64 years, 271 (8.3%) between 65 80 years, 13 (0.4%) over 80 years of age. According to their statements, 2.512 participants (77.6%, 95 % CI 76.2 79 %)
will certainly or probably agree to get vaccinated against COVID 19. Older age, male gender, fear about COVID 19, being healthcare workers and individual perceived risk were associated with COVID 19 vaccine acceptance Vaccine hesitancy was associated with a decrease in COVID 19 vaccine acceptance. One thousand and five hundred and fifty responders (47.6 % 95 % CI 45.9 49.3 %) will certainly or probably agree to participate in a COVID 19 vaccine clinical trial.
Conclusions and Relevance: Nearly 75 % and 48 % of the survey responders were likely to accept vaccination or participation in a clinical trial against COVID 19. Vaccine hesitancy will be the major barrier to COVID 19 vaccine uptake."	0

2738	The current COVID 19 pandemic is affecting different countries in different ways. The assortment of reporting techniques alongside other issues, such as underreporting and budgetary constraints, makes predicting the spread and lethality of the virus a challenging task. This work attempts to gain a better understanding of how COVID 19 will affect one of the least studied countries, namely Brazil. Currently, several Brazilian states are in a state of lock down. However, there is political pressure for this type of measures to be lifted. This work considers the impact that such a termination would have on how the virus evolves locally. This was done by extending the SEIR model with an on / off strategy. Given the simplicity of SEIR we also attempted to gain more insight by developing a neural regressor. We chose to employ features that current clinical studies have pinpointed has having a connection to the lethality of COVID 19. We discuss how this data can be processed in order to obtain	1

Sources are mainly official reports from provincial, municipal or national health governments. Data included basic demographics (age, sex), travel histories and key dates (dates of onset of symptoms, hospitalization, and confirmation). Data were entered by a team of data curators on a rolling basis and technical validation and geo positioning protocols were applied continuously to ensure validity. A detailed description of the methodology is available (8). Lastly, total numbers were matched with officially reported data from China and other government reports. For sensitivity, GLM analyses (see below) were performed with case counts from the World Health Organization.
The proportion of cases who travelled while symptomatic was assessed from a subset of 236 cases for whom the dates of symptom onset and departure from Wuhan were available.
Residency was split into three categories: Wuhan, China and International. Foreigners living in Wuhan were categorized as Wuhan and patients with missing Wuhan residency were either kept as missing values or categorized according to their country of origin. Both parametric (χ² test, (28)) and non parametric (exact Fisher test, (29)) tests were performed and the uncertainty in proportions was assessed by the standard deviation of sample proportions.

2742	"Although single cell RNA sequencing studies have begun providing compendia of cell expression profiles, it has proven more difficult to systematically identify and localize all molecular cell types in individual organs to create a full molecular cell atlas. Here we describe droplet and plate based single cell RNA sequencing applied to ~75,000 human lung and blood cells, combined with a multi pronged cell annotation approach, which have allowed us to define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 of 45 previously known cell types or subtypes and 14 new ones. This comprehensive molecular atlas elucidates the biochemical functions of lung cell types and the cell selective transcription factors and optimal markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signaling interactions including sources and targets of chemokines in immune cell trafficking and expression changes on lung homing; and identifies the cell types directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory
viruses. Comparison to mouse identified 17 molecular types that appear to have been gained or lost during lung evolution and others whose expression profiles have been substantially altered, revealing extensive plasticity of cell types and cell type specific gene expression during organ evolution including expression switches between cell types. This atlas provides the molecular foundation for investigating how lung cell identities, functions, and interactions are achieved in development and tissue engineering and altered in disease and evolution.

2745	"Background: Japan's Prime Minister Abe declared an emergency to control the COVID 19 outbreak on April 7, 2020. He asked almost half of the population of Japan to reduce their personal contacts by 70 80%.
Object: This study estimates the effectiveness of that emergency declaration.
Method: We applied a simple susceptible infected recovery model to data of patients with symptoms in Tokyo, Japan for January 14  April 21 as of April 22. We estimate the reproduction number in four periods: R 0 before voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC) which was introduced since February 27 to March 19, R v during the VECSC, R a after VECSC, and R e after the emergency declaration.
: Results suggest that the value of R 0 was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, R v was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623]. R a was estimated as 2.307 [2.035, 2.794] and R e was 0.462 [0.347, 0.514].
Discussion and Concussion: One must be reminded that these results reflect only those at two weeks after the emergency declaration. The reproduction number probably changed thereafter continuously. : medRxiv preprint 44.5% of Japan's population, to restrict their trips outside the home voluntarily.
Voluntary compliance means that the declared measures were not enforced as law.
People were not arrested even if they do not comply with this government declaration.
At the same time, the policy required the reduction of contact by 70 80%, based on the author's earlier research [2] . However, the share of the population cooperating with government requirements without law enforcement has remained uncertain. Therefore, this policy's effects must be evaluated as nearly and in as real time a manner as possible.
If the reproduction number after the emergency declaration (R e ) is less than one, then the government would be able to rescind the declaration earlier. If greater than one, and especially of greater than two, then a more powerful policy, including law enforcement, might be necessary. Therefore, we undertook preliminary evaluation of the effect as of April 14, at one week after the declaration was issued.

Onset dates were sometimes unreported. Therefore, we estimated the onset date. To do so, we inferred a distribution of the length from onset to reporting based on patients for whom onset dates were available. Then we applied this empirical distribution to patients for whom onset dates were not available. Letting f(k) represent this empirical distribution and letting Nt denote the number of patients for whom onset dates were not available published at date t, then the number of patients for whom the onset date was : medRxiv preprint we estimated R a as the best fit to bootstrapped data in the post VECSC period. Finally, based on the obtained R 0 , R v , and R a , we estimated R e as the best fit to a bootstrapped data after the emergency was declared. For each step, reproduction numbers were grid searched in the interval of (0, 10) by 0.001 resolution.
Data used were the numbers of symptomatic patients in Tokyo, Japan during January 14  April 22 reported by Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) [6] as of April 23. During this period, 6084 cases with onset dates were reported. We excluded imported cases and those who were presumed to have been infected passengers and crew from the Diamond Princess: they were presumed not to be community acquired cases in Japan. Of those, onset dates were available for 3734 cases; onset dates were not reported for other cases.
All information used for this study has been published. There is therefore no ethical issue related to this study. Figure 1 depicts the empirical distribution among incubation periods of 91 cases for which exposure dates and onset dates were reported by MHLW. Its mode was six days.
Its average was 6.6 days. Figure 2 depicts the empirical distribution of duration from onset to report. We adjusted the reporting delay based on this distribution. The value of R 0 before VECSC was introduced was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, R v during the VECSC period when measures were introduced was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623]. After VECSC, R a was estimated as 2.307 [2.035, 2.794]. After the emergency declaration, R e decreased dramatically to be 0.462 [0.347, 0.514]. The null hypothesis that R v and R a were equal was not rejected,
however, all other pairs were equal was rejected at 5% significant level.
We applied a simple SIR model to all cases, including asymptomatic cases that had not been incorporated into the model to date. An earlier study [7 10] estimated R 0 for COVID 19 as 2.24 3.58 in Wuhan. Our R 0 obtained before VECSC was smaller than the previous studies , however, reproduction numbers in VECSC period and after VECSC were almost comparable. However, an earlier study [11] estimated R 0 in Japan All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
Our previous study estimated R e in the first a week after the emergency declaration at nationwide was 0.083 [0.067, 0.105]. However, the present study in Tokyo in the two weeks after declaration was 0.758 [0.631, 0.879] Even it was lower than one, it increased to be ten time higher from a week in nationwide. It might suggest the effect of the emergency declaration has been gradually disappearing or in Tokyo, it was higher than in nationwide.
Moreover, reproduction number in the VECSC period and after VECSC were almost the same in Tokyo, though in nationwide, reproduction number in the VECSC period (1. 028 [0.965, 1.191]) was much smaller than after VECSC (3.237 [3.005, 3.441]). This might means that VECSC was ineffective in Tokyo but effective other than Tokyo. In this sense, the effect of the emergency declaration might weak in Tokyo comparison with other area.

Results demonstrated that the reproduction number declined in the two weeks after the emergency declaration to be less than one, however, it might increase since the first week. The reproduction number must be monitored carefully and continuously. We hope that the present study contributes to government decision making about cessation of the emergency declaration.

2747	The primary cell surface receptor for SARS CoV 2 is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Recently it has been noticed that the viral Spike protein has an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins may be co receptors. We examined the sequences of ACE2 and integrins with the Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource, ELM, and were presented with candidate short linear motifs (SLiMs) in their short, unstructured, cytosolic tails with potential roles in endocytosis, membrane dynamics, autophagy, cytoskeleton and cell signalling. These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates. They suggest potential interactions with the AP2 µ2 subunit as well as I BAR, LC3, PDZ, PTB and SH2 domains found in signalling and regulatory proteins present in epithelial lung cells. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences, suggesting that they may act as molecular switches, often involving tyrosine phosphorylation status. Candidate LIR motifs are present in the tails of ACE2 and integrin β3, suggesting that these proteins can directly recruit autophagy components. We also noticed that the extracellular part of ACE2 has a conserved MIDAS structural motif, which are commonly used by β integrins for ligand binding, potentially supporting the proposal that integrins and ACE2 share common ligands. The findings presented here identify several molecular links and testable hypotheses that might help uncover the mechanisms of SARS CoV 2 attachment, entry and replication, and strengthen the possibility that it might be possible to develop host directed therapies to dampen the efficiency of viral entry and hamper disease progression. The strong sequence conservation means that these putative SLiMs are good candidates: Nevertheless, SLiMs must always be validated by experimentation before they can be stated to be functional. Receptor Mediated Endocytosis (RME) is a cellular import process triggered by cell surface receptor proteins, including any cargoes attached to them, in which a large vesicular structure is assembled entirely through cooperative low affinity interactions of SLiMs and phospholipid head groups with their globular protein domain partners. The vesicles are strong and stable, yet flexible and dynamically assembled and disassembled. The external triggering of surface receptors (many of which have the YxxPhi or NPxY tyrosine sorting motifs) is transmitted across the plasma membrane, inducing local enzymatic modification of lipid head groups from PI4P to (PI(4,5)P2) by the PIPK1 kinase. The local enrichment of (PI(4,5)P2) enables binding of domains such as ENTH in Epsins which can begin to curve the membrane and assemble clathrin cages using their Clathrin Box motif and also attract additional adapter proteins via yet more SLiMs. In turn, additional sets of SLiM bearing proteins stimulate the actin filament formation and attachment, necessary to fold and pull the invagination into the cytosol. Later, Dynamin binds directly to (PI(4,5)P2) on the membrane to complete the scission process. Once in the cytosol, the clathrin coated vesicles are soon dismantled and the contents are included into the early endosomes.

Here, we show that productive SARS CoV 2 infection in the lungs of mice is limited and restricted by early type I interferon responses. In contrast, we show that Syrian hamsters are highly permissive to SARS CoV 2. In wild type hamsters, SARS CoV 2 infection triggers bronchopneumonia and a strong inflammatory response in the lungs with neutrophil infiltration and edema. We further assess SARS CoV 2 induced lung pathology in hamsters by micro CT alike used in clinical practice.
Finally, we identify an exuberant innate response as key player in immune pathogenesis, in which STAT2 signaling plays a double edged role, driving severe lung injury on the one hand, yet restricting systemic virus dissemination on the other. Our results endorse hamsters as pre clinical model to rationalize and assess the therapeutic benefit of patients."	0

La neumonía adquirida en la comunidad (NAC) sigue siendo un problema sanitario de primer orden. En España, la incidencia de este tipo de infección es de 162 casos por cada 100.000 habitantes, lo que supone 53.000 hospitalizaciones al año y un coste de 115 millones de euros. Además, en los últimos años se han producido avances significativos en el conocimiento de la etiología y el diagnóstico de la enfermedad. Al mismo tiempo se está consiguiendo una mejor comprensión del problema derivado del aumento de las resistencias bacterianas, y han aparecido nuevas alternativas terapéuticas para el manejo de esta enfermedad. Por todo ello, un grupo de expertos pertenecientes a tres sociedades científicas de nuestro país (Sociedad Española de Medicina Intensiva, Crítica y Unidades Coronarias  SEMIC YUC; Sociedad Española de Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiología Clínica  SEIMC; Sociedad Española de Neumología y Cirugía Torácica  SE PAR) se han reunido para, tras una revisión crítica de la literatura, elaborar las presentes Guías para el manejo de la NAC. En ellas se abordan as pectos de epidemiología, índices pronósticos, etiología, diagnóstico, tratamiento y prevención de la enfermedad. El objetivo que se persigue es ayudar a los clínicos en la toma de decisiones, sin olvidar destacar la importancia que tiene el conocer las características particulares de la NAC en cada zona.

2755	One of the challenges today is to face fake news (false information) in health due to its potential impact on people's lives. This article contributes to a new application of social impact in social media (SISM) methodology. This study focuses on the social impact of the research to identify what type of health information is false and what type of information is evidence of the social impact shared in social media. The analysis of social media includes Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. This analysis contributes to identifying how interactions in these forms of social media depend on the type of information shared. The results indicate that messages focused on fake health information are mostly aggressive, those based on evidence of social impact are respectful and transformative, and finally, deliberation contexts promoted in social media overcome false information about health. These results contribute to advancing knowledge in overcoming fake health related news shared in social media.	0
2756	"BACKGROUND Nucleic acid test and antibody assay have been employed in the diagnosis for SARS CoV 2 infection, but the use of viral antigen for diagnosis has not been successfully developed. Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis.
METHODS We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS CoV 2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard.
We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS CoV 2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes. 100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method. In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed COVID 19 patients.
CONCLUSIONS Those findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of COVID 19. Appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the SARS CoV 2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value."	0

2760	Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are safe, cost effective, and reliable contraceptives, and are gaining popularity worldwide. While complications associated with IUD use are rare, they range from expulsion to uterine perforation. Numerous reports have been published regarding the sequelae of intraperitoneal copper IUDs or retained fragments following the removal of a fractured device. No data exist, however, on the intraperitoneal retention of copper following the removal of an otherwise intact IUD. Here we present two patients in whom copper IUDs were found to have missing fragments of copper wire despite removal of an otherwise intact IUD found in utero. We caution providers to examine all removed devices carefully, to surgically address intraperitoneal copper in order to mitigate adhesion formation, and to counsel patients about this potentially serious complication.

2768	Novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV [SARS COV 2]) was detected in humans during the last week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27 countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019 nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1 31 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019 nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4 th quantile being the highest risk and 1 st quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The risk index of 2019 nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the WHO reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus infected pneumonia (COVID 19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4 th quantile of the risk index, two in the 3 rd quantile, one in the 2 nd quantile and none in the 1 st quantile.

Cumulating research findings show that amino acid restrictions are potential strategies for cancer interventions. Meanwhile, dietary strategies are popular among cancer patients. However, there is still lacking solid rationale to clarify what is the best strategy, why and how it is. Here, integrated analyses and comprehensive summaries for the abundances, signalling and functions of amino acids in proteomes, metabolism, immunity and food compositions, suggest that, intermittent dietary lysine restriction with normal maize as an intermittent staple food for days or weeks, might have the value and potential for cancer prevention or therapy. Moreover, dietary supplements were also discussed for cancer cachexia including dietary immunomodulatory.	1

2772	"The global population is at present suffering from a pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). The goals of this study were to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict blueprints for designing universal vaccines against SARS CoV 2, that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of T cell epitopes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population. To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS CoV 2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA A, HLA B and HLA DR alleles in the human population, using host infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant ""epitope hotspot"" regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off target autoimmune responses. We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population."	0

One hundred hospitalized patients with Covid 19 were studied. Data on potential source of exposure, demographic, clinical, and paraclinical features, therapy outcome, and post discharge follow up were analyzed.
The median age of the patients was 58 years, and the majority of the patients (72.7%) were above 50 years of age. Fever was present in 45.2% of the patients on admission. The most common clinical symptoms were shortness of breath (74%) and cough (68%). Most patients had elevated C reactive protein (92.3%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (82.9%), lymphocytopenia (74.2 %) on admission. Lower lobes of the lung were most commonly involved, and ground glass opacity (81.8%) was the most frequent finding in CT scans. The administration of hydroxychloroquine improved the clinical outcome of the patients. Lopinavir/ritonavir was efficacious at younger ages. Of the 70 discharged patients, 40% had symptom relapse, (8.6%) were readmitted to the hospital, and 3 patients (4.3%) died.
This report demonstrates a heterogeneous nature of clinical manifestations in patients affected with Covid 19. The most common presenting symptoms are non specific, so attention should be made on broader testing, especially in age groups with the greatest risk and younger individuals who can serve as carriers of the disease. Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (in younger age group) can be potential treatment options.

To determine if SARS CoV 2 is present in sewage during the emergence of COVID 19 in the Netherlands, sewage samples of 7 cities and the airport were tested using RT PCR against three fragments of the nucleocapsid protein gene (N1 3) and one fragment of the envelope protein gene (E). No SARS CoV 2 was detected in samples of February 6, three weeks before the first case was reported in the Netherlands on February 27. On March 5, the N1 fragment was detected in sewage of five sites. On March 15/16, the N1 fragment was detected in sewage of six sites, and the N3 and E fragment were detected at 5 and 4 sites respectively. This is the first report of detection of SARS CoV 2 in sewage. The detection of the virus in sewage, even when the COVID 19 prevalence is low, indicates that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population.

Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, human activities are largely restricted in many regions in India since mid March of 2020, and it is a progressing experiment to testify effectiveness of restricted emissions. In this study, concentrations of six criteria pollutants, PM 10 , PM 2.5 , CO, NO 2 , ozone and SO 2 during March 16th to April 14th from 2017 to 2020 in 22 cities covering different regions of India were analysed. Overall, around 43, 31, 10, and 18% decreases in PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, and NO 2 in India were observed during lockdown period compared to previous years. While, there were 17% increase in O 3 and negligible changes in SO 2 . The air quality index (AQI) reduced by 44, 33, 29, 15 and 32% in north, south, east, central and western India, respectively. Correlation between cities especially in northern and eastern regions improved in 2020 compared to previous years, indicating more significant regional transport than previous years. The mean excessive risks of PM reduced by~52% nationwide due to restricted activities in lockdown period. To eliminate the effects of possible favourable meteorology, the WRF AERMOD model system was also applied in Delhi NCR with actual meteorology during the lockdown period and an un favourable event in early November of 2019 and results show that predicted PM 2.5 could increase by only 33% in unfavourable meteorology. This study gives confidence to the regulatory bodies that even during unfavourable meteorology, a significant improvement in air quality could be expected if strict execution of air quality control plans is implemented.	0
2787	The COVID 19 pandemic has precipitated a global crisis, with more than 690,000 confirmed cases and more than 33,000 confirmed deaths globally as of March 30, 2020 [1 4]. At present two central public health control strategies have emerged: mitigation and suppression (e.g, [5] ). Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by reducing interactions (and both raise questions of sustainability and long term tactics). Complementary to those approaches, here we develop and analyze an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests [6, 7] to identify and deploy recovered individuals as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, i.e., to develop what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. Recovered individuals, in the present context, represent those who have developed protective, antibodies to SARS CoV 2 and are no longer shedding virus [8] . The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services (including but not limited to tending to the elderly [9], hospital care, schools, and food supply) while decreasing the probability of transmission during such essential interactions. We show that a shield immunity approach may significantly reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of an outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well recognized roles in estimating prevalence [10, 11] and in .	0
2788	With the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) that results in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19), corporate entities, federal, state, county, and city governments, universities, school districts, places of worship, prisons, health care facilities, assisted living organizations, daycares, homeowners, and other building owners and occupants have an opportunity to reduce the potential for transmission through built environment (BE) mediated pathways. Over the last decade, substantial research into the presence, abundance, diversity, function, and transmission of microbes in the BE has taken place and revealed common pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms. In this paper, we synthesize this microbiology of the BE research and the known information about SARS CoV 2 to provide actionable and achievable guidance to BE decision makers, building operators, and all indoor occupants attempting to minimize infectious disease transmission through environmentally mediated pathways. We believe this information is useful to corporate and public administrators and pandemics.	0

2791	In the wake of COVID 19 disease, caused by the SARS CoV 2 virus, we designed and developed a predictive model based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning algorithms to determine the health risk and predict the mortality risk of patients with COVID 19. In this study, we used documented data of 117,000 patients world wide with laboratory confirmed COVID 19. This study proposes an AI model to help hospitals and medical facilities decide who needs to get attention first, who has higher priority to be hospitalized, triage patients when the system is overwhelmed by overcrowding, and eliminate delays in providing the necessary care. The results demonstrate 93% overall accuracy in predicting the mortality rate. We used several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to predict the mortality rate in patients with COVID 19. In this study, the most alarming symptoms and features were also identified. Finally, we used a separate dataset of COVID 19 patients to evaluate our developed model accuracy, and used confusion matrix to make an in depth analysis of our classifiers and calculate the sensitivity and specificity of our model.	0

Objetivo: Minimizar la exposición al virus SARS CoV 2, reducir las posibilidades de transmisión cruzada entre pacientes y personal sanitario, y evitar el desarrollo de complicaciones postoperatorias por la atención a pacientes con enfermedades oculares durante la pandemia de Enfermedad por Coronavirus 2019 .
Métodos: Elaboración de un documento de revisión del estado del conocimiento sobre COVID 19 y consenso entre diferentes sociedades oftalmológicas españolas y afines, al objeto de proporcionar guías y recomendaciones de máximos recursos primariamente condicionadas por Page 3 of 26 J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 3 el estado de alerta, confinamiento y distanciamiento social que acontece en España desde el 16 de marzo de 2020.
Resultados: Las recomendaciones promoverán la adopción de medidas de actuación y protección para el desarrollo de la actividad asistencial en consultas externas, área quirúrgica y hospitalización, tanto para pacientes no confirmados  asintomáticos y sintomáticos  como confirmados de COVID 19. Deberán ser adaptadas a las circunstancias y disponibilidad de Equipos de Protección Individual (EPI) en cada uno de los Centros y Comunidades Autónomas, debiendo ser actualizadas en función de las fases de la pandemia y de las medidas que adopte el Gobierno de la Nación.
Conclusiones: Durante la pandemia COVID 19, la atención a los potenciales riesgos de salud para la población ocasionados por el coronavirus deberá prevalecer sobre la posible progresión de enfermedades oculares comunes. Tanto médicos oftalmólogos como restantes profesionales de la salud ocular deberán asumir una posible progresión de dichas enfermedades ante la imposibilidad de un seguimiento adecuado de los pacientes. ABSTRACT Objective: Minimize exposure to the SARS CoV 2, reduce the chances of cross transmission between patients and healthcare personnel, and prevent the development of postoperative complications from the management of patients with eye diseases during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID  19). Methods: COVID 19 literature review and consensus establishment between different Spanish ophthalmology societies in order to provide guidelines and recommendations of maximum resources primarily conditioned by the state of alert, confinement and social distancing that occurs in Spain since March 16, 2020. Results: The recommendations will promote the adoption of action and protection measures for eye care in outpatient clinics, surgical areas and hospitalization, for unconfirmed (asymptomatic and symptomatic) and confirmed COVID 19 patients. Measures must be adapted to the circumstances and availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in each of the centers and Autonomous Communities, which will be updated according to the pandemic phases and the measures adopted by the Spanish Government. Conclusions: During the COVID 19 pandemic, attention to the potential health risks to the population caused by coronavirus should prevail over the possible progression of the common Page 4 of 26 J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 4 eye diseases.
Ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals must assume a possible progression of these diseases due to the impossibility of adequate patient follow up.
El presente documento ha sido producto de la revisión del estado del conocimiento y del consenso entre diferentes sociedades nacionales de oftalmología. Recoge recomendaciones de máximos para la atención a pacientes oftalmológicos, tanto COVID positivos como negativos, durante la pandemia por coronavirus SARS CoV 2. Dichas recomendaciones deberán ser adaptadas a las circunstancias y disponibilidad de los equipos en cada uno de los centros y comunidades, debiendo ser actualizadas en función del desarrollo de la pandemia en las próximas semanas. No serán de aplicación una vez que se levante el estado de alarma.
Durante este periodo la atención a los potenciales riesgos de salud para la población general ocasionados por la pandemia COVID 19 debe primar sobre la posible progresión de enfermedades tales como el glaucoma crónico, la retinopatía diabética, la degeneración macular asociada a la edad (DMAE), enfermedades corneales e inflamatorias, entre otras.
Debemos asumir una posible progresión de dichas enfermedades por la imposibilidad de un seguimiento adecuado de nuestros pacientes.
Los pacientes sintomáticos con COVID 19 suelen presentar síntomas respiratorios, como fiebre, tos y disnea; otros síntomas incluyen rash, mialgias, trastornos gastrointestinales, pérdida del gusto y del olfato. La conjuntivitis también se ha notificado. Las complicaciones graves incluyen neumonía y síndrome de distress respiratorio agudo (SDRA). El periodo de incubación de la enfermedad puede oscilar entre 2 y 24 días, durante el que cualquier paciente infectado puede estar asintomático y resultar contagioso. [1][2] [3] [4] Por otra parte, el SARS CoV 2 se transmite por aerosoles o gotitas respiratorias a la conjuntiva 5 7 , pudiendo ser la conjuntivitis la primera manifestación de la infección sistémica. 8 En un estudio de Journal of Medical Virology de 30 pacientes hospitalizados por COVID 19 en China, uno tuvo conjuntivitis. Sólo éste tenía SARS CoV 2 en sus secreciones oculares. Por tanto, el SARS CoV 2 puede infectar la conjuntiva y causar conjuntivitis, y las partículas del Page 5 of 26 J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 5 virus están presentes en las secreciones oculares. En un estudio más amplio publicado en New
England Journal of Medicine, los investigadores documentaron ""congestión conjuntival"" en 9 de 1.099 pacientes (0,8%) con COVID 19 confirmado en laboratorio de 30 hospitales de China. 1,5 8 Debido a la alta capacidad de transmisión del SARS CoV 2 es necesario guardar una distancia de seguridad mayor de 1,5 metros para reducir el riesgo de contagio. 9 Dado que la exploración oftalmológica se realiza a 30 cm en lámpara de hendidura e incluso más cerca en algunas maniobras concretas (medida de presión intraocular, oftalmoscopia directa), debe ser considerada de riesgo y manejada de acuerdo a las medidas estándares en esos casos. 4, 7, 8, 10, 11 Con todas estas evidencias los oftalmólogos, enfermeras y auxiliares de oftalmología, y ópticos optometristas son extremadamente vulnerables durante las exploraciones en consulta, siendo la oftalmología una de las especialidades médicas más afectadas en la pandemia actual 1 . Por otra parte, debido a la realización de consultas de alto rendimiento, los pacientes con frecuencia pasan más de hora y media en ellas. Además, la edad media de los pacientes es muy elevada, siendo esta población la que mayor mortalidad y morbilidad presenta en la infección por SARS CoV 2. Finalmente, los profesionales sanitarios pueden actuar como agentes transmisores de la enfermedad sobre una población de riesgo por lo que deben seguir estrictamente las medidas preventivas.
La enfermedad COVID 19 es por tanto transmisible por las secreciones conjuntivales y la conjuntivitis presentarse de forma variable, según las series publicadas entre el 0,9 y 31,6% de los pacientes con la enfermedad. Esto aumenta la probabilidad de que los oftalmólogos sean los primeros proveedores en evaluar pacientes posiblemente infectados por SARS CoV 2. Dado el estrecho contacto con el paciente a través de la lámpara de hendidura, oftalmoscopios, tonómetros y restantes equipos, los cuales requieren una proximidad menor de un metro, se deberán tomar las siguientes medidas:
1. Todos los pacientes que acudan a la consulta deben ser convenientemente evaluados mediante un triaje antes de acceder a la sala de espera en busca de las siguientes condiciones para identificar la posible exposición al SARS CoV 2:
• ¿Su paciente tiene fiebre, malestar general, síntomas respiratorios (tos seca, disnea), ageusia, anosmia, diarrea o cefalea? Page 6 of 26 J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 6 • ¿Su paciente presenta síntomas de conjuntivitis como ojo rojo, secreción, escozor, picor ocular o fotofobia de forma aguda? • ¿Su paciente convive, ha convivido o ha tenido contacto con algún familiar o personas estrechamente relacionadas que hayan sido diagnosticadas o estén en cuarentena por el COVID 19 en los últimos 14 días?
2. Sólo se evaluarán pacientes con patología ocular urgente en ausencia de síntomas de infección por coronavirus. En caso de pacientes con síntomas sospechosos o positivos confirmados que además presenten verdaderas emergencias oculares (perforación ocular, glaucoma agudo), serán remitidos a los servicios de urgencia de los hospitales de referencia (apartado A2, a) 3. Salas de espera con máximo de un acompañante en caso de ser necesario y distancia de 2 metros entre individuos. Evitar la acumulación de pacientes en las salas de espera o de procedimientos.
4. Exploración oftalmológica (ver recomendaciones: generales, A1 y A2).
Desinfección de todas las superficies de unidades, lentes y equipos (apéndice A)
1. Toda la actividad no urgente debe ser demorada. 1 Siempre que sea posible se favorecerá la consulta no presencial telemática (llamada de voz, videollamada), y se reprogramarán a los pacientes cuando sea posible hacerlo de forma segura tras la primera fase de la crisis 1,7,8 . Debe considerase cuidadosamente el balance entre el riesgo/beneficio tanto sistémico como oftalmológico para el paciente en todos los casos.

2794	The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease caused by SARS CoV 2 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To develop specific anti coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a SARS CoV 2 spike (S) protein mediated cell cell fusion assay and found that SARS CoV 2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS CoV. We solved the X ray crystal structure of six helical bundle (6 HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS CoV 2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS CoV and MERS CoV. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS CoV 2 S protein mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241 and 149 fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS CoV and MERS CoV, as well as SARSr CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS CoV 2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS CoV 2 and other emerging SARSr CoVs.	0
2795	"Importance: India has taken strong and early public health measures for arresting the spread of the COVID 19 epidemic. With only 536 COVID 19 cases and 11 fatalities, India  a democracy of 1.34 billion people  took the historic decision of a 21 day national lockdown on March 25. The lockdown was further extended to May 3rd, soon after the analysis of this paper was completed.
Objective: To study the short and long term impact of an initial 21 day lockdown on the total number of COVID 19 cases in India compared to other less severe non pharmaceutical interventions using epidemiological forecasting models and Bayesian estimation algorithms; to compare effects of hypothetical durations of lockdown from an epidemiological perspective; to study alternative explanations for slower growth rate of the virus outbreak in India, including exploring the association of the number of cases and average monthly temperature; and finally, to outline the pivotal role of reliable and transparent data, reproducible data science methods, tools and products as we reopen the country and prepare for a post lock down phase of the pandemic.
We use the daily data on the number of COVID 19 cases, of recovered and of deaths from March 1 until April 7, 2020 from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Additionally, we use COVID 19 incidence counts data from Kaggle and the monthly average temperature of major cities across the world from Wikipedia.
The current time series data on daily proportions of cases and removed (recovered and death combined) from India are analyzed using an extended version of the standard SIR (susceptible, infected, and removed) model. The eSIR model incorporates timevarying transmission rates that help us predict the effect of lockdown compared to other hypothetical interventions on the number of cases at future time points. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation of this model provided predicted proportions of the cases at future time points along with credible intervals (CI).
Our predicted cumulative number of COVID 19 cases in India on April 30 assuming a 1 week delay in people's adherence to a 21 day lockdown (March 25  April 14) and a gradual, moderate resumption of daily activities after April 14 is 9,181 with upper 95% CI of 72,245. In comparison, the predicted cumulative number of cases under ""no intervention"" and ""social distancing and travel bans without lockdown"" are 358 thousand and 46 thousand (upper 95% CI of nearly 2.3 million and 0.3 million) respectively. An effective lockdown can prevent roughly 343 thousand (upper 95% CI 1.8 million) and 2.4 million (upper 95% CI 38.4 million) COVID 19 cases nationwide compared to social distancing alone by May 15 and June 15, respectively. When comparing a 21 day lockdown with a hypothetical lockdown of longer duration, we find that 28 , 42 , and 56 day lockdowns can approximately prevent 238 thousand (upper 95% CI 2.3 million),
We are committed to data transparency and reproducible research.

2796	In response to the critical shortage of medical masks resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic, large portions of the population are mobilizing to produce cloth masks using locally sourced fabrics, however the efficacy of these masks as a means of protecting the wearer from airborne particles carrying virus is not well known. Further, existing protocols are designed for testing the fit and performance N95 respirators and tight fitting facemasks rather than the relatively more loose fitting surgical mask style most cloth masks follow. In this study tools and methods typically used to assess tight fitting facemasks were modified to assess the efficacy of community produced fabric and commercially produced surgical masks in terms of protecting the wearer from airborne particles that may be carrying virus. Two TSI PortaCount (model 8028) instruments were operated concurrently to collect particle counts (particles/cm 3 ) in size range 0.02 to >1 µm from ambient air and air just inside the breathing zone of the mask (1 measurement per second, evaluation period of 1 minute per test). Percent particle removal was determined for ten home made, fabric masks of different designs, with and without filter layers, as well as three commercially produced surgical type masks. N95 masks were used to validate the method, and a 3M model 1826 surgical mask was used as a baseline for comparison of other masks of this style. Homemade masks worn as designed always had lower particle removal rates than the 3M masks, achieving between 38% and 96% of this baseline. As has been previously observed by Cooper et al. (1983), adding a layer of nylon stocking over the masks minimized the flow of air around the edges of the masks and improved particle filtration efficiency for all masks, including all commercial products tested. Use of a nylon stocking overlayer brought the particle filtration efficiency for five of the ten fabric masks above the 3M surgical mask baseline. This rapid testing method (<2 hours per mask design) provides a holistic evaluation of mask particle removal efficacy (material, design, and fit), and use of this method for testing a wider range of mask materials and designs will provide the public and health care providers with information needed to optimize health protection given resources at hand.	0

2799	Many countries have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, emergency mental health legislation in response to the global pandemic of . In Ireland, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid 19) Act, 2020 amends the Mental Health Act 2001 to permit the Mental Health Commission to request an independent psychiatric report about an involuntary patient from any consultant psychiatrist who is not treating the patient (and not just those on its designated panel). This independent examination may occur 'in person', 'by other appropriate means', or even, 'due to the exigencies of the public health emergency', not occur at all, once this is explained in the resultant report. The 2020 Act acknowledges that 'the exigencies of the public health emergency' might hamper the independent psychiatrist's work and requires a written report from the patient's treating psychiatrist 'no earlier than the day before' the tribunal, in lieu of the psychiatrist physically attending a tribunal hearing, although, if possible, they will attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. The 2020 Act permits the Mental Health Commission to, if necessary, appoint tribunals 'consisting of one member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor'. Such a tribunal shall, if possible, consult with a consultant psychiatrist if the reports from the independent psychiatrist and treating psychiatrist conflict or if it is otherwise 'necessary in the interest of the patient'. A tribunal can extend an involuntary order by a second period of 14 days 'of its own motion if the tribunal, having due regard to the interest of the patient, is satisfied that it is necessary'. Tribunals for current involuntary patients will be prioritised over retrospective tribunals for discharged patients; a tribunal can direct a witness to provide 'a written statement' rather than attending; and the patient can make written representation to the tribunal instead of physically attending a tribunal hearing, although they may attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. Psycho surgery for involuntary patients is banned. While it is clear that revisions are urgent and necessary in J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f Journal Pre proof light of Covid 19, the proportionality of these changes will depend on how, and the extent to which, they are used in practice. With good communication, efficient team working and close adherence to professional codes of practice and ethics, it is hoped that these amendments will result in a review system that is as reasonable, robust and reassuring as the current, highly unusual circumstances permit.	0
2800	The rapid onset of COVID 19 and its huge burden on resources requires coordinated action across many areas of the healthcare system including staffing, equipment supply chains, bed management, diagnostic capabilities, nursing and medical treatment, infection control, and hygiene skills compliance [6]. There are other publications providing practical guidance for simulation activities focusing taking COVID 19 related history from patients and relatives, decision making and triaging, escorting patients, and self protection against contamination [22, 23].	1
2801	"The official data for the time evolution of active cases of COVID 19 pandemics around the world are available online. For all countries, a peak has been either observed (China and South Korea) or is expected in near future. The approximate dates and heights of those peaks imply in important epidemiological issues. Inspired by similar complex behaviour of volumes of transactions of stocks at NYSE and NASDAQ, we propose a q statistical functional form which appears to describe satisfactorily the available data of all countries. Consistently, predictions become possible of the dates and heights of those peaks in severely affected countries unless efficient treatments or vaccines, or sensible modifications of the adopted epidemiological strategies, emerge.
It is possible to predict the thermostatistical properties of uncountable physical systems at thermal equilibrium through the one body distribution p( ) ∝ ω( )e −β , where ω( ) is the density of states as a function of the energy , multiplied by the celebrated Boltzmann factor e −β , β being the inverse temperature. The function ω( ) comes from mechanical considerations (classical, quantum, relativistic) related with the number of degrees of freedom, and does not depend on the temperature; the exponential weight comes instead from standard statistical mechanical considerations. In many cases it is, either exactly or approximatively, w( ) ∝ α (α ∈ R). For thermostatistical properties of the stationary or quasi stationary state of wide classes of complex systems, the Boltzmann factor is to be generalised into the q exponential factor e −βq q
This procedure yielded quite satisfactory results for the high frequency stock market in NYSE, NASDAQ and elsewhere [4] [5] [6] .
Let us focus now on the data available for the COVID 19 pandemics. Briefly after the beginning of the pandemics, several studies analysing the available data, and employing different models and candidate functions, started to appear in the literature [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Most of them are interested in the behaviour of total cases and fatality curves. We will concentrate here on the analysis of the active cases and deaths per day. The inspection of the public data [12] (updated on a daily basis), in particular of the time evolution of the number N of active cases (surely a lower bound of the unknown actual numbers) showed a rather intriguing similarity with the distributions of volumes of stocks. Along this line we adopt the following functional form for each country or region:
with C > 0; α > 0; β > 0; γ > 0, q > 1 and t 0 ≥ 0. This constant t 0 characterises the beginning of the epidemics in that particular region; it is typically somewhat larger than the date of appearance of the first case. The normalising constant C reflects the total population of that particular country. For α = 0, if γ = 1 we recover the standard q exponential expression; if γ = 2, it is currently referred in the literature as q Gaussian; for other values of γ, it is referred to as stretched q exponential. Through the inspection of the roles played by the four nontrivial parameters, namely (α, β, γ, q), it became rather transparent that (α, β) depend strongly on the epidemiological strategy implemented in that region, in addition to the biological behaviour of the coronavirus in that geographical climate. In contrast, the parameters (γ, q) appear to be sort of universal, mainly depending on the coronavirus. Therefore, we investigate several countries with the basic assumption that these two parameter would not change much from one country to another and we fixed these values at the values that we determine for China since this country has already had nearly the full evolution of the pandemics. For several countries, except South Korea, this assumption seems to be working. The results of China and South Korea are given in Fig. 1 . It is evident that, although the functional form (1) does yield satisfactory results for both China and South Korea, the (γ, q) parameter values differ somewhat for each of these countries. On the other hand, as can be easily seen from Fig. 2 , our assumption is corroborated by several * Electronic address: tsallis@cbpf.br †"	0

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) emerged in 2019 as the causative agent 2 of the novel pandemic viral disease COVID 19. With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the 3 urgent need for safe, broad spectrum antiviral countermeasures against SARS CoV 2 and future emerging 4
CoVs. We report that remdesivir (RDV), a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog, 5 potently inhibits SARS CoV 2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial 6 cultures (EC50 = 0.01 µM). Weaker activity was observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 µM) due to their 7 low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS 8
CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, of SARS CoV 2. In mice 9 infected with chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminished lung viral load and improved 10 pulmonary function as compared to vehicle treated animals. These data provide evidence that RDV is 11 was not certified by peer review) RNA 15 polymerase, therapeutic, mouse. 16 17 C adenosine analog GS 441524, potently inhibits replication of a broad spectrum of pre pandemic bat 30 CoVs and human epidemic CoVs in primary human lung cell cultures (Agostini et al., 2018; Brown et al., 31 2019; Sheahan et al., 2017). Biochemical analysis of the mechanism of inhibition of the SARS CoV 2, 32 SARS CoV 1, and MERS CoV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) revealed that incorporation of 33 the active metabolite RDV triphosphate (RDV TP) was more efficient than the natural substrate ATP and 34 led to delayed chain termination three nucleotides downstream of incorporation (Gordon et al., 2020a, 35 2020b). Prolonged passaging of murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a group 2a CoV, in the presence of GS 36 441524 resulted in low level resistance through mutations in the RdRp, further implicating this protein as 37 the drug target (Agostini et al., 2018). RDV showed both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in mouse 38 models of SARS and MERS and against MERS CoV challenge in a rhesus macaque model (Sheahan et 39 al., 2017(Sheahan et 39 al., , 2020a Wit et al., 2020).

2805	"With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes.
A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID 19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression.
Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Further, multivariate regression indicated that age over 65 years, smoking, critical disease status, diabetes, high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg/mL), leukocytosis (>10 x 10 9 /L) and neutrophilia (>75 x 10 9 /L) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the use of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Survival analysis also confirmed that patients receiving hypnotics had significantly better survival.
To our knowledge, this is the first indication that hypnotics could be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID 19. We also found that novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive .

2806	As of early March, 2019 nCoV has infected more than one hundred thousand people and claimed thousands of lives. 2019 nCoV is a novel form of coronavirus that causes COVID 19 and has high similarity with SARS CoV. No approved vaccine yet exists for any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019 nCoV T cell and B cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC I and MHC II alleles, and two potential neutralizing Bcell epitopes near the 2019 nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440 460 and 494 506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS CoV experimental data.	0

Although there is an association between cardiovascular disease and COVID 19, the majority of patients who need cardiovascular care for the management of ischemic heart disease may not be infected with COVID 19. The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for a systematic approach for the care of patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID 19 pandemic. There is a recognition of two major challenges in providing recommendations for AMI care in the COVID 19 era. Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID 19 are complex with patients presenting with AMI, myocarditis simulating a STelevation MI presentation, stress cardiomyopathy, non ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary spasm, or nonspecific myocardial injury and the prevalence of COVID 19 disease in the US population remains unknown with risk of asymptomatic spread. This document addresses the care of these patients focusing on 1) the varied clinical presentations; 2) appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers; 3) role of the Emergency Department, Emergency Medical System and the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory; and 4) Regional STEMI systems of care. During the COVID 19 pandemic, primary PCI remains the standard of care for STEMI patients at PCI capable hospitals when it can be provided in a timely fashion, with an expert team outfitted with PPE in a dedicated CCL room. A fibrinolysis based strategy may be entertained at non PCI capable referral hospitals or in specific situations where primary PCI cannot be executed or is not deemed the best option.	0

Objective  To characterize the clinical features of patients with severe COVID 19 in the UK.
Design  Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near realtime analysis, using a pre approved questionnaire adopted by the WHO. Setting  166 UK hospitals between 6 th February and 18 th April 2020. Participants 16,749 people with COVID 19.
Interventions  No interventions were performed, but with consent samples were taken for research purposes. Many participants were co enrolled in other interventional studies and clinical trials. Results  The median age was 72 years [IQR 57, 82; range 0, 104], the median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days [IQR 1, 8] and the median duration of hospital stay was 7 days [IQR 4, 12] . The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (29%), uncomplicated diabetes (19%), non asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (19%) and asthma (14%); 47% had no documented reported comorbidity. Increased age and comorbidities including obesity were associated with a higher probability of mortality. Distinct clusters of symptoms were found: 1. respiratory (cough, sputum, sore throat, runny nose, ear pain, wheeze, and chest pain); 2. systemic (myalgia, joint pain and fatigue); 3. enteric (abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea). Overall, 49% of patients were discharged alive, 33% have died and 17% continued to receive care at date of reporting. 17% required admission to High Dependency or Intensive Care Units; of these, 31% were discharged alive, 45% died and 24% continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 20% were discharged alive, 53% died and 27% remained in hospital.
Conclusions  We present the largest detailed description of COVID 19 in Europe, demonstrating the importance of pandemic preparedness and the need to maintain readiness to launch research studies in response to outbreaks."	0
2811	The coronavirus (CoV) family consists of viruses that infects a variety of animals including humans with various levels of respiratory and fecal oral transmission levels depending on the behavior of the viruses' natural hosts and optimal viral fitness. A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS CoV using AI and empirically based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS CoV (M PID = 8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal oral transmission potentials. Later, MERS CoV (M PID = 9%, N PID = 44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal oral transmission capabilities. Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS CoV 2 (M PID = 6%, N PID = 48%) has to be placed in Category B. Our data show however, that the SARS CoV 2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell, (M PID = 6%) among coronaviruses. This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body. An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers of viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids. These particles are also likelier to remain active longer. These factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the SARS CoV 2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread.	0
2812	Scientists risk health incidents, from sharp or emerging epidemics—such as SARS or the ongoing COVID‐19—to long‐term health effects—notably DVT, red tape issues, such as visas and border checks, and weather‐related snags, such as dreadful delays, time away from home with whatever this entails 2, hidden yet real costs that cannot be directly reported and even serious life‐threatening situations 3. We can remember other dire moments: a colleague who passed away from DVT as a frequent flyer across continents, confusing protocols over passports/IDs, visa waivers or the “Schengen Treaty,” violent accidents.	0
2813	"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has emerged as a rapidly spreading global pathogen stressing the need for development of rapid testing protocols ever than before. The aim of present study was to develop a SARS CoV 2 detection protocol which can be performed within minimal resources and timeframe. For this purpose, we implemented the reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT LAMP) methodology for the qualitative detection of SARS CoV 2 RNA. In order to improve the detection capability, the RT LAMP assay was developed to simultaneously amplify two viral genes: ORF1a and N. A total of 45 SARS CoV 2 associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) and 25 non COVID 19 cases were enrolled. Viral RNA was extracted from the nasopharyngeal swab samples and analyzed simultaneously using PCR and RT LAMP protocols.
Overall, our SARS CoV 2 dual gene RT LAMP assay was found to be 95% accurate in detecting positive cases and showed no cross reactivity or false positive results in non COVID 19 samples. Further evaluation on larger and multi centric cohorts is currently underway to establish the diagnostic accuracy and subsequent implementation into clinical practice and at point of care settings."	0
2814	This review aimed to summarize and analyze the pattern identification (PI), herbal formulae, and composition of herbs provided by recent guidelines for the treatment of pediatric COVID 19. Seven data sources were reviewed until March 25, 2020. We analyzed the herbal formulae included in the guidelines and performed a network analysis to identify the frequency of herbs recommended in the herbal formulae. All 3 guidelines were provincial guidelines from China. Our results showed that there were 4 stages, 12 PIs, and 13 herbal formulae recommended by the provincial guidelines. These herbal formulae included a total of 56 herbs. Based on our network analysis, Scutellariae Radix was paired with Artemisiae Annuae Herba in one cluster. In another cluster, Armeniacae Semen was paired with Coicis Semen and Ephedrae Herba was paired with Gypsum Fibrosum. This review serves as a reference for the use of traditional medicine in the treatment of pediatric COVID 19.	0
2815	Social distancing, often in the form of lockdown, has been adopted by many countries as a way to contrast the spreading of COVID 19. We discuss the temporal aspects of social distancing in contrasting an epidemic diffusion. We argue that a strategy based uniquely on social distancing requires to maintain the relative measures for a very long time, while a more articulate strategy, which also uses early detection and prompt isolation, can be both more efficient on reducing the epidemic peak and allow to relax the social distancing measures after a much shorter time. We consider in more detail the situation in Italy, simulating the effect of different strategies through a recently introduced SIR type epidemiological model. The short answer to the question	1
2816	The COVID 19 outbreak has become a global pandemic responsible for over 2,000,000 confirmed cases and over 126,000 deaths worldwide. In this study, we examined the immunogenicity of CHO expressed recombinant SARS CoV 2 S1 Fc fusion protein in mice, rabbits, and monkeys as a potential candidate for a COVID 19 vaccine. We demonstrate that the S1 Fc fusion protein is extremely immunogenic, as evidenced by strong antibody titers observed by day 7. Strong virus neutralizing activity was observed on day 14 in rabbits immunized with the S1 Fc fusion protein using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Most importantly, in less than 20 days and three injections of the S1 Fc fusion protein, two monkeys developed higher virus neutralizing titers than a recovered COVID 19 patient in a live SARS CoV 2 infection assay. Our data strongly suggests that the CHO expressed SARS CoV 2 S1 Fc recombinant protein could be a strong candidate for vaccine development against COVID 19.	1
2817	"A novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2, also called novel coronavirus 2019 , started to circulate among humans around December 2019, and it is now widespread as a global pandemic.
The disease caused by SARS CoV 2 virus is called COVID 19, which is highly contagious and has an overall mortality rate of 6.4% as of April 15, 2020. There is no vaccine or antiviral available for SARS CoV 2. In this study, we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the SARS CoV 2 main protease (M pro ). Using the FRET based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC 376, calpain inhibitors II, XII, and MG 132 were identified to have potent activity with single digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies and thermal shift binding assays. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC 376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS CoV 2 viral replication in cell culture with EC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 µM. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known M pro inhibitors. Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS CoV 2
therapeutics.
An emerging respiratory disease COVID 19 started to circulate among human in December 2019. Since its first outbreak in China from an unknown origin, it quickly became a global pandemic. As of April 15, 2020, there are 123,010 deaths among 1,914,916 confirmed cases in 213 countries. 1 The etiological pathogen of COVID 19 is a new coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2), also called novel coronavirus (nCoV 2019).
As the name indicates, SARS CoV 2 is similar to SARS, the virus that causes severe respiratory symptoms in human and killed 774 people among 8098 infected worldwide in 2003. 2 SARS CoV 2 shares ~82% of sequence identity as SARS and to a less extent for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (~50%). 3,4 SARS CoV 2 is an enveloped, positive sense, singlestranded RNA virus that belongs to the β lineage of the coronavirus. 5 The β lineage also contains two other important human pathogens, the SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus. The mortality rate of SARS CoV 2 is around 6.4% as of April 15, 2020, which is lower than that of SARS (~10%) and MERS (~34%). 2 However, current data indicate that SARS CoV 2 is more contagious and has a larger R0 value than SARS and MERS, 6 resulting in higher overall death tolls than SARS and MERS. The SARS CoV 2 virus is currently spreading at an alarming speed in Europe and the United States.
There is currently no antiviral or vaccine for SARS CoV 2. The SARS CoV 2 viral genome encodes a number of structural proteins (e.g. capsid spike glycoprotein), non structural proteins (e.g. 3 chymotrypsin like protease (3CL or main protease), papain like protease, helicase, and RNA dependent RNA polymerase), and accessary proteins. Compounds that target anyone of these viral proteins might be potential antiviral drug candidates. In this study, we focus on the viral 3CL protease, also called the main protease (M pro ), and aim to develop potent M pro inhibitors as SAR CoV 2 antivirals. The M pro plays an essential role in coronavirus replication : bioRxiv preprint by digesting the viral polyproteins at more than 11 sites, and it appears like a high profile target for antiviral drug discovery. 7 9 The M pro has an unique substrate preference for glutamine at the P1 site (Leu Gln(Ser,Ala,Gly)), a feature that is absent in closely related host proteases, suggesting it is feasible to achieve high selectivity by targeting viral M pro . As such, we developed the Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) based enzymatic assay for the SARS CoV 2 M pro and applied it to screen a focused library of protease inhibitors. Here we report our findings of several hits targeting SARS CoV 2 M pro and their mechanism of action.
The in vitro antiviral activity of the hits was also evaluated in cell culture using infectious SARS CoV 2 virus. Overall, our study provides a list of drug candidates for SARS CoV 2 with a confirmed mechanism of action, and the results might help speed up the drug discovery efforts in combating COVID 19. The compounds identified herein represent the most potent and selective SARS CoV 2 M pro inhibitors so far with both enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity. 7,9
Results
The M pro gene from SARS CoV 2 strain BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 was inserted into pET 29a( ) vector and expressed in BL21(DE3) E. Coli. with a His tag in its C terminus. The M pro protein was purified with Ni NTA column to high purity (Fig. 1A) . To establish the FRET assay condition, we designed a FRET based substrate using the sequence between viral polypeptide NSP4 NSP5 junction from SARS CoV 2: Dabcyl KTSAVLQ/SGFRKME(Edans). We then tested the M pro proteolytic activity in buffers with different pH. We found that M pro displays highest activity in pH 6.5 buffer (Fig. 1B) , which contains 20 mM HEPES, 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA,"	0

2819	In this paper, a novel approach called GSA DenseNet121 COVID 19 based on a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed using an optimization algorithm. The CNN architecture that was used is called DenseNet121 and the optimization algorithm that was used is called the gravitational search algorithm (GSA). The GSA is adapted to determine the best values for the hyperparameters of the DenseNet121 architecture, and to achieve a high level of accuracy in diagnosing COVID 19 disease through chest x ray image analysis. The obtained results showed that the proposed approach was able to correctly classify 98% of the test set. To test the efficacy of the GSA in setting the optimum values for the hyperparameters of DenseNet121, it was compared to another optimization algorithm called social ski driver (SSD). The comparison results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed GSA DenseNet121 COVID 19 and its ability to better diagnose COVID 19 disease than the SSD DenseNet121 as the second was able to diagnose only 94% of the test set. As well as, the proposed approach was compared to an approach based on a CNN architecture called Inception v3 and the manual search method for determining the values of the hyperparameters. The results of the comparison showed that the GSA DenseNet121 was able to beat the other approach, as the samples.	0

2821	"Cases of COVID 19 are escalating rapidly across the globe, with the mortality risk being especially high among those with existing illness and multimorbidity. This study aimed to synthesise evidence for the role and response of palliative care and hospice teams to viral epi/pandemics, to inform the COVID 19 pandemic response.
We conducted a rapid systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines in five databases. Of 3094 papers identified, ten were included in this narrative synthesis.
Included studies were from West Africa, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United States and Italy. All had an observational design. Findings were synthesised using a previously proposed framework according to 'systems' (policies, training and protocols, communication and coordination, data), 'staff' (deployment, skill mix, resilience), 'space' (community provision, use of technology) and 'stuff' (medicines and equipment, personal protective equipment). We conclude that hospice and palliative services have an essential role in the response to COVID 19 by: 1) responding rapidly and flexibly; 2) ensuring protocols for symptom management are available, and training non specialists in their use; 3) being involved in triage; 4) considering shifting resources into the community; 5) considering redeploying volunteers to provide psychosocial and bereavement care; 6) facilitating camaraderie among staff and adopt measures to deal with stress; 7) using technology to communicate with patients and carers; 8) adopting standardised data collection systems to inform operational changes and improve care.
An evidence synthesis on the role and response of hospice and palliative care in epi/pandemics, to inform response to COVID 19. Hospice and palliative care services should: respond rapidly and flexibly; produce protocols; shift resources to the community; redeploy volunteers; facilitate staff camaraderie; communicate with patients/carers via technology; standardise data collection."	0
2822	Therefore, the pathological results showed that SARS CoV were detected in alveolar type II epithelial cells, monocytes, digestive tract epithelial cells, distal renal tubulesepithelial cells, skin sweat gland cells, parathyroid and pituitary eosinophils, adrenal cortex cells, gastric parietal cells, pancreatic acinar cells and tracheal serous gland cells. The citric acid concentration before the filter should reach 3 to 4 mmol/L, the free calcium after the filter should be maintained at 0.25 ~ 0.35 mmol/L and the venous free calcium should be at 1.1 ~ 1.35 mmol/L. The citric acid dose should be adjusted depending on the concentration of the ionized calcium concentration after the filter, and the calcium chloride or calcium gluconate solution dose should be [28].	0
2823	"The influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (H1N1) pandemic had a significant impact on the blood supply due to donors’ fear of exposure to the virus at a hospital or a free standing donor facility.3,4 Similarly, the COVID 19 pandemic has already led to significantly reduced blood supplies due to the cancellation of numerous community based and mobile blood drives, as well as a marked reduction in donors arriving for scheduled appointments. In the absence of nucleic acid testing (NAT) for blood donor screening for SARS CoV 2, we cannot exclude, albeit theoretical at this time, the possible transmission via a blood transfusion, if some of the donated blood may be contaminated.7 Thus, we are facing significant unknowns, and only future studies will elucidate the true risks of transfusion transmitted SARS CoV 2 if any.8
For all of the above reasons, the medical community must adopt other solutions to continue and/or resume care of our patient population. Point of care viscoelastic testing, including thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry, facilitates near real time identification of coagulation abnormalities, thereby allowing rapid and targeted correction of the impaired pathway, rather than relying on unguided administration of plasma and platelets.84,85

2825	"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic is leading to social (physical) distancing policies worldwide, including in the USA. Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health care labour force. The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health care worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child care obligations for US health care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases.
Methods For this modelling analysis, we used data from the monthly releases of the US Current Population Survey to characterise the family structure and probable within household child care options of US health care workers. We accounted for the occupation within the health care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health care workforce that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID 19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. , the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 3·1 million individuals across 1·3 million households. We found that the US health care sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the USA, with 28·8% (95% CI 28·5 29·1) of the health care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3 12 years. Assuming non working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 15·0% (14·8 15·2) of the health care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID 19 such as a 15·0% case reduction from school closings and 2·0% baseline mortality rate, a 15·0% decrease in the health care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health care worker lost by 17·6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. Our model estimates that if the infection mortality rate of COVID 19 increases from 2·00% to 2·35% when the health care workforce declines by 15·0%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent.
Interpretation School closures come with many trade offs, and can create unintended child care obligations. Our results suggest that the potential contagion prevention from school closures needs to be carefully weighted with the potential loss of health care workers from the standpoint of reducing cumulative mortality due to COVID 19, in the absence of mitigating measures.

We tracked the data until March 5, 2020. The cases in our cohort were divided into cases only received noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and cases required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The characteristics between the two groups were compared.
Results: 34 cases were included in the study. The complications rate (including, acute liver injury, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury) were higher in IMV cases. Lymphocytopenia and neutrophilia occurred in most cases in both groups on the admission day, however, lymphocyte levels dropped progressively and more severe lymphopenia occurred in IMV group. Increased amounts of plasma IL 6 and IL 10 were found in both groups on the admission day, the progressive decrease of which occurred in NIV cases rather than IMV cases, and the levels were higher in IMV cases during hospitalization.
Conclusions: Lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia, and increase of IL 6 and IL 10 occurred in SARS CoV 2 infected patients in ICU, however, the dynamics of those were significantly different in IMV cases and NIV cases during hospitalization."	1
2828	The CRISPR/Cas12a RNA guided complexes have a tremendous potential for nucleic acid detection due to its ability to indiscriminately cleave ssDNA once bound to a target DNA. However, the current CRISPR/Cas12a systems are limited to detecting DNA in a picomolar detection limit without an amplification step. Here, we developed a platform with engineered crRNAs and optimized conditions that enabled us to detect DNA, DNA/RNA heteroduplex and methylated DNA with higher sensitivity, achieving a limit of detection of in femtomolar range without any target pre amplification step. By extending the 3' or 5' ends of the crRNA with different lengths of ssDNA, ssRNA, and phosphorothioate ssDNA, we discovered a new selfcatalytic behavior and an augmented rate of LbCas12a mediated collateral cleavage activity as high as 3.5 fold compared to the wild type crRNA. We applied this sensitive system to detect as low as 25 fM dsDNA from the PCA3 gene, an overexpressed biomarker in prostate cancer patients, in simulated urine over 6 hours. The same platform was used to detect as low as ~700 fM cDNA from HIV, 290 fM RNA from HCV, and 370 fM cDNA from SARS CoV 2, all within 30 minutes without a need for target amplification. With isothermal amplification of SARS CoV 2 RNA using RT LAMP, the modified crRNAs were incorporated in a paper based lateral flow assay that could detect the target with up to 23 fold higher sensitivity within 40 60 minutes.	0
2829	"We present a method for efficient estimation of the prevalence of infection in a population with high accuracy using only a small number of tests. The presented approach uses pool testing with a mix of pool sizes of various sizes. The test results are then combined to generate an accurate estimation over a wide range of infection probabilities. This method does not require an initial guess on the infection probability. We show that, using the suggested method, even a set of only 50 tests with a total of only 1000 samples can produce reasonable estimation over a wide range of probabilities. A measurement set with only 100 tests is shown to achieve 25% accuracy over infection probabilities from 0.001 to 0.5.

2831	The ongoing pandemic of 2019 nCov (COVID 19) coronavirus has made reliable epidemiological modeling an urgent necessity. Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine grained to be efficient or too coarse grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.	0

2838	Cytokine storms are drivers of pathology and mortality in myriad viral infections affecting the human population. In SARS CoV 2 infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID 19 remains to be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti viral immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged with viral mimetics that activate Toll like receptor signaling and IFN anti viral responses, these animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1 specific inhibitor. Therefore, these results point to JAK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses. Additionally, these results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the IFNR gene cluster encoded on chromosome pandemic.	0

2845	Background: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China. This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created.	0

2847	Background. Epidemiological figures of Covid 19 epidemic in Italy are worse than those observed in China. Methods. We modeled the Covid 19 outbreak in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemics progression and predict peaks of new daily infections and total cases by learning from the entire Chinese epidemiological dynamics. We trained an artificial neural network model, a modified autoencoder with Covid 19 Chinese data, to forecast epidemic curve of the different Italian regions, and use the susceptible exposed infected removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading and peaks. We have estimated the basic reproduction number (R 0 )  which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection  both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1 month period, and also by using a day by day assessment, based on single observations. Results. The expected peak of SEIR model for new daily cases was at the end of March at national level. The peak of overall positive cases is expected by April 11 th in Southern Italian Regions, a couple of days after that of Lombardy and Northern regions. According to our model, total confirmed cases in all Italy regions could reach 160,000 cases by April 30 th and stabilize at a plateau. Conclusions. Training neural networks on Chinese data and use the knowledge to forecast Italian spreading of Covid 19 has resulted in a good fit, measured forecast.	0

Este proceso es un cuadro inflamatorio, protagonizado por una cascada de citocinas bajo el amparo del INFLAMOSOMA NLRP3, responsable principal de la destrucción alveolar. De entre todas las citocinas que se desencadenan en este cuadro destaca la IL beta. ANAKINRA es un potente fármaco biológico, capaz de bloquear esta IL 1 beta.

2850	In this paper, we propose a new real time differential virus transmission model, which can give more accurate and robust short term predictions of COVID 19 transmitted infectious disease with benefits of near term projection. Different from the existing Susceptible Exposed Infected Removed (SEIR) based virus transmission models, which fits well for pandemic modeling with sufficient historical data, the new model, which is also SEIR based, uses short history data to find the trend of the changing disease dynamics for the infected, the dead and the recovered so that it can naturally accommodate the adaptive realtime changes of disease mitigation, business activity and social behavior of populations. Our work is inspired by the observation that contagious disease transmission prediction is similar to weather prediction: only short term prediction is typically accurate due to many time varying interplaying factors as well as social and behavior uncertainties involved. On the other hand, accurate shortterm prediction such as one week or ten days can give local government and hospical decision makers sufficient lead time for healthcare resources and critical personnel planning to provide in patient treatment. As the parameters of the improved SEIR models are trained by short history window data for accurate trend prediction, our differential epidemic model, essentially are window based time varying SEIR model. Since SEIR model still is a physics based disease transmission model, its near term (like one month) projection can still be very instrumental for policy makers to guide their decision for disease mitigation and business activity policy changes in a real time. This is especially useful if the pandemic lasts more than one year with different phases across the world like 1918 flu pandemic. Numerical results on the recent COVID 19 data from China, Italy and US, California and New York states have been analyzed. Based on the projection as of April 13, 2020 from the proposed model, the time for peak medical resource usage for US as a whole will be around the beginning of May. Also US will reach the peak in terms of daily new infected cases and death cases around middle of April. The total cumulative infected cases will reach to peak of 1.09 million people around June 12, 2020 and the estimated total death cases will reach to 90K in the end.	0
2851	Objectives: In late December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease in Wuhan, China was caused by a novel coronavirus, newly named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We aimed to quantify the severity of COVID 19 infection on high resolution chest computed tomography (CT) and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. Materials and Methods: From January 11, 2020, to February 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory, and high resolution CT features of 42 patients (26 75 years, 25 males) with COVID 19 were analyzed. The initial and follow up CT, obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features, and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. Results: Thirty five patients (83%) exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips, and air bronchograms, compared with initial CT (all P < 0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R = 0.68, P < 0.01). The C reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (R range , 0.36 0.75; P < 0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow up CT (P = 0.001 0.04). Conclusions: Patients with the COVID 19 infection usually presented with typical ground glass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements. Follow up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early stage from illness onset.	0
2852	"which shares a similar genome sequence with the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). 1,2 Like SARS CoV, reports demonstrate that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) could act as the receptor for 2019 nCoV. 1,3 Moreover, studies have shown that 2019 nCoV binds ACE2 with a higher affinity than the original SARS virus strain. 4
Renin angiotensin system (RAS) activity regulates the human homeostatic state, and is intrinsically high in the lungs, which is rich in ACE and ACE2 and therefore a major site of systemic angiotensin II synthesis. 5 ACE2 functions in the RAS as a carboxypeptidase, cleaving angiotensin I to generate angiotensin 1 9, and cleaving angiotensin II to generate angiotensin 1 7. 6,7 Pulmonary ACE2 appears to play a role in regulating the balance of circulating angiotensin II/angiotensin 1 7 levels. When responding to hypoxia, angiotensin II induces pulmonary vasoconstriction to prevent shunting in patients with pneumonia or lung injury; nevertheless, the increased production of angiotensin II in the lungs under hypoxia also enhances pulmonary vascular permeability and accelerates subsequent pulmonary edema. 5 In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the RAS also plays a major role in maintaining oxygenation. According to ARDS animal models, ACE2 knockout mice presented more severe symptoms compared with wildtype mice, supporting the view that overexpression of ACE2 appears protective. 8 ACE2 is a crucial receptor for SARS CoV and 2019 nCoV, and binding to ACE2 by CoV spike protein downregulates ACE2 expression. The loss of ACE2 expression results in severe acute respiratory failure. 9,10 AT1 receptor (AT1R) mediates angiotensin II induced vascular permeability and severe acute lung injury. Therefore, CoV spikemediated lung failure is suspected of being rescued by inhibition of AT1R from a RAS blockade, such as angiotensin II receptor block or angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor. 9,11 On the other hand, blockade of AT1R, with consequent elevation of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II, stimulates ACE2 activity. 6,11 A dilemma is that the RAS blockade could attenuate the severe lung injury induced by CoV infection via inhibition of AT1R, but also increase ACE2 expression and therefore provide more targets for virus binding and replicating. Taking both into account, we hypothesized that a higher level blockade of RAS might resolve this dilemma. The optimal choice may be the direct renin inhibitor, which could decrease the original renin activity and, consequently, lower angiotensin I and II. 10 ACE2 expression would decrease because of low angiotensin I and II activity. Less ACE2 expression may prevent the body being attacked by 2019 nCoV because of fewer targets for the virus, while the AT1R is still inhibited by low renin activity, with adequate lung protection regardless of low ACE2 expression.
For data reported on 2 March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO), globally registered COVID 19 cases were 88,948, of which there were 80,174 cases in China, and other cases had spread to 64 countries reporting a total of 2069 cases. Very surprisingly, Africa had confirmed only two cases. According to the epidemiology, we also speculate whether the low infection rate in Africa is associated with the essentially low renin activity in the population of Africa. 12 As we know, the RAS blockade was less effective for hypertension control in the population of Africa Does the direct renin inhibitor have a role to play in attenuating severity of the outbreak coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19)?"	0
2853	An automated statistical and error analysis of 45 countries or regions with more than 1000 cases of COVID 19 as of March 28, 2020, has been performed. This study reveals differences in the rate that most countries undergo a beginning exponential growth phase, which transitions into a power law phase, as recently suggested by Ziff and Ziff. Tracking indicators of growth, such as the power law exponent, are a good indication of the relative danger different countries are in and show when social measures are effective towards slowing the spread. The data compiled here are usefully synthesizing a global picture, identifying country to country variation in spreading, and identifying countries most at risk. This analysis may factor into how best to track the effectiveness of social distancing policies and quarantines in real time as data is updated each day.	1
2854	Journal Pre proof J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f Abstract A COVID 19 outbreak emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and developed into a global pandemic during March 2020. The effects of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID 19 epidemic in China are unknown. Data on COVID 19 daily confirmed cases and daily mean temperatures were collected from 31 provincial level regions in mainland China between Jan 20 and Feb 29, 2020. Locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS), distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), and random effects meta analysis were used to examine the relationship between daily confirmed cases rate of COVID 19 and temperature conditions. The daily number of new cases peaked on Feb 12, and then decreased. The daily confirmed cases rate of COVID 19 had a biphasic relationship with temperature (with a peak at 10 ℃), and the daily incidence of COVID 19 decreased at values below and above these values. The overall epidemic intensity of COVID 19 reduced slightly following days with higher temperatures with a relative risk (RR) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). A random effect meta analysis including 28 provinces in mainland China, we confirmed the statistically significant association between temperature and RR during the study period (Coefficient =  0.0100, 95% CI:  0.0125,  0.0074). The DLNMs in Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan showed similar patterns of temperature. Additionally, a modified susceptible exposed infectious recovered (M SEIR) model, with adjustment for climatic factors, was used to provide a complete characterization of the impact of climate on the dynamics of the COVID 19 epidemic.

2855	"A new coronavirus, SARS CoV 2, has recently emerged to cause a human pandemic.
Whereas molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet urgently needed. Validated serologic assays are important for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir and epidemiological studies. Here, we developed serological assays for the detection of SARS CoV 2 neutralizing, spike and nucleocapsid specific antibodies. Using serum samples from patients with PCR confirmed infections of SARS CoV 2, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrate that most PCRconfirmed SARS CoV 2 infected individuals seroconverted, as revealed by sensitive and specific in house ELISAs. We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity while sensitivity varied between the two, with IgA showing higher sensitivity. Overall, the validated assays described here can be instrumental for the detection of SARS CoV 2 specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiological and vaccine evaluation studies.

2856	"we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study among pupils, their parents and siblings, as well as teachers and non teaching staff of a high school located in Oise. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered history of fever and/or respiratory symptoms since 13 January 2020 and had blood tested for the presence of anti SARS CoV 2 antibodies. The infection attack rate (IAR) was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection based on antibody detection. Blood samples from two blood donor centres collected between 23 and 27 March 2020 in the Oise department were also tested for presence of anti SARS CoV 2 antibodies.
Findings: Of the 661 participants (median age: 37 years), 171 participants had anti SARS CoV 2 antibodies. The overall IAR was 25.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 22.6 29.4), and the infection fatality rate was 0% (one sided 97.5% CI = 0  2.1). Nine of the ten participants hospitalised since mid January were in the infected group, giving a hospitalisation rate of 5.3% (95% CI = 2.4  9.8). Anosmia and ageusia had high positive predictive values for SARS CoV 2 infection (84.7% and 88.1%, respectively). Smokers had a lower IAR compared to non smokers (7.2% versus 28.0%, P <0.001). The proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0% (95% CI = 11.2  23.4). The proportion of donors with anti SARS CoV 2 antibodies in two nearby blood banks of the Oise department was 3.0% (95% CI = 1.1  6.4).
The relatively low IAR observed in an area where SARS CoV 2 actively circulated weeks before confinement measures indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time, and that lifting these measures in France will be long and complex."	0

S8 Evolutionary trees in microbiology B. Hall (Bellingham, US) Phylogenetic trees are just tools for representing the relationships among organisms. The focus of this presentation is on the interpretation of phylogenetic trees, rather than on construction of those trees. Elements that will be considered are: what are branches and nodes and what do they mean? Trees are typically drawn so that they appear to depict the order of descent from common ancestors, i.e. the direction of evolution. That appearance is often misleading. Direction of evolution and order of descent are only shown by rooted trees, whereas most phylogenetic methods produce unrooted trees. What information is required to root a tree? Trees of microbial isolates often include zero length branches. What do zero length branches really mean? Trees are only estimates of historical relationships they are not facts. How do we determine the reliability of those estimated trees? Recombination can dramatically affect the validity of phylogenetic trees. What do we do when there is too much recombination to construct valid phylogenetic trees?
Representations of strain similarities in molecular microbial typing P. Vauterin (Ghent, BE)
This talk covers a variety of grouping techniques that are used to represent the relations between strains using molecular typing data. For each technique, the strong and weak points are discussed, and guidelines are given to come to a reliable interpretation of the results. The emphasis is on traditional hierarchical cluster analysis tools, and we elaborate on the limits of their applicability. In particular, the loss of information introduced by cluster analysis is discussed, as well as the problem to degenerate solutions. The particular challenges associated with the analysis and interpretation of modern large data sets potentially include thousands of organisms, which are also covered. We also discuss novel grouping techniques, such as minimum spanning trees and self organizing maps, and show how these tools can be used complementary to traditional cluster analysis to gain further insight in the structure of the data.
Antibiotic susceptibility testing of clinically relevant anaerobes in different clinical microbiological laboratories in Europe is less and less frequently carried out due to the fact, that clinicians treat many presumed anaerobic infections empirically. Even less data are available about the antibiotic resistance levels among the anaerobic normal flora isolates developed due to the use of antibiotics for infections caused by aerobic or facultative anaerobic pathogens. New antibiotics with anti anaerobic activity may be tested on ""old"" isolates instead of using ""recent"" clinical isolates, which may create false susceptibility data and incorrect recommendations for treatment of anaerobic infections. Most systemic data in Europe are available for few genera and species of anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis and related species, Fusobacterium spp., Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. Two Europewide resistance studies were carried out during the past 15 years involving almost all European countries evaluating the development of resistance among B. fragilis and related species. A similar study was done with clinical isolates of Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococci. Expressed differences were found in resistance levels between different Bacteroides species and between different areas of Europe for clindamycin, erythromycin, ampicillin and moxifloxacin. The same is true for Propionibacterium acnes. Resistance genes responsible for carbapenem and nitro imidazole resistance can be found more frequently among clinical and normal flora isolates, than the expressed resistance. Despite of the fact that most anti anaerobic drugs show good activity against anaerobic clinical isolates, the number of the resistant isolates is increasing parallel with the time. Accumulation of resistance markers can be observed among Bacteroides strains. Reported cases will be discussed where clinical failure was due to the presence of multi resistant anaerobic pathogens.
S12 Infections associated with intravascular devices
Notwithstanding the progress in our understanding of the pathogenesis of foreign body infection, catheter related infection (CRI) continues to be part of the daily life in the ICU, oncology or haematology unit. The consequential morbidity and longer hospital stay brings about considerable costs. However, several interventions can reduce the incidence of CRI. 10 years ago, catheters coated or impregnated with antiseptics or antibiotics became part of our armament against CRI. However, indiscriminate prophylactic use of antibiotics increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore the minocyclin rifampin impregnated catheter (the only antibiotic impregnated catheter with well documented efficacy) is not available in Europe. A catheter impregnated with chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine (CS) on the outer surface is available in Europe and has been shown to have the incidence of CRI. Two recent clinical studies show that an improved version of this catheter (with CS on the inner and outer surface) reduces catheter colonization with 45 72%. In vitro evidence about the use of antiseptic agents as a substitute for antibiotic locks for the prevention of endoluminal CRI is available. However, evidence from prospective randomized controlled clinical trials on the use of antiseptic locks is still scarce. Several clinical studies and a meta analysis support the use of chlorhexidine as the preferred disinfectant prior to catheter insertion. Recent evidence supports the use of a chlorhexidine impregnated sponge that is placed around the insertion site of the catheter to prevent recolonization of the insertion site and therefore also exoluminal CRI of short term central venous as well as arterial catheters. In general it is correct to state that microorganisms on the outer surface of the catheter (exoluminal) are the source of infection in most of the CRI in short term catheters and microorganisms on the inner surface (endoluminal) become more important with longer duration of catheter use. This difference is however gradual. Therefore in most settings interventions directed against exoluminal as well as endoluminal CRI should be combined. Despite the abovementioned new developments, the implementation of a structured teaching program on CRI (with a special emphasis on the adherence to full sterile barrier precautions, chlorhexidine based skin disinfections and removal of the catheter as soon as possible) remains the cornerstone of CRI prevention."	0
2859	At the time of this writing, in Taiwan, 267 people (227 imported and 40 indigenous cases) are infected with this severe acute respiratory syndrome and 2 people have died.1 The entire country is bracing not only for the public health challenges posed by the outbreak that respects no boundaries, but also for the social, economic and political ramifications. To be sure, governments worldwide have adopted a wide range of regulatory measures,17 such as social distancing and stay home orders,18 mass testing,19 contact tracing and surveillance,20 the shuttering of non essential services21 and even border closures and national shutdowns.22 The legality and legitimacy of such regulatory actions may be examined pursuant to different norms and standards underlying a country’s respective political system, legal tradition and social context. Taiwan has fought a long battle with fake news (China is the primary origin) since 2012 and has modernised its legislative and regulatory responses.43 Citing the CDC Act and the Social Order Maintenance Act (SOM Act), the government has fined or even arrested individuals for spreading rumours regarding COVID 19 and the shortage of household necessities.44 These measures may seem well intentioned and make some sense in theory, but they may lack the scope of sensitivity regarding what is at stake. Furthermore, while the CDC Act71 and the COVID 19 Special Act72 authorise the government to impose quarantine, isolation care and “other necessary measures”, it remains debatable whether linking multiple national databases, disclosing names, collecting mobile data and analysing surveillance data qualify as principles.	0

This paper reviews the impact of infections on the onset and clinical course of bronchial asthma. A just emphasis is given to the role viral infections, particularly rhinovirus infections, play in exacerbations, and that played by respiratory syncytial virus, suspected of triggering the asthmatic syndrome. The mechanisms of the immune response to virus attacks are explained, highlighting the asthmatic and allergic patient's weakened response, particularly in the perinatal period. Further stressed is a potentiating effect of viral aggression on the allergic response. The hygiene hypothesis and its lack of scientific consistency is detailed, at least as far as the role it seeks to confer on an unproven antagonism of the Th 1 and Th 2 lymphocyte responses. The current importance of research not into bacteria, but into bacterial products, including endotoxins, on the modulation of asthma and allergy is noted.

2864	Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak started in December 2019 that caused difficulties for clinical work. Practical work experience in our spinal outpatient and emergency department during the COVID 19 pandemic is summarized in this article, with combined evidence based medical evidence to explore diagnosis and treatment for spinal diseases. Outpatient reservation, continuous screening, triage, and isolation, first consultation accountability system, pandemic reporting system, and online revisit were strictly followed. We hope that our experience in prevention and control of COVID 19 can help spine surgeons globally in stopping the spread of COVID 19. Spine surgeons should collaborate with infection control specialists to avoid cross infection in hospitals and optimize treatment.	1
2865	"A recently developing pneumonia caused by SARS CoV 2 was originated in Wuhan, China, and has quickly spread across the world. We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID 19 in a single center.
Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory confirmed as SARS CoV 2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital's electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms.
Results: All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio of >5 (94.5%), high systemic immune inflammation index of >500 (89.2%), increased C reactive protein level (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D dimer (97.1%).

2867	At early stages of the COVID 19 pandemic which we are experiencing, the publicly reported incidence, mortality and case fatality rates (CFR) vary significantly between countries. Here we aim to untangle factors that are associated with the differences during the first quarter of the year 2020. Number of performed COVID 19 tests has a strong correlation with country specific incidence (p < 2 × 10  16 ) and mortality rate (p = 5.1 × 10  8 ). Using multivariate linear regression we show that incidence and mortality rates correlate significantly with GDP per capita (p = 2.6 × 10  15 and 7.0 × 10  4 , respectively), country specific duration of the outbreak (2.6 × 10  4 and 0.0019), fraction of citizens over 65 years old (p = 0.0049 and 3.8 × 10  4 ) and level of press freedom (p = 0.021 and 0.019) which cumulatively explain 80% of variability of incidence and more than 60% of variability of mortality of the disease during the period analyzed. Country hemisphere demonstrated significant correlation only with mortality (p = 0.17 and 0.036) whereas population density (p = 0.94 and p = 0.75) and latitude (p = 0.61 and 0.059) did not reach significance in our model. Case fatality rate is shown to rise as the outbreak progresses (p=0.028). We rank countries by COVID 19 mortality corrected for incidence and the factors that were shown to affect it, and by CFR corrected for outbreak duration, yielding very similar results. Among the countries where the outbreak started after the 15th of February and with at least 1000 registered patients during the period analyzed, the lowest corrected CFR are seen in Israel, South Africa and Chile. The ranking results should be considered with caution as they do not consider all confounding factors or data reporting biases.	0

2869	"Background: The novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) has rapidly evolved into a global epidemic. To control its spread, countries have implemented non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as school or border closures, while others have even enforced complete lockdowns. Here we study the impact of NPIs in reducing documented cases of COVID 19. Documented case numbers are selected because they are essential for decision makers in the area of health policy when monitoring and evaluating current control mechanisms.
Methods: We empirically estimate the relative reduction in the number of new cases attributed to each NPI. A cross country analysis is performed using documented cases through April 15, 2020 from n = 20 countries (i.e., the United States, Canada, Australia, the EU 15 countries, Norway, and Switzerland).
Results: As of April 15, venue closures were associated with a reduction in the number of new cases by 36 % (95% credible interval [CrI] 20 48 %), closely followed by gathering bans (34 %; 95% CrI 21 45 %), border closures (31 %; 95% CrI 19 42 %), and work bans on non essential business activities (31 %; 95% CrI 16 44 %). Event bans lead to a slightly less pronounced reduction (23 %; 95% CrI 8 35 %).

2870	Human coronaviruses SARS CoV 2 appeared at the end of 2019 and led to a pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. As there are currently no effective drugs targeting this virus, drug repurposing represents a short term strategy to treat millions of infected patients at low costs. Hydroxychloroquine showed an antiviral effect in vitro. In vivo it showed efficacy, especially when combined with azithromycin in a preliminary clinical trial. Here we demonstrate that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has a synergistic effect in vitro on SARS CoV 2 at concentrations compatible with that obtained in human lung.	1

2872	"The prevalence of SARS CoV 2 infection was 7.3% in healthcare workers and 0.4% in nonhealthcare workers, representing 7.0% greater absolute risk in the former (95% confidence interval for risk difference 4.7%, 9.3%). Infections were most common among nursing staff.
Meaning: Health care workers, particularly those with high levels of close patient contact, may be particularly vulnerable to SARS CoV 2 infection. Additional strategies are needed to protect these critical frontline workers.
Importance: Healthcare workers are presumed to be at increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) infection due to occupational exposure to infected patients. However, no epidemiological study has examined the prevalence of SARS CoV 2 infection in a cohort of healthcare workers during the early phase of community transmission.
Objective: To determine the baseline prevalence of SARS CoV 2 infection in a cohort of previously undiagnosed healthcare workers and a comparison group of non healthcare workers.
Setting: A large U.S. university and two affiliated university hospitals Participants: 546 health care workers and 283 non health care workers with no known prior SARS CoV 2 infection Exposure: Healthcare worker status and role Main outcome(s) and measure(s): SARS CoV 2 infection status as determined by presence of SARS CoV 2 RNA in oropharyngeal swabs.
Results: At baseline, 41 (5.0%) of participants tested positive for SARS CoV 2 infection, of whom 14 (34.2%) reported symptoms. The prevalence of SARS CoV 2 infection was higher among healthcare workers (7.3%) than in non healthcare workers (0.4%), representing a 7.0% greater absolute risk (95% confidence interval for risk difference 4.7%, 9.3%). The majority of infected healthcare workers (62.5%) worked as nurses. Positive tests increased across the two weeks of cohort recruitment in line with rising confirmed cases in the hospitals and surrounding counties.
In a prospective cohort conducted in the early phases of community transmission, healthcare workers had a higher prevalence of SARS CoV 2 infection than non healthcare workers, attesting to the occupational hazards of caring for patients in this crisis. Baseline data reported here will enable us to monitor the spread of infection and examine risk factors for transmission among healthcare workers. These results will inform optimal strategies for protecting the healthcare workforce, their families, and their patients.

2873	A model based on chaotic maps and turbulent flows is applied to the spread of Coronavirus for each Italian region in order to obtain useful information and help to contrast it. We divide the regions into different risk categories and discuss anomalies. The worst cases are confined between the Appenine and the Alps mountain ranges but the situation seem to improve closer to the sea. The Veneto region gave the most efficient response so far and some of their resources could be diverted to other regions, in particular more tests to the Lombardia, Liguria, Piemonte, Marche and V. Aosta regions, which seem to be worst affected. We noticed worrying anomalies in the Lazio, Campania and Sicilia regions to be monitored. We stress that the number of fatalities we predicted on March 12 has been confirmed daily by the bulletins. This suggests a change of strategy in order to reduce such number maybe moving the weaker population (and negative to the virus test) to beach resorts, which should be empty presently. The ratio deceased/positives on April 4, 2020 is 5.4% worldwide, 12.3% in Italy, 1.4% in Germany, 2.7% in the USA, 10.3% in the UK and 4.1% in China. These large fluctuations should be investigated starting from the Italian regions, which show similar large fluctuations.	0

2876	"Simple Summary: Most of the newly emerging infections arise from animal reservoirs, frequently represented by wildlife species. Western European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are mammalian hibernators, mainly nocturnal and insectivorous, living in natural open and green spaces as well as artificial, rural and urban, areas. They are generalist predators of macro invertebrates, but they may also eat meat, bird eggs and on occasion pet food. These ecological and feeding habits, along with their high population densities, notable synanthropic attitudes, frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species, including humans, implicate the possibility of intra and interspecies interactions accounting for the possible involvement of E. europaeus in the ecology of several potentially emerging pathogens, including coronaviruses. Using PCR based and virus isolation methods, we found that 58.3% of 24 hedgehogs' fecal samples were PCR positive for Erinaceus coronaviruses (EriCoVs). We did not observe any clinical disease related to the EriCoV infection in hedgehogs. However, the high mutation rates characterizing members of the Coronaviridae family and their potential successful interspecies host jumps as that likely occurred in the Novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) emergence should be considered in the management of hedgehogs admitted to multi species wildlife rehabilitation centers, recommending their return back to the original recovery areas.
Abstract: The Western European Hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is one of the four hedgehog species belonging to the genus Erinaceus. Among them, E. amurensis is extant in East Asia's areas only, whereas E. europaeus, E. roumanicus and E. concolor are mainly found in Europe. E. europaeus is endemically distributed from western to central and southern Europe, including Italy. Western European hedgehogs' ecological and feeding habits, along with their high population densities, notable synanthropic attitudes, frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species, including humans, implicate the possible involvement of E. europaeus in the ecology of potentially emerging viruses, Animals 2020, 10, 407 2 of 10 such as coronaviruses, influenza A and influenza D viruses, canine distemper virus, pestiviruses and Aujeszky's disease virus. We examined 24 E. europaeus individuals found injured in urban and rural areas of Northern Italy. Of the 24 fecal samples collected and tested for the above mentioned pathogens by both PCR based and virus isolation methods, 14 were found PCR positive for betacoronaviruses belonging to lineage C and related to the known Erinaceus coronaviruses (EriCoVs), as determined by partial sequencing of the virus genome. Our findings suggest that hedgehogs could be considered natural reservoirs of CoVs, and also act as chronic shedding carriers of these potentially emerging RNA viruses."	0

2878	We are in the midst of a global viral pandemic, one with no cure and a high mortality rate. The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene complex plays a critical role in host immunity. We predicted HLA class I alleles from the transcriptome sequencing data prepared from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of five patients at the early stage of the COVID 19 outbreak. We identified the HLA I allele A*24:02 in four out of five patients, which is higher than the expected frequency (17.2%) in the South Han Chinese population.

2879	"COVID 19 is a critical public health priority. Non pharmaceutical intervention policies such as community quarantines, closures and travel bans are often implemented in emergencies but many of them are disruptive and difficult to maintain for extended periods of time. A promising alternative recommended by the CDC for influenza is requiring individuals showing fever symptoms to remain isolated at home until they are fever free for at least one day, but there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such symptom based isolation policies.
Here we introduce a computational model of symptom based isolation that accounts for the timing of symptoms, viral shedding and the population structure. It was validated on outbreaks of influenza in schools and modified to account for COVID 19. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the attack rates (the proportion of the population infected) under one or more days of fever based isolation.
Results: Using the model we find evidence that symptom based isolation policies could reduce the attack rates of both influenza and COVID 19 outbreaks, and flatten the outbreak curves.
Specifically, we found that across a range of influenza scenarios, a CDC recommended policy of one day isolation following fever can reduce the attack rate from 27% of the population to 12%, and to 3% if the isolation is extended to two days.

In both influenza and COVID 19, the policies are predicted to reduce the peak number of infected but not shorten the outbreak duration.
Conclusions : Symptom based isolation could be an important tool to control influenza and COVID 19 outbreaks in schools, and potentially other settings. We recommend that schools implement a post fever isolation policy of two days for influenza and six days for COVID 19."	0

2881	Due to the recent diffusion of COVID 19 outbreak, the scientific community is making efforts in analysing models for understanding the present situation and predicting future scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Susceptible Infected Exposed Recovered Dead (SEIRD) differential model [Weitz J. S. and Dushoff J., Scientific reports, 2015] for the analysis and forecast of the COVID 19 spread in Italian regions, using the data from the Italian Protezione Civile from February 24th 2020. In this study, we investigate an adaptation of SEIRD that takes into account the actual policies of the Italian government, consisting of modelling the infection rate as a time dependent function (SEIRD(rm)). Preliminary results on Lombardia and Emilia Romagna regions confirm that SEIRD(rm) fits the data more accurately than the original SEIRD model with constant rate infection parameter.

2883	Background: An ongoing epidemic of respiratory diseases caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID 2019, SARS CoV2) started in Wuhan, Hubei, in China at the end of December 2019. The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We decided to test them all for SARS Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decisionmakers. Methods: We investigated the presence of SARS CoV 19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS CoV 2 RNA was then carried out using several real time reverse transcription (RT) PCR assays. Results: We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS CoV2 were negative. By optimising the sampling process, sending samples sequentially and reducing the time scale for biological analysis, we were able to tests).	0
2884	"Introduction
Emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is a recent 51 pandemic and declared as a public health emergency by World Health Organization (WHO) 1 . 52 The disease rapidly spread across the globe and caused havoc to humanity 2 . By the end of 53 March, SARS CoV 2 had spread to 200 countries and infected over 4,50,000 people 3 . The 54 WHO is continuously monitoring and updating the health related plans to curtail the disease 55 spread. The absence of specific treatment and vaccine worsen the situation and threat the world. 56 International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), classified SARS CoV 2 57 under family coronaviridae of order nidovirales. The genomic sequence of SARS CoV 2 58 isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a patient from the Wuhan, China showed a 59 length of 29,903 nucleotides (GenBank accession number NC_045512) 4 . The SARS CoV 2 60 contains a positive single stranded RNA with 5ˊ and 3ˊ UTR. The genome codes for ORF1a, 61 ORF1b, Spike (S), ORF3a, ORF3b, Envelope (E), Membrane (M), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, 62

The S glycoprotein forms homotrimers and represents a potential target for therapeutic 64 and vaccine design as it mediates viral entry into host cells 6,7 . S glycoprotein comprises of two 65 functional subunits. Whereas the S1 subunit is responsible for binding to the host cell receptor, 66 the S2 subunit is responsible for the fusion of the viral with the cell membrane. Usually, in 67 CoVs, S is cleaved at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits, which remain non 68 covalently bound in the prefusion conformation, to activate the protein for membrane fusion 69 via extensive irreversible conformational changes 8 10 .

The FASTA 97 sequence of the targeted protein was used as an input for all the default parameters.
Identification of B cell epitopes 99 We used two web based tools for B cell epitope prediction, viz., the IEDB, and 100 ABCpred server 20 . S protein structure from protein data bank (PDB) (6VSB) 21 was analyzed 101 for linear and discontinuous B cell epitopes using ElliPro module 22 on IEDB server, with 102 default settings. Also, ABCpred server was used to detect B cell epitopes using artificial neural 103 network (ann) method. 104 Identification of T cell epitopes 105 T cell epitopes having binding affinity towards MHC I and MHC II alleles were 106 selected to boost up both cytotoxic T cell and helper T cell mediated immune response.

At the time of the study, there were 98 sequences 113 available for the targeted protein of SARS CoV 2. The S glycoprotein is 1273 amino acids 114 long sequence except for the virus isolated from Kerala (India), which is 1272 amino acids 115 long spike glycoprotein (GenBank accession number MT012098). Our interest here was to 116

We found that sequences among all the S 118 proteins in the analysis are least variable and highly conserved as shown in Figure 1 . Regions 119 having a high value of ASA are more surface exposed as compared to others. We identified a 120 total of 24 peptides of varying length, as shown in Table 1 , which are selected based on high 121 ASA values.

Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID 19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS CoV 2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health care personnel contacts were also tested.
Findings Patient 1 a woman in her 60s returned from China in mid January, 2020. 1 week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS CoV 2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but had frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested positive for SARS CoV 2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347 underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195 health care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under investigation, in addition to Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and all 32 asymptomatic health care personnel tested negative for SARS CoV 2.
Interpretation Person to person transmission of SARS CoV 2 occurred between two people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic. Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of symptomatic and some asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected.

2888	In the midst of epidemics such as COVID 19, therapeutic candidates are unlikely to be able to complete the usual multi year clinical trial and regulatory approval process within the course of an outbreak. We apply a Bayesian adaptive patient centered model which minimizes the expected harm of false positives and false negatives to optimize the clinical trial development path during such outbreaks. When the epidemic is more infectious and fatal, the Bayesian optimal sample size in the clinical trial is lower and the optimal statistical significance level is higher. For COVID 19 (assuming a static 2 and initial infection percentage of 0.1%), the optimal significance level is 7.1% for a clinical trial of a non vaccine anti infective therapeutic clinical trial and 13.6% for that of a vaccine. For a dynamic ranging from 2 to 4, the corresponding values are 14.4% and 26.4%, respectively. Our results illustrate the importance of adapting the clinical trial design and the regulatory approval process to the specific parameters and stage of the epidemic.	1

2890	Many pathogens take advantage of the dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulphate to regulate homeostasis and use heparan sulphate as a means to adhere and gain access to cells. Moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulphated. Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulphate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS CoV 2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS CoV 2 S1 RBD) and heparin. The data demonstrate an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain and the polysaccharide. This has implications for the rapid development of a first line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and for next generation, tailor made, GAG based antivirals.	0

Effective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor its spread and immune responses to it. However, little information is available about the targets of immune responses to SARS CoV 2. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses. This includes SARS CoV, which has high sequence similarity to SARS CoV 2 and is the best characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in SARS CoV 2 that have high homology to the SARS CoV virus. Parallel bioinformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for SARS CoV 2. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are promising targets for immune recognition of SARS CoV 2. These predictions can facilitate effective vaccine design against this virus of high priority."	0

S tudies of COPD that have used self report of possible COPD exacerbations detect one third to onehalf of all exacerbations that occur. 1 4 Participants using paper based data recording in studies of respiratory diseases often falsify data, 5,6 and the likelihood of this occurring increases with the length of the study. In one randomized trial of electronic symptom record ing vs monitored paper based recording, actual compliance was 94% in the electronic group, whereas fabricated compliance with paper based recording was 73%. 7 COPD exacerbations requiring hospital treatment are more frequent in winter. 8 10 Peaks in both COPD hospitalization and mortality occur in England at year end 11,12 and have been observed to be centered on the Christmas period in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Sweden. 12 In the Toward a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study, the highest rates of COPD exacerbations for northern hemisphere participants occurred in December, with the nexthighest in January. 13 Furthermore, children's presentations to general practitioners in England and Wales for acute bronchitis and hospitalization for respiratory diseases increase immediately before the Christmas period, 14 preceding peaks in adults. 14,15 Periods of school attendance and high levels of respiratory virus detection in children have been shown to coincide Background: Paper based diaries and self report of symptom worsening in COPD may lead to underdetection of exacerbations. Epidemiologically, COPD exacerbations exhibit seasonal patterns peaking at year end. We examined whether the use of a BlackBerry based daily symptom diary would detect 95% or more of exacerbations and enable characterization of seasonal differences among them.
December 2008. Participants transmitted daily symptom diaries using a BlackBerry. Alerts were triggered when symptom changes, missed diary transmissions, or medical care for a respiratory problem occurred. Participant encounters were initiated if COPD exacerbations were suspected. Participants used their BlackBerrys to report returns to normal breathing. Results: Participants transmitted 99.9% of 28,514 possible daily diaries. All 191 (2.5/participant year) COPD exacerbations meeting Anthonisen criteria were detected. During 148 of the 191 exacerbations (78%, 1.97/participant year), patients were hospitalized and/or ordered prednisone, an antibiotic, or both. Respiratory viruses were detected in 78 of the 191 exacerbations (41%). Those coinciding with a respiratory viral infection averaged 12.0 days, and those without averaged 8.9 days ( P , .04), with no difference in Anthonisen score. Respiratory symptom scores before exacerbations and after normal breathing return showed no differences. Exacerbations were more frequent during the Christmas period than the rest of the year but were not more frequent than in the rest of winter alone. Conclusions: Smartphone based collection of COPD symptom diaries enables near complete identifi cation of exacerbations at inception. Exacerbation rates in the Christmas season do not reach levels that necessitate changes in disease management. CHEST 2013; 144(2):507 514"	0
2894	At that time, we assumed the causative agent could have been one of eight known viral or three known bacterial pathogens, along with the chance that it was instead Disease X. We tracked two active medical social media sites (ProMED [9] and Flutracker [10]) that collected reports of the non virological characteristics of the outbreak as it progressed. Given these characteristics, we then calculated the probability that the ongoing outbreak was due to a known pathogen or unknown Disease X. On the first day of calculation (i.e., 30 December 2019)—the day that we became aware of the outbreak—the only explanatory factor we included was diagnosis of atypical pneumonia, which was common to all pathogens considered in our dataset. On 12 January 2020, the probability the outbreak was due to Disease X was estimated to be 82.2% and 56.5% according to the model considering all the characteristics (again, for the Hamming and Euclidean distances, respectively), while the model excluding the characteristic of exposure at the wet market suggested probabilities of 62.9% and 48.6%.	0

2898	Confirmed infection cases in mainland China were analyzed using the data up to January 28, 2020 (first 13 days of reliable confirmed cases). For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower than exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. As data become available, we subsequently analyzed them during three consecutive periods obtaining a sequence of model predictions. All available data up were processed the same way. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data. Using this model and the three sets of data, we estimated maximum cases as about 21,000, 28,000 and 35,000 cases refining these predictions in near real time. With slightly different approach (linearization in time) the estimate of maximum cases was even higher (about 65,000). Although the estimates of maximum cases increase as more data were reported all models show reaching a peak in mid February in contrast to the unconfined exponential growth. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection.	0
2899	"Successful containment of the Coronavirus pandemic rests on the ability to quickly and reliably identify those who have been in close proximity to a contagious individual. Existing tools for doing so rely on the collection of exact location information of individuals over lengthy time periods, and combining this information with other personal information. This unprecedented encroachment on individual privacy at national scales has created an outcry and risks rejection of these tools.
We propose an alternative: an extremely simple scheme for providing fine grained and timely alerts to users who have been in the close vicinity of an infected individual. Crucially, this is done while preserving the anonymity of all individuals, and without collecting or storing any personal information or location history. Our approach is based on using short range communication mechanisms, like Bluetooth, that are available in all modern cell phones. It can be deployed with very little infrastructure, and incurs a relatively low false positive rate compared to other collocation methods. We also describe a number of extensions and tradeoffs.
We believe that the privacy guarantees provided by the scheme will encourage quick and broad voluntary adoption. When combined with sufficient testing capacity and existing best practices from healthcare professionals, we hope that this may significantly reduce the infection rate.
To avoid confusion, we stress that this work does not propose any direct medical treatment. Rather, it proposes a way to pool together information from the community in order to help (a) direct medical personnel in how to best allocate and use testing resources, and (b) direct individuals as to when to get tested and self quarantine.
This means that we could have, for example, p New = 1 30 , meaning that new tokens are broadcast, in expectation, every 30 minutes. Of course, the Bloom filter is naturally compressible, so these are very conservative estimates.
Trusted server computation. If the server is trusted to do Bloom filter queries, then communication can be significantly curtailed, with the user only needing to send the tokens that is has seen. Assuming, say, 100 contacts per day, each for 5 minutes (i.e., 5 ticks), this results in communication bits 5000λ bits to the server each day, recalling that each token is of length λ bits. This means that even λ = 100 bit tokens result in roughly 63KB of transmission to the server. 9"	0

2901	"Background: Multiple reports have pointed towards involvement of community and socioeconomic characteristics of people in the United States may be associated with COVID 19 cases and deaths.
In this study, zip code level data from 5 major metropolitan areas, was utilized to study the effect of multiple demographic & socioeconomic factors  including race, age, income, chronic disease comorbidity, population density, number of people per household on number of positive cases and ensuing death. Adjusted linear regression analysis using 13 to 16 such variables was performed.
: Overall, 442 zip codes reporting 93,170 positive COVID 19 cases and 138 zip codes reporting mortality ranging from 0 to 25 were included in this study. A multivariable linear regression model noted that 1% increase in the proportion of residents above the age of 65 years, proportion of African American residents, proportion of females, persons per household and population density of the zip code increased the proportion of positive cases by 0.77%, 0.23%, 1.64%, 1.83% and 0.46% respectively (P<0.01) with only population density remaining significant in zip codes with greater than median number of cases. In zips with greater than median number of deaths, no community/socio economic factor contributed significantly to death. Conclusion: This study gives early signals of gender, and racial inequalities while providing overwhelming evidence of how population density may contribute to an increase in the number of positive cases of COVID 19.

2902	"Background. Medical editorials have suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should not be given to people with arterial hypertension during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic because of a potential increased risk of worse clinical outcomes and that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) should be used as an alternative. Methods Using a cohort of 610 COVID 19 cases and 48,667 population based controls from Zheijang, China we have tested the role of usage of ACEIs, ARBs, CCBs and other medications on risk and severity of COVID 19. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex and BMI and for presence of relevant comorbidities. Findings: Higher BMI, diabetes and cardio/ cerebrovascular disease are independent risk factors for the development of COVID 19. Individuals with hypertension taking CCBs had significantly increased risk [odds ratio (OR)= 1.67 (95% CI 1.2 2.9)) of manifesting symptoms of COVID 19 whereas those taking ARBs and diuretics had significantly lower disease risk (OR=0.24; 95%CI 0.17 0.34 and OR=0.32; 95%CI 0.19 0.57 respectively). Other antihypertensive drugs were not associated with increased .

2904	National rail passenger services in Great Britain have been largely delivered by a system of franchising since 1996. As reported at previous Thredbo Conferences, this system has had several iterations and a number of failures, with one franchise (for the East Coast) having failed three times. This paper will use national level and operator specific data provided by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) to review recent key trends in rail demand and supply. It will extend an existing modelling framework to determine the costs and benefits of rail franchising at the national level. It will also undertake case studies of two franchises, for the East Coast and South West. In advance of the on going Williams Review, policy prescriptions will be suggested for both the commercial and the social railway with particular reference to contract specifications.	1
2905	"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2 / COVID 19) pandemic is a worldwide emergency. An increasing number of diarrhea cases is reported. Here we investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular mechanisms, management, and prevention of SARS CoV 2 associated diarrhea.
: We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to March 2020 to identify studies documenting diarrhea and mechansism of intestinal inflammation in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS CoV 2 infection.
Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases. It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms. A pooled analysis revealed an overall percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%. SARS CoV uses the the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not only expressed in lung, but also in the small intestinal epithelia. ACE2 is expressed furthermore in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon. SARS CoV 2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10 20 times) compared with SARS CoV. Several reports indicate viral RNA shedding in stool detectable longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs. Current treatment is supportive, but several options appear promising and are the subject of investigation.
Conclusion: Diarrhea is a frequent presenting symptom in patients infected with SARS CoV 2.
Increasing evidence indicates possible fecal oral transmission, indicating the need for a rapid and effective modification of the screening and diagnostic algorithms. The optimal methods to prevent, manage, and treat diarrhea in COVID 19 infected patients are subjects of intensive research."	0
2906	2019 nCoV is a newly identified coronavirus with high similarity to SARS CoV. We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures. However, 2019 nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019 nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019 nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019 nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal oral and other routes of transmission are also possible. Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus.	0

2908	"Background: Longitudinal samples from two production sites were used to (1) describe the pattern of PEDV shedding (rRT PCR) in individual rectal swabs, pen fecal samples, and pen oral fluids (OF); (2) describe the kinetics of PEDV antibody by ELISA (IgA, IgG) testing of pig serum and pen oral fluid samples; and (3) establish cutoffs and performance estimates for PEDV WV ELISAs (IgA, IgG). Site One was PEDV positive; Site Two was PEDV negative. On Site One, pen samples (feces and oral fluids) and pig samples (rectal swabs and sera) were collected both before and after the population was exposed to PEDV. Results: On Site Two, pen oral fluid samples and individual pig serum samples were negative for both PEDV antibody and nucleic acid. On Site One, PEDV was detected by rRT PCR at 6 days post exposure (DPE) in all sample types. The last rRT PCR positives were detected in rectal swabs and oral fluids on 69 DPE. IgG and IgA were detected in oral fluids and serum samples by 13 DPE. Analysis of the PEDV serum IgG WV ELISA data showed that a sample to positive (S/P) cutoff of ≥ 0.80 provided a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.87 (95 % CI: 0.82, 0.91) and specificity of 0.99 (95 % CI: 0.98, 1.00). Serum IgG results declined slowly over the monitoring period, with 60 % of serum samples positive (S/P ≥ 0.80) at the final sampling on 111 DPE. Analysis of the PEDV oral fluid IgA WV ELISA found that a cutoff of S/P ≥ 0.80 provided a diagnostic sensitivity of 1.00 (95 % CI: 0.92, 1.00) and a diagnostic specificity of 1.00 (95 % CI: 0.99, 1.00). The oral fluid IgA response increased through 96 DPE and began to decline at the last sampling on 111 DPE.
Conclusions: This study showed that oral fluid based testing could provide an easy and ""animal friendly"" approach to sample collection for nucleic acid and/or antibody based surveillance of PEDV in swine populations."	0

2915	Early assessments of the spreading rate of COVID 19 were subject to significant uncertainty, as expected with limited data and difficulties in case ascertainment, but more reliable inferences can now be made. Here, we estimate from European data that COVID 19 cases the impact of such measures is typically only seen nine days  i.e. three doubling times  after their implementation. We argue that such temporal patterns are more critical than precise estimates of the basic reproduction number for initiating interventions. This observation has particular implications for the low and middle income countries currently in the early stages of their local epidemics.	1

2917	"A gene encoding SARS CoV 2 M pro (ORF1ab polyprotein residues 3264 3569, GenBank code: MN908947.3) with Escherichia coli (E. coli) codon usage was synthesized by MWG Eurofins. The synthesized gene was first amplified with the forward primer 5′ TCGGGGTTTCGCAAAAT 3′ and the reverse primer 5′ CTGAAACGTGACACCGCTACA 3′. Subsequently, this PCR product was employed as the template for the amplification of the target gene with primers (forward) 5′ CGCGGATCCTCGGCAGTGCTGCAATCGGGGTTTCGCAAAAT 3′, and (reverse) 5′ CCGCTCGAGTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGGGGTCCCTGAAACGTGACACCGCTACAC T  3′ including the cleavage sites of restriction enzymes for cloning into the vector PGEX 6p 1 (GE Healthcare). The amplified PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the vector PGEX 6p 1 digested with the same restriction enzymes. At the N terminus, the construct designed for SARS CoV 2 M pro contains the M pro cleavage site (SAVLQ↓SGFRK; arrow indicates the cleavage site) corresponding to the cleavage site between Nsp4 and Nsp5 in the polyprotein of this virus. At the C terminus, the construct codes for a modified PreScission cleavage site (SGVTFQ↓GP; the six residue sequence at the C terminus of the SARS CoV 2 M pro was used as P6 P1 for PreScission cleavage) connected to a His6 tag. An authentic N terminus was generated during gene expression by auto cleavage of the M pro itself, and the authentic C terminus was generated after the treatment with PreScission protease, similar to the approach described for SARS CoV M pro in (20). The gene sequence of the M pro was verified by sequencing at MWG Eurofins.
The sequence verified SARS CoV 2 M pro construct was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 Gold (DE3) (Novagen). Transformed clones were pre cultured at 37°C in 50 mL 1 x YT Cloning, gene expression, and protein purification of SARS CoV M pro was performed according to (20) and (14).
A freshly prepared protein solution at a concentration of 25 mg/mL was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 x g. Subsequently, a basic screen with the commercially available screening kit PACT premier TM HT 96 (Molecular Dimensions) was performed by using a Gryphon LCP crystallization robot (Art Robbins) employing the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 18°C. 0.15 μL of protein solution and 0.15 μL of reservoir were mixed to equilibrate against 40 μL reservoir solution. Crystals appeared overnight under several conditions, e.g. condition B5 (0.1 M MIB (sodium malonate, imidazole, and boric acid in molar ratio 2:3:3), pH 8.0, 25% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1,500), condition D4 (0.1 M MMT (DL malic acid, MES, and Tris base in molar ratio 1:2:2), pH 7.0, 25% PEG 1,500), condition E9 (0.2 M potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate, 20% PEG 3,350), etc. Crystals were fished from the drops and cryo protected by mother liquor plus varied concentrations of glycerol (10% 20%). Subsequently, fished crystals were flash cooled in liquid nitrogen.
Freshly prepared protein (as described above) at a concentration of 25 mg/mL was mixed with 13b (dissolved in 100% DMSO) at a molar ratio of 1:5. The mixture was incubated at 4°C

2921	Recently, the lung infection due to Coronavirus Disease (COVID 19) affected a large human group worldwide and the assessment of the infection rate in the lung is essential for treatment planning. This research aims to propose a Machine Learning System (MLS) to detect the COVID 19 infection using the CT scan Slices (CTS). This MLS implements a sequence of methods, such as multi thresholding, image separation using threshold filter, feature extraction, feature selection, feature fusion and classification. The initial part implements the Chaotic Bat Algorithm and Kapur's Entropy (CBA KE) thresholding to enhance the CTS. The threshold filter separates the image into two segments based on a chosen threshold 'Th'. The texture features of these images are extracted, refined and selected using the chosen procedures. Finally, a two class classifier system is implemented to categorize the chosen CTS (n=500 with a pixel dimension of 512x512x1) into normal/COVID 19 group. In this work, the classifiers, such as Naive Bayes (NB), k Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine with linear kernel (SVM) are implemented and the classification task is performed using various feature vectors.

2923	Since its first recorded appearance in December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) causing the disease COVID 19 has resulted in more than 2,000,000 infections and 128,000 deaths. Currently there is no proven treatment for COVID 19 and there is an urgent need for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Coronavirus spike glycoproteins they provide host cell recognition and membrane fusion between virus and host cell. Thus, they emerged as popular and promising drug targets. Crystal structures of spike protein in its closed and open states were resolved very recently in March 2020. These structures comprise 77% of the sequence and provide almost the complete protein structure. Based on down and up positions of receptor binding domain (RBD), spike protein can be in a receptor inaccessible closed or receptor accessible open state, respectively.

2924	Objective: This study presents a preliminary report on the chest radiographic and computed tomography (CT) findings of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID 19) pneumonia in Korea. Materials and Methods: As part of a multi institutional collaboration coordinated by the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology, we collected nine patients with COVID 19 infections who had undergone chest radiography and CT scans. We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of COVID 19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher's exact test was used to compare CT findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions. Results: Three of the nine patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill defined and were composed of mixed ground glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground glass opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p < 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006). Conclusion: COVID 19 pneumonia in Korea primarily manifested as pure to mixed ground glass opacities with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. A considerable proportion of patients with COVID 19 pneumonia had normal chest radiographs.	0
2925	The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is widely recognized as a complex and contentious space for oil exploration and production. Over the past few decades, the Niger Delta has witnessed large scale mass peaceful mobilizations and rebellion like conditions from violent militia groups. Oil companies have been implicated in violence perpetrated by Nigerian security forces. Local host communities have suffered greatly from corruption, political instability, violence and the environmental devastation of their farmlands and fishing grounds. Oil companies have increasingly turned to corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives to attempt to build or repair relations with oil producing communities. There are also governmental and nongovernmental humanitarian actors supporting various initiatives in the oil producing areas. This article highlights the challenges that one long running micro scale development project has faced due to the COVID 19 disease outbreak and the closure of all schools in Rivers State, Nigeria in March 2020. The school closures have halted some initiatives, but our weekly nutritional program feedings have continued in new, socially distanced forms.	1

Abstract: Objectives: To explore the clinical course and its dynamic features of immune status in COVID 19 patients and find predictors correlated with severity and prognosis of COVID 19. Methods: The electronic medical records of 204 patients with COVID 19 pneumonia confirmed by nucleic acid testing were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: All Patients were divided into severe (69) and non severe group (135). Lymphocyte subsets count, including CD3  T cell, CD4  T cell, CD8  T cell, B cell (CD19 ) and NK J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f cell (CD16 56 ), were significantly lower in severe group (P＜0.001). The dynamic levels of T lymphocytes in severe group were significantly lower from disease onset, but in the improved subgroup the value of T lymphocyte began to increase after about 15 day treatment and finally returned to the normal level. The cut off value of the counts of CD3  (576), CD4  (391) and CD8  (214) T cell were calculated and indicated significantly high sensitivity and specificity for severity of COVID 19. Conclusion: Our results shown that the decrease of CD3 , CD4  and CD8  T lymphocyte correlated with the course of patients with COVID 19 pneumonia, especially in severe cases. The level of T lymphocyte could be used as an indicator for prediction of severity and prognosis of patients with COVID 19 pneumonia.

2930	As the number of cases of COVID 19 continues to grow exponentially, local health services are likely to be overwhelmed with patients requiring intensive care. We develop and implement an algorithm to provide optimal re routing strategies to either transfer patients requiring Intensive Care Units (ICU) or ventilators, constrained by feasibility of transfer. We validate our approach with realistic data extracted from UK and Spain. For the UK case, we coarse grain the NHS system at the level of NHS trusts and, subsequently cover the whole set of geopositioned trusts to extract a 4 regular geometric graph which indicates, for a given trust, its four nearest neighbors. The Spanish case is analysed at the autonomous community level, and we extract a contact network where nodes correspond to autonomous communities and links indicate adjacent communities. Estimates of weekly ICU demand could be extrapolated from an age structured epidemiological model by considering contagion to ICU likelihood estimates or alternatively from available data. Through random search optimisation we identify the best load sharing strategy, where the cost function to minimise is based on the total number of ICU units above capacity and we implement and test two optimisation strategies. Our framework is flexible allowing for additional criteria, different cost functions, and this methodology is general enough that it can easily be extended to optimise other resources beyond ICU units or ventilators. Assuming a uniform ICU demand across trusts, we show that using our method it is possible to enable access to ICU treatment to up to 1000 cases in the UK in a single step of the algorithm, and with more realistic demand the algorithm is able to balance about 600 beds per step in the Spanish system  leading to potentially saving a large percentage of these lives that would otherwise not have access to ICU if no load sharing was implemented.	0

Although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019‐nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. As of February 1, 2020, a total of 3,099 persons on 437 flights were screened; five symptomatic travelers were referred by CDC to local health care providers for further medical evaluation, and one of these persons tested positive for 2019‐nCoV.

2937	The discovery of SARS CoV 2, the responsible virus for the Covid 19 epidemic, has sparked a global health concern with many countries affected. Developing models that can interpret the epidemic and give common trend parameters are useful for prediction purposes by other countries that are at an earlier phase of the epidemic; it is also useful for future planning against viral respiratory diseases. One model is developed to interpret the fast growth phase of the epidemic and another model for the full interpretation during the fast , slow and plateau phases. Both models are shown to agree reasonably with the data. It is shown that during the fast phase, the number of new infected cases in several countries depends on the total number of cases by a power law relation with a scaling exponent equal to 0.82. During this phase, the duplication time is 1  3 days. The duplication time together with another parameter that controls the phase change from the fast phase to the slow and plateau phases, varying in the range of 0.1  0.5, may be used for data interpretation and for guiding predictions regarding this disease, e.g. the onset of the maximum in the number of new cases.	0

2939	The world is under pressure from the novel COVID 19 pandemic. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world and predicted to be affected significantly over a longer time period. Our paper aims to provide detailed reporting and analyses of the present rapid responses to COVID 19, between January and March 2020, in Indonesia. We particularly highlight responses taken by the governments, non government organisations and the community. We outline gaps and limitations in the responses, based on our rapid analysis present five recommendations toward more rapid, effective, and comprehensive responses.	1

Background: An outbreak of COVID 19 occurred on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in January and February 2020. We analysed information about cases to infer transmission dynamics and potential modes of transmission.
We collected the of the 146 passenger cases in two categories, i.e. those who stayed and did not stay in the same stateroom. We retrieved the quarantine details and the ship's 14 day itinerary. We searched the websites of national/local health authority along the cruise routes and local news using Google for locally confirmed cases associated with the ship. We obtained the design of air conditioning and sewage treatment of the ship from literature. We back calculated the dates of infection from the epidemic curve and compared with the start of on board quarantine."	1

Our results show which interventions potentially push the epidemic peak into the subsequent year (when vaccinations resulted in 22% to 63% of the population sick, 0.2% to 0.6% hospitalised, and 0.07% to 0.28% dead (n=6,450 to 28,228).	1

Despite the time critical nature of airway management in critically ill patients with COVID 19, we recommend a rapid airway assessment be performed allowing for early planning of airway management to avoid unexpected deterioration and clinical decision making. 2 Overall, we applaud Dr Orser's 1 recommendations, and also wish to highlight that health care providers should be protected to maximum available level, while still taking account of ongoing global PPE shortage. 2 Prioritization of clinicians involved in highrisk AGPs is crucial for the sustainability in delivering health care during this pandemic. We need to be well prepared to enter the den of the beast.	0
2944	"A novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) outbreak has caused a global pandemic resulting in tens of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also named nsp12), which catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA, is a key 5 component of coronaviral replication/transcription machinery and appears to be a primary target for the antiviral drug, remdesivir. Here we report the cryo EM structure of 2019 nCoV full length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 at a resolution of 2.9 Å. Additional to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family and a nidovirus RdRp associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain featured in coronaviral RdRp, nsp12 10 possesses a newly identified β hairpin domain at its N terminal. Key residues for viral replication and transcription are observed. A comparative analysis to show how remdesivir binds to this polymerase is also provided. This structure provides insight into the central component of coronaviral replication/transcription machinery and sheds light on the design of new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral RdRp.
One Sentence Summary: Structure of 2019 nCov RNA polymerase. infections and 4291 fatalities have been confirmed globally. 2019 nCoV is reported to be a new member of the betacoronavirus genus and is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) and to several bat coronaviruses (4). Compared to SARS CoV and 5 MERS CoV, 2019 nCoV appears to exhibit faster human to human transmission, thus leading to the WHO declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)(1, 3).
CoVs employ a multi subunit replication/transcription machinery, being assembled by a set of non structural proteins (nsp) produced as cleavage products of the ORF1a and ORF1ab viral polyproteins (5) to facilitate virus replication and transcription. A key component, the RNA 10 dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA and thus plays a central role in the replication and transcription cycle of 2019 nCoV, possibly with the assistance of nsp7 and nsp8 as co factors (5, 6). Therefore, nsp12 is a primary target for the nucleotide analog antiviral inhibitors, e.g. remdesivir which shows potential to treat 2019 nCoV infections (7, 8). To inform drug design we have determined the structure of nsp12, in complex with its cofactors nsp7 15 and nsp8 by cryo Electron Microscopy (Cryo EM) using two different protocols, one in the absence of DTT (Dataset 1) and the other in the presence of DTT (Dataset 2).
The bacterially expressed full length 2019 nCoV nsp12 (residues S1 Q932) was incubated with nsp7 (residues S1 Q83) and nsp8 (residues A1 Q198), and the complex was then purified (fig. S1). Cryo EM grids were prepared using this complex and preliminary screening revealed 20 excellent particle density with good dispersity. After collecting and processing 7,994 micrograph movies, we obtained a 2.9 Å resolution 3D reconstruction of one nsp12 monomer in complex with one nsp7 nsp8 pair and one nsp8. Like that observed in SARS CoV nsp12 nsp7 nsp8 (6), we observed classes corresponding to an nsp12 monomer in complex one nsp8, as well as individual nsp12s, but these do not give atomic resolution reconstructions ( fig. S2 ). However, the nsp12 25 nsp7 nsp8 complex provides all the structural information for complete and comprehensive analysis.
The structure of the 2019 nCoV nsp12 contains a ""right hand"" polymerase domain (residues S367 F920), and a nidovirus unique N terminal extension domain (residues D60 R249) adopting a nidovirus RdRp associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN)(9) architecture, being connected by 30 an interface domain (residues A250 F369) (Figs. 1, A and B). An additional N terminal β hairpin (V31 K50) was built with the guidance of an unambiguous cryo EM map (fig. S3A), inserting into the groove clamped by the NiRAN domain and the palm subdomain in the RdRp domain (Fig. 2) . The nsp7 nsp8 pair shows a conserved structure similar to the SARS CoV nsp7 nsp8 pair (6, 10). The orientation of the N terminal helix of another individual nsp8 bound to nsp12 is shifted 35 compared with that in the nsp7 nsp8 pair ( fig. S4 ). The polypeptides of nsp12 can be traced in the map, except for S1 V30, T51 S68, H75, K103 V111, D336, T896 S904, F921 Q932, which cannot be observed.
Although the overall architecture of 2019 nCoV nsp12 nsp7 nsp8 complex is generally similar to that of SARS CoV with an r.m.s.d value of 0.82 for 1,078 Cɑ atoms there are key features that 40 distinguish them. First, the cryo EM map allows us to build the structure of 2019 nCoV nsp12 covering almost all residues, presenting the first insight into the complete architecture of coronaviral RdRp. In SARS CoV nsp12, there are seven helices with a three stranded β sheet at the end that make up the NiRAN domain (6) ( Fig. 2A) . Residues Y69 R118 constitute an additional structural block with three anti parallel β strands and one helix. Residues N215 D218 45 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. : bioRxiv preprint 4 form a β strand in 2019 nCoV nsp12. We reasoned that the contact of this region with the strand (residues V96 A100) helps to stabilize it. As a result, these four strands form a compact semi βbarrel architecture. Therefore, we identify residues Y69 R249 as the complete coronaviral NiRAN domain. Second, the cryo EM map helps us to identify a unique N terminal β hairpin (Figs. 1A and 2A). This β hairpin inserts in the groove clamped by the NiRAN domain and the palm 5 subdomain in the RdRp domain and forms a set of close contacts to stabilize the overall structure ( Fig. 2B and fig. S5 ). Another point to note is that, we have observed C301 C306 and C487 C645 form disulfide bonds in the absence of DTT (Dataset 1). However, in the presence of DTT (Dataset 2), chelated zinc ions are present and in the same location as that observe in SARS CoV ( fig. S3B) . We reasoned the different purification buffer has led to this variation.
The polymerase domain adopts the conserved architecture of the viral polymerase family (11) and is composed of three subdomains, including a fingers subdomain (residues S397 A581 and K621 G679), a palm subdomain (residues T582 P620 and T680 Q815), and a thumb subdomain (residues H816 E920) (Fig. 1) . The catalytic cations, which are usually observed in viral polymerase structure for RNA synthesis (12, 13) are not observed, possibly because manganese 15 was not included in the buffer for purification or in the cryo EM sampling buffer. The active site chamber of 2019 nCoV RdRp domain is formed by the conserved polymerase motifs A G in the palm domain and configured like other RNA polymerases (Figs. 1A and 3A; fig. S6). Motif A covers residues 611 TPHLMGWDYPKCDRAM 626 with a potential divalentcation binding residue D618, which is conserved in HCV ns5b (residue D220) and poliovirus (PV) 20 3D pol (residue D233) (12, 13) (Figs. 3, B and C). Motif B is in the region 680 TSSGDATTAYANSVFNICQAVTANVNALLST 710. Motif C (residues 753 FSMMILSDDAVVCFN 767) contains the catalytic residues (759 SDD 761) in the turn between the two β strands. These catalytic residues are also conserved in viral RdRp, e.g. 317 GDD 319 in HCV ns5b and 327 GDD 329 PV 3D pol with the first residue being a glycine residue as an 25 alternative. Motif D is assigned as 775 LVASIKNFKSVLYYQNNVFMSE 796. Motif E (810 HEFCSQHTMLV 820) forms the tight loop. Motif F (912 KKNQHGGLRE 921) forms an ordered loop (β loop) connecting two anti parallel β strands. Motif G is in 500 KSAGFPFNKWGKARLYYDS 518.
In this structure, the four positively charged solvent accessible paths converge into a central cavity 30 where the RdRp motifs mediate template directed RNA synthesis (Fig. 3D ). The configurations of the template/primer entry paths, the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry channel, and the nascent strand exit path are similar to those described for HCV and PV polymerase (14) (Figs. 3, B and C). The NTP entry channel is formed by a set of hydrophilic residues, including K545, R553 and R555 in motif F. The RNA template is expected to enter the active site composed of motifs A and 35 C through a groove clamped by motif F and G. Motif E and the thumb subdomain support the primer strand. The product template hybrid exits the active site through the RNA exit tunnel at the front side of the polymerase.
Remdesivir, the single Sp isomer of the 2 ethylbutyl L alaninate phosphoramidate prodrug (15) ( fig. S7 ), has been reported to inhibit 2019 nCoV proliferation and have potential to treat patients 40 in the clinic (7, 8). The efficacy of chain terminating nucleotide analogs requires viral RdRps to recognize and successfully incorporate the active form of the inhibitors into the growing RNA strand. Because of the structural conservation on the polymerase catalytic chamber between 2019 nCoV and HCV ns5b polymerase, as well as the likely similar mechanisms of action of remdesivir and sofosbuvir (12, 16) (2' F 2' C methyluridine monophosphate prodrug which targets HCV 45 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. : bioRxiv preprint 5 ns5b and has been approved for the treatment of chronic HCV infection) ( fig. S7) , a model of 2019 nCoV nsp12 with remdesivir diphosphate is proposed (Fig. 4) . In 2019 nCoV nsp12, the 2' hydroxyl of the incoming NTP is likely to form hydrogen bonds with T680 and N691 in motif B (Figs. 4, A and B ). In addition, D623 in motif A is positioned to interrogate the 3' hydroxyl through hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the hydrophobic side chain of V557 in motif F is likely to stack with 5 and stabilize the  1 template RNA uridine base to base pair with the incoming triphosphate remdesivir (ppp remdesivir). In the structures of HCV ns5b elongation complex or its complex with pp sofosbuvir, a key feature is that the incorporated pp sofosbuvir disrupts the hydrogen bonding network between S282 and D225 (Figs. 4, C and D), which is necessary to stabilize the incoming natural nucleotide (12). However, key contacts formed by S282 with the incoming 10 nucleotide and the surrounding environment can result in an S→T resistance mutation that is already observed in the clinic (17). In the structure of apo 2019 nCoV nsp12, the orientation of S682 and D623, which are strictly conserved with S282 and D225 in HCV ns5b, is similar to that observed in the HCV ns5b pp sofosbuvir complex, indicating a different recognition mechanism with that inhibitor. Nevertheless, the close distance of S682 with the incoming ppp remdesivir and 15 the environment surrounding the inhibitor alters the appearance of a drug resistant mutation associated with remdesivir treatments.
The rapid global spread of 2019 nCoV has emphasized the need for the development of new coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics. The viral polymerase nsp12 looks an excellent target for new therapeutics, especially given that lead inhibitors already exist in the form of compounds such 20 as remdesivir. This target, in addition to other promising drug targets such as the main protease, whose structure was recently determined by our group (18) in complex with an inhibitor (19, 20) will support the development of a cocktail of anti coronavirus treatments that potentially can be used for the discovery of broad spectrum antivirals. 25"	0

2948	"Background. The epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019 nCoV is of great interest to researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented.
Objective. Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time.
In this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988 1989.
The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. The numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted.
Conclusions. Simple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic caused by coronavirus 2019 nCoV in mainland China.

2949	Seasonal influenza is a recurring health burden shared widely across the globe. We study whether air quality affects the occurrence of severe influenza cases that require inpatient hospitalization. Using longitudinal information on local air quality and hospital admissions across the United States, we find that poor air quality increases the incidence of significant influenza hospital admissions. Effects diminish in years with greater influenza vaccine effectiveness. Apart from increasing vaccination rates, improving air quality may help reduce the spread and severity of influenza.	0

2952	"11 Background: Faced with the global pandemic of COVID 19, declared by World Health 12 Organization (WHO) on March 11 th 2020, and the need to better understand the seasonal 13 behavior of the virus, our team conducted this systematic review to describe current 14 knowledge about the emergence and replicability of the virus and its correlation as temperature and relative humidity. Results: The initial screening identified 517 articles. After examination of the full texts, 22 seventeen studies met the review's eligibility criteria. Great homogeneity was observed 23 in the findings regarding the effect of temperature and humidity on the seasonal viability 24 and transmissibility of COVID 19. Cold and dry conditions were potentiating factors on 25 the spread of the virus. After quality assessment, four studies had a high risk of bias and 26 thirteen studies were scored as moderate risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was 27 graded as low for both outcomes evaluated.

2953	"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 has had a massive impact on the whole world. Computed tomography (CT) has been widely used in the diagnosis of this novel pneumonia. This study aims to understand the role of CT for the diagnosis and the main imaging manifestations of patients with COVID 19.
We conducted a rapid review and meta analysis on studies about the use of chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID 19. We comprehensively searched databases and preprint servers on chest CT for patients with COVID 19 between 1 January 2020 and 31 March 2020. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of chest CT imaging. We also conducted subgroup analyses and evaluated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
Results: A total of 104 studies with 5694 patients were included. Using RT PCR results as reference, a meta analysis based on 64 studies estimated the sensitivity of chest CT imaging in COVID 19 was 99% (95% CI, 0.97 1.00). If case reports were excluded, the sensitivity in case series was 96% (95% CI, 0.93 0.99). The sensitivity of CT scan in confirmed patients under 18 years old was only 66% (95% CI, 0.11 1.00). The most common imaging manifestation was ground glass opacities (GGO) which was found in 75% (95% CI, 0.68 0.82) of the patients. The pooled probability of bilateral involvement was 84% (95% CI, 0.81 0.88). The most commonly involved lobes were the right lower lobe (84%, 95% CI, 0.78 0.90) and left lower lobe (81%, 95% CI, 0.74 0.87). The quality of evidence was low across all outcomes.

In conclusion, this meta analysis indicated that chest CT scan had a high sensitivity in diagnosis of patients with COVID 19. Therefore, CT can potentially be used to assist in the diagnosis of COVID 19. : medRxiv preprint
We performed a meta analysis using STATA 15.1. We present data from eligible studies in an evidence table and using descriptive statistics. The percentages of the sensitivity of CT examination and the probability of imaging manifestations in patients with COVID 19 were computed using the metaprop command (Stata) for the meta analysis of proportions. metaprop allows the inclusion of studies with proportions equal to 0 or 100% and avoids CIs surpassing the 0 to 1 range, where normal approximation procedures often break down. It achieves this by using the binomial distribution to model within study variability or by allowing Freeman Tukey double arcsine transformation to stabilize the variances.
We generated a forest plot to show the individual and pooled probabilities of positive initial CT examination, their 95% CI and study weights. We conducted subgroup analyses based on case series, and children (≤18).
The quality of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (16).
The criteria mainly considered included study methodological quality, directness of the evidence, heterogeneity of data, precision of effect estimates, and risk of publication bias All rights reserved.

A PCR multiplex study Reçu le 22 octobre 2012 ; accepté le 21 novembre 2012 Disponible sur Internet le 20 décembre 2012 Résumé Les infections respiratoires sont un problème de santé publique. Leur cause en est majoritairement virale chez le jeune enfant. La mise au point de techniques de détection par biologie moléculaire a permis d'en élargir le spectre virologique. L'objectif de notre travail est d'évaluer la corrélation entre les résultats des prélèvements effectués par aspiration rhinopharyngée et par lavage bronchoalvéolaire. Trente enfants présentant une symptomatologie d'infection respiratoire basse ont ainsi été prélevés aux deux sites au cours d'une même séance. Les échantillons ont été analysés par Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) virale multiplex (xTAG TM RVP). Une corrélation forte est retrouvée entre la positivité de la PCR virale dans les voies respiratoires hautes et basses ( p = 0,0002). Le virus le plus fréquemment isolé est l'entéro rhinovirus. Ces résultats confirment que l'infection virale touche l'appareil respiratoire de façon diffuse, et suggèrent que le prélèvement par aspiration rhinopharyngée suffit au diagnostic virologique d'une infection respiratoire virale basse chez l'enfant immunocompétent.   2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Respiratory tract infections are frequent in young children and are related to viruses in most cases. Multiplex Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques are valuable tools for describing the spectrum of such viruses. The goal of this study was to assess the correlation of virus detection in samples obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration and by bronchoalveolar lavage. Both samples were taken at the same time in 30 children with lower respiratory tract infection, and were analyzed by multiplex virus PCR (xTAG TM RVP). A strong correlation has been found (P = 0.0002) and the most frequently isolated virus was the entero rhinovirus spp. These results strengthen the opinion that viruses colonize both the upper and lower respiratory tract. Nasopharyngeal samples should be sufficient to the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract viral infection in immuno competent children.  "	0

2958	Obviously, the occurrence of this pandemic does not diminish the burden of other diseases, rather the focus is temporarily shifted towards infectious diseases; while this shift in focus is fully appreciable and also necessary to deal with the huge impact of COVID 19 infections throughout the world, it is important not to forget some essential matters that are part of our regular work. Given the requirement of laboratory control (to obtain an international normalized ratio, INR) in all patients on VKA, there is a current tendency among anticoagulation clinics to urge general practitioners to rapidly switch from VKA to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), because of the patient.	0

2960	The SARS CoV 2 pandemic has resulted in widespread morbidity and mortality globally, but with widely variable outcomes. The development of severe disease and mortality is higher in older individuals, males and those with other co morbidities, and may vary across ethnic groups. However, so far, no host genetic factor has been clearly associated with susceptibility and development of severe disease. To understand the impact of host genetics on expression of ACE2 (SARS CoV 2 receptor) during RNA virus infection we performed a GWAS for ACE2 expression in HCV infected liver tissue from 195 individuals. We discovered that polymorphisms in the host IFNL region which control expression of IFNL3 and IFNL4 modulate ACE2 expression. ACE2 expression was regulated additionally by age, with a subsidiary effect of co morbidity. The IFNL locus controlled expression of a gene network incorporating many well known interferon stimulated genes which anticorrelated with ACE2 transcript levels. The same anti correlation was found in the gastrointestinal tract, a site of SARS CoV 2 replication where inflammation driven interferon stimulated genes are negatively correlated with ACE2 expression. The interferon dependent regulation of ACE2 was identified in a murine model of SARS CoV 1 suggesting conserved regulation of ACE2 across species. Polymorphisms in the IFNL region, as well as age, may impact not only on classical antiviral responses but also on ACE2 with potential consequences for	1
2961	The adoption of containment measures to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak is a key aspect in tackling the rapid spread of an epidemic. Classical compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. In addition, data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of uncertainty must naturally be incorporated into the models. In this work we address both these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of the epidemiological model in presence of uncertain data. After the introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The need for long term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy. The importance of the timing and intensity of interventions is particularly relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected people. Simulations related to data from the recent COVID 19 outbreak in Italy are presented and discussed.	0

2966	"Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for 2019 novel coronavirus disease . In this study, ten severe patients confirmed by real time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pre transfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65×10 9 /L vs. 0.76×10 9 /L) and decreased C reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesionswithin 7 days. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was welltolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID 19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well controlled trials.
COVID 19is currently a big threat to global health. However, no specific antiviral agents are available for its treatment. In this work, we explored the feasibility of convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue severe patients. The results from 10 severe adult cases showed that one dose (200 mL) of CP was welltolerated and could significantly increase or maintain the neutralizing antibodies at a high level, leading to disappearance of viremia in 7 days. Meanwhile, clinical symptoms and paraclinical criteria rapidly improved within 3 days. Radiological examination All rights reserved.

2967	The aim of this paper consists in the application of a recent epidemiological model, namely SEIR with Social Distancing (SEIR SD), extended here through the definition of a social distancing function varying over time, to assess the situation related to the spreading of the coronavirus Covid 19 in Italy and in two of its most important regions, i.e., Lombardy and Campania. To profitably use this model, the most suitable values of its parameters must be found. The estimation of the SEIR SD model parameters takes place here through the use of Differential Evolution, a heuristic optimization technique. In this way, we are able to evaluate for each of the three above mentioned scenarios the daily number of infectious cases from today until the end of virus spreading, the day(s) in which this number will be at	1
2968	Genome Detective is a web based, user friendly software application to quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation sequencing datasets. This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS related coronavirus (SARSr CoV) and all of the available public data for SARS CoV 2. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to stop the COVID 19 disease.	1
2969	Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) is an ambient trace gas result of both natural and anthropogenic processes. Long term exposure to NO 2 may cause a wide spectrum of severe health problems such as hypertension, diabetes, heart and cardiovascular diseases and even death. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between long term exposure to NO 2 and coronavirus fatality. The Sentinel 5P is used for mapping the tropospheric NO 2 distribution and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for evaluating the atmospheric capability to disperse the pollution. The spatial analysis has been conducted on a regional scale and combined with the number of death cases taken from 66 administrative regions in Italy, Spain, France and Germany. Results show that out of the 4443 fatality cases, 3487 (78%) were in five regions located in north Italy and central Spain. Additionally, the same five regions show the highest NO 2 concentrations combined with downwards airflow which prevent an efficient dispersion of air pollution. These results indicate that the long term exposure to this pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the COVID 19 virus in these regions and maybe across the whole world.	0
2970	Our professional and private lives changed on March 11 2020 when the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) was declared a pandemic by the WHO. By March 16, surgical training was suspended, MRCS and FRCS examinations cancelled and all courses postponed. In theory, essential cancer surgery, emergency and trauma operating will continue. All elective, non essential cases are currently cancelled. While we adapt to our new ways of working, we remind ourselves that surgeons are flexible, resilient and, ultimately, we are doctors in the first instance.

2971	"We introduce the concept of places of social inclusion institutions endowed by a society or a community with material resources, meaning, and values at geographic sites where citizens can access services for specific needs as taken for granted, essential, and inherently precarious. Based on our study of an emergency department that was disrupted by the threat of the Ebola virus in 2014, we develop a process model to explain how a place of social inclusion can be maintained by custodians. We show how these custodians in our fieldsite, doctors and nurses experience and engage in institutional work to manage different levels of tension between the value of inclusion and the reality of finite resources, as well as tension between inclusion and the desire for safety. We also demonstrate how the interplay of custodians' emotions is integral to maintaining the place of social inclusion. The primary contribution of our study is to shine light on places of social inclusion as important institutions in democratic society. We also reveal the theoretical and practical importance of places as institutions, deepen understanding of custodians and custodianship as a form of institutional work, and offer new insight into the dynamic processes that connect emotions and institutional work.
In most Western societies, the democratic state establishes and funds particular places that play a special role in meeting citizens' needs and that contribute to the functioning of societies and communities. For example, citizens can freely access public emergency departments for medical care, public schools for education, public libraries and museums for information and culture, public"	0

Among the two, the latter class, which would be equivalent to (Z)‐CA4, could be quite interesting due to the proximal disposition of two aryl rings and, in this context, 1,5‐triazolyl combretastatin analogs have been prepared.33 In the present case, synthesis of this regioisomer would require reaction of a magnesiated alkyne with an azide,34 but the organometallic reagent would be incompatible with the coumarin.	0

2975	"Acute lung inflammation has severe morbidity, as seen in COVID 19 patients. Lung inflammation is accompanied or led by massive accumulation of neutrophils in pulmonary capillaries (""margination""). We sought to identify nanostructural properties that predispose nanoparticles to accumulate in pulmonary marginated neutrophils, and therefore to target severely inflamed lungs. We designed a library of nanoparticles and conducted an in vivo screen of biodistributions in naive mice and mice treated with lipopolysaccharides. We found that supramolecular organization of protein in nanoparticles predicts uptake in inflamed lungs. Specifically, nanoparticles with agglutinated protein (NAPs) efficiently home to pulmonary neutrophils, while protein nanoparticles with symmetric structure (e.g. viral capsids) are ignored by pulmonary neutrophils. We validated this finding by engineering protein conjugated liposomes that recapitulate NAP targeting to neutrophils in inflamed lungs. We show that NAPs can diagnose acute lung injury in SPECT imaging and that NAP like liposomes can mitigate neutrophil extravasation and pulmonary edema arising in lung inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that ischemic ex vivo human lungs selectively take up NAPs, illustrating translational potential. This work demonstrates that structure dependent interactions with neutrophils can dramatically alter the biodistribution of nanoparticles, and NAPs have significant potential in detecting and treating respiratory conditions arising from injury or infections."	0

A dramatic SARS Cov 2 outbreak is hitting Italy hard. To face the new scenario all the hospitals have been re organised in order to reduce all the outpatient services and to devote almost all their personnel and resources to the management of Covid 19 patients. As a matter of fact, all the services have undergone a deep re organization guided by: the necessity to reduce exams, to create an environment that helps reduce the virus spread, and to preserve the medical personnel from infection. In these days a re organization of the endoscopic unit, sited in a high incidence area, has been adopted, with changes to logistics, work organization and patients selection.

2983	Background: To date, several clinical laboratory parameters associated with COVID 19 severity have been reported. However, these parameters have not been observed consistently across studies. The aim of this review was to assess clinical laboratory parameters which may serve as markers or predictors of severe or critical COVID 19 disease Methods: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases from 2019 through April 18, 2020, and reviewed bibliographies of eligible studies, relevant systematic reviews, and the medRxiv pre print server. We included hospital based observational studies reporting clinical laboratory parameters of confirmed cases of COVID 19 and excluded studies having large proportions (>10%) of children and pregnant women. Two authors independently carried out screening of articles, data extraction and quality assessment. Meta analyses were done using random effects model. Meta median difference (MMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each laboratory parameter. Results: Forty five studies in 6 countries were included. Compared to non severe COVID 19 cases, severe or critical COVID 19 disease was characterised by higher neutrophil count (MMD: 1.23 [95% CI: 0.58 to 1.88] ×10 9 cells/L), and lower lymphocyte and CD4 counts with MMD (95% CI) of  0.39 ( 0.47,  0.31) ×10 9 cells/L and  204.9 ( 302.6,  107.1) cells/μl, respectively. Other notable results were observed for C reactive protein (MMD: 36.97 [95% CI: 27.58, 46.35] mg/L), interleukin 6 (MMD: 17.37 [95% CI: 4.74, 30.00] pg/ml,), Troponin I (MMD: 0.01 [0.00, 0.02] ng/ml), and D dimer (MMD: 0.65 [0.45, 0.85] mg/ml).	0
2984	A model of the spread of viruses in selected city and in a network of cities is considered, taking into account the delay caused by the long incubation period of the virus. The effect of delay effects is shown in comparison with pandemics without such delay. A temporary asymmetry of the spread of infection has been identified, which means that the time for a pandemic to develop significantly exceeds the time for its completion. Model calculations of the spread of viruses in a network of interconnected large and small cities were carried out, and dynamics features were revealed in comparison with the spread of viruses in a single city,	1
2985	The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 (also known as 2019 nCoV) threatens global health, given serious cause for concern. SARS CoV 2 is a human to human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID 19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS CoV 2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID 19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019 nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15 40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019 nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.	0

2987	"Although not widely studied, behavioral host manipulation by various pathogens has been documented. Host manipulation is the process by which a pathogen evolves adaptations to manipulate the behavior of the host to maximize reproduction (R o ) of the pathogen. The most notable example is rabies. When a host is infected with the rabies virus it gets into the host's central nervous system and triggers hyper aggression. The virus is also present in the rabid animal's saliva so being bitten transmits the infection to a new host and the old host is left to eventually die if untreated. Toxoplasmosis is another example. When mice are infected they demonstrate a fearlessness toward cats, thus increasing their chances of being eaten.
Toxoplasmosis needs the digestive tract of the feline to survive. Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans (e.g., through cat feces) has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen. Even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in person sociality during the 48 hour incubation period, thus producing an obvious vector for transmission. Here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus, SARS CoV2, which produces the COVID 19 humans."	0
2988	During the current outbreak of COVID 19, research labs around the globe submit sequences of the local SARS CoV 2 genomes to the GISAID database to provide a comprehensive analysis of the variability and spread of the virus during the outbreak. We explored the variations in the submitted genomes or not, these variants show lower transition/transversion ratio. These singleton variants may influence the estimations of the viral mutation rate and tree topology. We suggest that genomes with multiple singletons even marked as high covered should be considered with caution. We also provide a simple script for checking variant frequency against the database before submission.	1
2989	A messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine has emerged as a promising direction to combat the current COVID 19 pandemic. This requires an mRNA sequence that is stable and highly productive in protein expression, features which have been shown to benefit from greater mRNA secondary structure folding stability and optimal codon usage. However, sequence design remains a hard problem due to the exponentially many synonymous mRNA sequences that encode the same protein. We show that this design problem can be reduced to a classical problem in formal language theory and computational linguistics that can be solved in O(n 3 ) time, where n is the mRNA sequence length. This algorithm could still be too slow for large n (e.g., n = 3, 822 nucleotides for the spike protein of SARS CoV 2), so we further developed a linear time approximate version, Lin earDesign, inspired by our recent work, LinearFold. This algorithm, LinearDesign, can compute the approximate minimum free energy mRNA sequence for this spike protein in just 16 minutes using beam size b = 1, 000, with only 0.6% loss in free energy change compared to exact search (i.e., b =  ∞, which costs 1.6 hours). We also develop two algorithms for incorporating the codon optimality into the design, one based on k best parsing to find alternative sequences and one directly incorporating codon optimality into the dynamic programming. Our work provides efficient computational tools to speed up and GitHub.	0
2990	"An elevated level of viral diversity was found in some SARS CoV 2 infected patients, indicating the risk of rapid evolution of the virus. Although no evidence for the transmission of intra host variants was found, the risk should not be overlooked.
Background A novel coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) has infected more than 75,000 individuals and spread to over 20 countries. It is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how the virus interacts with other microorganisms in the lung.
We have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight SARS CoV 2 patients, 25 community acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, and 20 healthy controls.
The median number of intra host variants was 1 4 in SARS CoV 2 infected patients, which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences).
However, very few intra host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra host variants in a person to person spread, the risk should not be overlooked.
The microbiota in SARS CoV 2 infected patients was similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria.
Conclusion SARS CoV 2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility. Although how the intra host variant spreads in the population is still elusive, it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of the viral 4 evolution in the population and associated clinical changes."	0
2991	"Waiting times between two consecutive infection and recovery events in spreading processes are often assumed to be exponentially distributed, which results in Markovian (i.e., memoryless) continuous spreading dynamics. However, this is not taking into account memory (correlation) effects and discrete interactions that have been identified as relevant in social, transportation, and disease dynamics. We introduce a novel framework to model (non )Markovian susceptible infected recovered (SIR) stochastic processes that are evolving either in continuous or discrete time on networks. We apply our simulation framework to study hybrid SIR processes that describe infections as discretetime Markovian and recovery events as continuous time non Markovian processes, which mimic the distribution of cell cycle times. Our results suggest that the effective spreading rate description of epidemic processes fails to uniquely capture the behavior of such hybrid and also general non Markovian disease dynamics. Providing a unifying description of general Markovian and non Markovian disease outbreaks, we instead show that the mean transmissibility produces the same phase diagrams independent of the underlying inter event time distributions.
Introduction. Models of epidemic processes such as the susceptible infected recovered (SIR) model and related models provided various insights into dynamical and stationary features of disease, opinion, and failure spread in social and technical systems [1] [2] [3] . In the SIR model, infected individuals may transmit a disease to susceptible ones. After a certain period, infected individuals recover and are not part of the diseasetransmission process anymore. The exact time evolution of the continuous time stochastic SIR spreading process is described by the Chapman Kolmogorov equation or its differential form (i.e., the master equation). However, exact analytical solutions of the master equation are limited to special cases and therefore different approximations are being used (e.g., deterministic ODE models [4 6] and cavity like models [7, 8] ). Gillespie and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) approaches [9] provide techniques to generate statistically exact trajectories of a master equation. The assumption underlying kMC methods is that waiting times between consecutive recovery and infection events are exponentially distributed. However, many natural processes including social dynamics [10, 11] exhibit correlation and memory (i.e., non Markovian) effects [12] and are therefore not described by exponential (i.e., memoryless) waiting time distributions [13] . Recent attempts to simulate non Markovian disease dynamics led to the development of the non Markovian Gillespie algorithm (nMGA) [14] and the Laplace Gillespie algorithm (LGA) [15] . Both methods are based on a mapping of multiple stochastic processes with general (continuous) waiting time distributions to a modified kMC algorithm. The nMGA is only exact for a sufficiently large number of processes and requires to re calculate all individual rates at every time step. The LGA interprets survival functions of waiting time distributions as Laplace trans "	0

Research summary: The discovery of the coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) and the spread of COVID 19 have led many governments to take drastic measures. The lockdown of large parts of society and economic life has come as an exogenous shock to many economic actors, not least innovative startups. This rapid response research combines a qualitative research design informed by entrepreneurial ecosystem actors with an analysis of policy measures called for, announced, and reportedly implemented in the international press. Interviews from an entrepreneurial ecosystem offer a first hand account of the adversity startups face during a crisis and how by utilizing bricolage responses they cope, and the analysis of policy measures can serve as an inspiration to design support initiatives to protect startups from the consequences of the current lockdown and to alleviate the effects of future crises.
The lockdown measures as a response to the spread of the new coronavirus threaten the existence of many innovative startups. Our rapid response research first illustrates the challenges entrepreneurs face as a consequence of the crisis. Second, we illustrate how entrepreneurs are dealing with the effects of the crisis and what they are doing to protect their ventures. Finally, we present measures that could be utilized by policymakers to assist entrepreneurs facing challenges. The research conducted suggests that while startups are successfully leveraging their available resources as a first response to the crisis, their growth and innovation potential are at risk. Therefore, policy measures should not only provide first aid to startups by alleviating the pressure caused by constrained cashflow, but also involve long term measures embedded in and supported by the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem to ensure rapid recovery and growth.

2993	In this letter we study the temporal evolution of the Sars Cov 2 in Italy. The time window of the real data is between February 24 and March 25. After we upgrade the data until April 1.We perform the analysis with 4 different model and we think that the best candidate to describe correctly the italian situation is a generalized Logistic equation. We use two coupled differential equations that describe the evolution of the severe infected and the deaths. We have done this choice, because in Italy the pharyngeal swabs are made only to severe infected and so we have no information about asymptomatic people. An important observation is that the virus spreads between Regions with some delay; so we suggest that a different analysis region by region would be more sensible than that on the whole Italy. In particular the region Lombardia has a behaviour very fast with respect to the other ones. We show the behaviour of the total deaths and the total severe infected for Italy and five regions: Lombardia, Emilia Romagna, Veneto, Piemonte, Toscana. Finally we do an analysis of the peak and an estimation of how many lifes have been saved with the LockDown.

3001	The Covid 19 pandemic has claimed many lives in the UK and globally. The objective of this paper is to study whether the novel coronavirus has also been associated with an increase in deaths in England and Wales for those who have not contracted the disease. Reasons behind this may include avoiding visits to hospitals or GPs, and the effects of the lockdown. Methods: I used weekly ONS data on the number of deaths that did not involve covid 19 over the period 2015 2020. Simply observing trends is not sufficient as spikes in deaths may occasionally occur. I thus followed a differences in differences econometric approach to study whether there was a relative increase in non covid 19 deaths during the pandemic, compared to a control. As an additional approach, an interrupted time series model was also used. Results: Results suggest that there were an additional 531 non covid 19 deaths in England and Wales since the outbreak of the pandemic, compared to what would have otherwise been expected [diff in diff interaction coeff: 531.11; 95%CI: 125.65 to 936.57]. This is confirmed by the interrupted time series model. Discussion: The health effects of covid 19 do not seem to be limited only to patients suffering from the disease, as the number of deaths for those who did not contract covid 19 has also demonstrated an absolute and relative increase. Analysing the cause of death for non covid 19 deaths will shed light upon the reasons for the increase in such deaths and will help design appropriate policy responses to save lives.	0
3002	"Background: The epidemiology of COVID 19 remains speculative in Africa. To the best of our knowledge, no study, using robust methodology provides its trajectory for the region or accounts for local context. This paper is the first systematic attempt to provide prevalence, incidence, and mortality estimates across Africa.
Methods: Caseloads and incidence forecasts are from a co variate based instrumental variable regression model. Fatality rates from Italy and China were applied to generate mortality estimates after making relevant health system and population level characteristics related adjustments between each of the African countries.
Results: By June 30 2020, around 16.3 million people in Africa will contract 403 to 98,358,799). Northern and Eastern Africa will be the most and least affected areas. Cumulative cases by June 30 are expected to reach around 2.9 million (95% CI 465,028 to 18,286,358) in Southern Africa, 2.8 million (95% CI 517,489 to 15,056,314) in Western Africa, and 1.2 million (95% CI 229,111 to 6,138,692) in Central Africa. Incidence for the month of April 2020 is expected to be highest in Djibouti, 32.8 per 1000 (95% CI 6.25 to 171.77), while Morocco will experience among the highest fatalities (1,045 deaths, 95% CI 167 to 6,547).
Conclusion: Less urbanized countries with low levels of socio economic development (hence least connected to the world), are likely to register lower and slower transmissions at the early stages of an epidemic. However, the same enabling factors that worked for their benefit can hinder interventions that have lessened the impact of COVID 19 elsewhere."	0
3003	The COVID 19 (formerly, 2019 nCoV) epidemic has become a global health emergency, as such, WHO declared PHEIC. China has taken the most hit since the outbreak of the virus, which could be dated as far back as late November by some experts. It was not until January 23rd that the Wuhan government finally recognized the severity of the epidemic and took a drastic measure to curtain the virus spread by closing down all transportation connecting the outside world. In this study, we seek to answer a few questions: How did the virus get spread from the epicenter Wuhan city to the rest of the country? To what extent did the measures, such as, city closure and community quarantine, help controlling the situation? More importantly, can we forecast any significant future development of the event had some of the conditions changed? By collecting and visualizing publicly available data, we first show patterns and characteristics of the epidemic development; we then employ a mathematical model of disease transmission dynamics to evaluate the effectiveness of some epidemic control measures, and more importantly, to offer a few tips on preventive measures.	1

ABSTRACT. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease that begins in late adolescence or adulthood. It is highly variable in its expression and severity. It is believed to be autoimmune in nature. The cause is unknown; both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis. MS generally presents with the acute or subacute onset of neurologic abnormalities that may wax and wane over many years. Diagnosis is generally made by means of observation of the clinical course in conjunction with a neurologic examination and laboratory tests. These tests may include magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spine, lumbar puncture, and evoked potentials.

The frequency of relapses can be reduced with interferon 13 (Betaseron).

3008	SARS CoV 2, a member of the coronavirus family, is responsible for the current COVID 19 worldwide pandemic. We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS CoV 2 RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of additional nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2' or 3' modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses' exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues with regard to their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and then prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (Carbovir triphosphate, Ganciclovir triphosphate, Stavudine triphosphate, Entecavir triphosphate, 3' O methyl UTP and Biotin 16 dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2' O methyl UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2' fluoro dUTP, 2' amino dUTP and Desthiobiotin 16 UTP). The coronavirus genomes encode an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2' OH group to excise mismatched bases at the 3' terminus. In this study, all of the nucleoside triphosphate analogues we evaluated form Watson Cricklike base pairs. All the nucleotide analogues which demonstrated termination either lack a 2' OH, have a blocked 2' OH, or show delayed termination. These nucleotides may thus have the potential to resist exonuclease activity, a property that we will investigate in the future. Furthermore, prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Brincidofovir/Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA approved for other viral infections, and their safety profile is well known. Thus, they can be evaluated rapidly as potential therapies for COVID 19.	0

3010	In this paper, we compare and evaluate different testing protocols used for automatic COVID 19 diagnosis from X Ray images. We show that similar results can be obtained using X Ray images that do not contain most of the lungs. We are able to remove them from the images by turning to black the center of the scan. Hence, we deduce that several testing protocols for the recognition are not fair and that the neural networks are learning patterns in the images that are not correlated to the presence of COVID 19. We propose a new testing protocol that consists in using different datasets for training and testing, and we provide a method to measure how fair is a specific testing protocol. We suggest to follow the proposed protocol in the future research, and provide tools to better interpret the results of a classifier.	0

3012	The coronavirus disease 2019 has become a public health emergency of international concern affecting 201 countries and territories around the globe. As of April 4, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 11,16,643 confirmed infections and more than 59,170 reported deaths worldwide. The main focus of this paper is two fold: (a) generating short term (real time) forecasts of the future COVID 19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID 19 for some profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and Wavelet based forecasting model that can generate short term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as an early warning system for government policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly affect the case fatality rates for different countries. This data driven analysis will necessarily provide deep insights countries.	0
3013	COVID 19 has infected more than 823,000 people globally and resulted in over 40,000 deaths as of April 1, 2020. Swift government response to contain the outbreak requires accurate and continuous census of the infected population, particularly with regards to viral carriers without severe symptoms. We take on this task by converting the symptom onset time distribution, which we calibrated, into the percentage of the latent, pre symptomatic and symptomatic groups through a novel mathematical procedure. We then estimate the reduction of the basic reproduction number 0 under specific disease control practices such as contact tracing, testing, social distancing, wearing masks and staying at home. When these measures are implemented in parallel, their effects on 0 multiply. For example, if 70% of the general public wear masks and contact tracing is conducted at 60% efficiency within a 4 day time frame, epidemic growth will be flattened in the hardest hit countries. Finally, we analyze the bell shaped curves of epidemic evolution from various affected regions and point out the significance of a universal decay rate of −0.32/day in the final eradication of the disease.	0

3016	The possibility to use widespread and simple chest X ray (CXR) imaging for early screening of COVID 19 patients is attracting much interest from both the clinical and the AI community. In this study we provide insights and also raise warnings on what is reasonable to expect by applying deep learning to COVID classification of CXR images. We provide a methodological guide and critical reading of an extensive set of statistical results that can be obtained using currently available datasets. In particular, we take the challenge posed by current small size COVID data and show how significant can be the bias introduced by transfer learning using larger public non COVID CXR datasets. We also contribute by providing results on a medium size COVID CXR dataset, just collected by one of the major emergency hospitals in Northern Italy during the peak of the COVID pandemic. These novel data allow us to contribute to validate the generalization capacity of preliminary results circulating in the scientific community. Our conclusions shed some light into the possibility to effectively discriminate COVID using CXR.	0

The aim of this work is to describe the 2017 2018 influenza season and how it affected elderly population in Catalonia despite moderate vaccine coverage among this age group. Methods: Influenza surveillance based on a primary care sentinel surveillance, virological indicators systematic sampling of ILI attended and severe influenza confirmed cases (SHLCI) admitted to hospital. Analysis of data by Chi squared, ANOVA, multiple regression and negative control test or case to case for vaccine effectiveness assessment in primary care and SHLCI respectively. Results: Moderate high intensity and early onset season with predominance of influenza B virus (IVB) (63%) followed by an increase of circulation of influenza A virus (IVA). A total of 419 IV from primary care samples. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) in primary care setting was 14% (95%CI: 0 47%). 1306 severe cases (adjusted cumulative incidence 18.54/100,000 inhabitants (95%CI: 17.54 19.55)). The highest proportion of severe cases were in the >64 (65.1%) (aOR 15.70; 95%CI: 12.06 20.46; p < 0.001) followed by 45 64 yo (25.4%) (aOR 6.03; 95%CI: 4.57 7.97).
VE in preventing intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 35% (95%CI: 10 54%). Final outcome death while hospitalized occurred in 175 SHLCI cases with a case fatality rate of 13.4%.
Conclusions: 2017 2018 influenza season was an unusual epidemic season with an early onset, great predominance of influenza B (Yamagata strain) virus with a high hospitalization rate of severe cases among elderly stressing the need to upgrade vaccine uptake in this age group.

Methods We retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0 16 years) with confirmed COVID 19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China. We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features.
were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D dimer, and creatine kinase MB. All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation. Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days. By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured.
Interpretation Although all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID 19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community acquired infections."	0

3024	More and more countries show a significant slowdown in the number of new COVID 19 infections due to effective governmentally instituted lockdown and social distancing measures. We have analyzed the growth behavior of the top 25 most affected countries by means of a local slope analysis and found three distinct patterns that individual countries follow depending on the strictness of the lockdown protocols: exponential rise and fall, power law, or logistic. For countries showing power law growth we have determined the scaling exponents. For countries that showed a strong slowdown in the rate of infections we have extrapolated the expected saturation of the number of infections and the expected final date. Two different extrapolation methods (logistic and parabolic) were used. Both methods agree on the order of magnitude of saturation and end dates. Global infections rates are analyzed with the same methods. The relevance and accuracy of these extrapolations is discussed.	0

3026	"This paper presents a prediction of the total number of ICU and regular beds that will be needed during the pandemic COVID 19 for Bogotá Colombia. We use a SEIR model that includes three different compartments of infection: those who can stay at home, those in regular hospital beds and those in need of ICU treatment. The model allows for a time varying transmission rate which we use to incorporate the measures introduced by the government over the period of one year. The model predicts that by mid July 2020, the city will reach the peak of the epidemic with a total of 22 526 prevalent ICUs needed and 84 816 regular hospital beds needed. By the end of May 2020, the number of patients that need ICUs will overpass the current capacity set at 2000 beds for ICU hospital beds in the city. The model predicts that the death toll by the same date will reach 1752 people and the number of cases will be 54652 inhabitants by then.

Since the spread of the pandemic to our hospitals, we have had to shift our teaching material toward less cerebral topics such as the logistics of donning personal protective equipment (PPE), implementing and understanding triage algorithms, and teaching topics that require us to learn new information as we prepare to teach.	1
3030	In the absence of other tools, monitoring the effects of protective measures, including social distancing and forecasting the outcome of outbreaks is of immense interest. Real time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic errors in reporting. Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of empirical parameters, which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a master variable, and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic reproduction number, the size of the susceptible population, and the infection rate can be determined. In the SIR model, we derive an explicit single variable differential equation for the evolution of the cumulative number of fatalities. We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and Hubei Province, China follows this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship with the logistic growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the basic reproduction number is less than 2.3. This condition is valid for the outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the separation policy of the infected. For more complex models, with more internal variables, such as the SEIR model, the equations derived from the SIR model remain valid approximately, due to the separation of timescales.	0

3033	Objective: The recent emergence of a new coronavirus, COVID 19, has gained extensive coverage in public media and global news. As of 24 March 2020, the virus has caused viral pneumonia in tens of thousands of people in Wuhan, China, and ten of thousands of cases in 184 other countries and territories. This study explores the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor worldwide interest in this COVID 19 epidemic. GT was chosen as a source of reverse engineering data, given the interest in the topic. Methods: Current data on COVID 19 is retrieved from (GT) using one main search topic: Coronavirus. Geographical settings for GT are worldwideResults: The results show that the highest worldwide peak in the first wave of demand for information was on 31 January 2020. After the first peak, the number of new cases reported daily rose for 6 days. A second wave started on 21 February 2020 after the outbreaks were reported in Italy, with the highest peak on 16 March 2020. The second wave is six times as big as the first wave. The number of new cases reported daily is rising day by day.

3037	"The current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 has focused the attention of medical care providers away from non life threatening diseases, including infertility. Although infertility does not jeopardize the physical survival of infertile couples, it does jeopardize their future quality of life. Human infertility can be caused by a number of factors, some of which are age dependent, and their effects may become irreversible if appropriate measures are not taken in time to prevent irreversible childlessness. Accordingly, each case of infertility should be evaluated comprehensively to establish its position of priority. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) makes it possible to separate fertilization and pregnancy in time. Whereas pregnant women infected with coronavirus may have an increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes, gametes do not transmit COVID 19. Thus, performing ovarian stimulation and fertilization without delay, freezing the resulting embryos and delaying embryo transfer until the end of the pandemic appears to be the best strategy at present.

Mathematical models can help define the scale of an epidemic and the rate at which an infection can spread in a community.

Our results indicate that Pakistan could hit peak number of infectious cases on May 26th, 2020 and by June 24th, 2020, 90% of the population will have become infected with the virus if policy interventions seeking to curb this infection are not adopted aggressively.

To facilitate responses to SARS CoV 2, we generated a publicly accessible database of epitopes predicted to bind any class I HLA protein across the entire SARS CoV 2 proteome. While a subset of epitopes from earlier betacoronaviruses, such as SARS CoV (SARS), have been validated experimentally, validation systems are often biased toward specific HLA haplotypes (notably HLA A*02:01) that only account for a fraction of the haplotypes of individuals affected by the SARS CoV 2 pandemic. To enable evaluation of epitopes across individuals with a variety of HLA haplotypes, we computed the predicted binding affinities between 9 mer peptides derived from the annotated SARS CoV 2 peptidome across 9,360 MHC class I HLA A,  B, and  C alleles. There were 6,748 unique combinations of peptides and HLA alleles (pMHCs) with a predicted binding affinity of less than 500nM, including 1,103 unique peptides and 1,022 HLA alleles, spanning 11 annotated superfamilies. These peptides were derived from all 11 proteins spanning the SARS CoV 2 peptidome, including peptides that have previously been validated experimentally.

Predictions of the further course of the epidemic are decisive to deploy targeted disease control measures. We consider a network based model to describe the 2019 nCoV epidemic in the Hubei province. The network is composed of the cities in Hubei and their interactions (e.g., traffic flow). However, the precise interactions between cities is unknown and must be inferred from observing the epidemic. We propose a network based method to predict the future prevalence of the 2019 nCoV virus in every city. Our results indicate that network based modelling is beneficial for an accurate forecast of the epidemic outbreak.	1
3042	In this paper we develop an agent based model for a fine grained computational simulation of the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic in Australia. This model is calibrated to reproduce several characteristics of COVID 19 transmission, accounting for its reproductive number, the length of incubation and generation periods, age dependent attack rates, and the growth rate of cumulative incidence during a sustained and unmitigated local transmission. An important calibration outcome is the age dependent fraction of symptomatic cases, with this fraction for children found to be one fifth of such fraction for adults. We then apply the model to compare several intervention strategies, including restrictions on international air travel, case isolation, social distancing with varying levels of compliance, and school closures. School closures are not found to bring decisive benefits, unless coupled with high level of social distancing compliance. We report an important transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in the range between 70% and 80% levels. This suggests that a compliance of below 70% is unlikely to succeed for any duration of social distancing, while a compliance at the 90% level is likely to control the disease within 13 restrictions.	0

3047	We need an effective treatment to cure COVID 19 patients and to decrease virus carriage duration. Methods: We conducted an uncontrolled non comparative observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU). Results: All patients improved clinically except one 86 year old patient who died, and one 74 year old patient still in intensive care. A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8. Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% of patients at Day5. Consequently patients were able to be rapidly discharged from IDU with a mean length of stay of five days. Conclusion: We believe there is urgency to evaluate the effectiveness of this potentially life saving therapeutic strategy at a larger scale, both to treat and cure patients at an early stage before irreversible severe respiratory complications take hold and to decrease duration of carriage and avoid negligible.	0

3058	"Effective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV) require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor viral spread and immune responses. However, little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019 nCoV is available. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses, including SARS CoV, which has high sequence similarity to 2019 nCoV, and is the best characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019 nCoV that have high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019 nCoV. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019 nCoV.
We identified potential targets for immune responses to 2019 nCoV and provide essential information for understanding human immune responses to this virus and evaluation of diagnostic and vaccine candidates."	1
3059	"Background COVID 19 is a disease with global public health emergency that have shook the world since its' first detection in China in December, 2019. Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is the pathogen responsible behind this pandemic. The lethality of different viral strains is found to vary in different geographical locations but the molecular mechanism is yet to be known.
Methods Available data of whole genome sequencing of different viral strains published by different countries were retrieved and then analysed using Multiple Sequence Alignment and Pair wise Sequence Alignment leading to Phylogenetic tree construction. Each location and the corresponding genetic variations were screened in depth. Then the variations are analysed at protein level giving special emphasis on Non Synonymous amino acid substitutions. The fatality rates in different countries were matched against the mutation number, rarity of the nucleotide alterations and functional impact of the Non Synonymous changes at protein level, separately and in combination.
All the viral strains have been found to evolve from the viral strain of Taiwan (MT192759) which is 100% identical with the ancestor SARS CoV 2 sequences of Wuhan (NC 045512.2; submitted on 5 th Jan, 2020). Transition from C to T (C>T) is the most frequent mutation in this viral genome and mutations A>T, G>A, T>A are the rarest ones, found in countries with maximum fatality rate i.e Italy, Spain and Sweden. 20 Non Synonymous mutations are located in viral genome spanning Orf1ab polyprotein, Surface glycoprotein, Nucleocapsid protein etc. The functional effect on the structure and function of the protein can favourably or unfavourably interact with the host body.
Interpretation The fatality outcome depends on three important factors (a) number of mutation (b) rarity of the allelic variation and (c) functional consequence of the mutation at protein level. The molecular divergence, evolved from the ancestral strain (S) lead to extremely lethal (E), lethal(L) and non lethal (N) strains with the involvement of an Intermediate strain(I)."	0

3061	"As COVID 19 is rapidly spreading across the globe, short term modeling forecasts provide timecritical information for decisions on containment and mitigation strategies. A main challenge for short term forecasts is the assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change as first governmental intervention measures are showing an effect. By combining an established epidemiological model with Bayesian inference, we analyze the time dependence of the effective growth rate of new infections. For the case of COVID 19 spreading in Germany, we detect change points in the effective growth rate that correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions. Thereby, we can (a) quantify the effects of recent governmental measures to mitigating the disease spread, and (b) incorporate the corresponding change points to forecast future scenarios and case numbers. Our code is freely available and can be readily adapted to any country or region.

3063	"Risk of COVID 19 infection in Wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID 19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore.
We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22%  64%) of Singapore's capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5  4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22%  67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18%  68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0%  42%). Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers .

We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% ( 95% HPDI 22%  64%) of Singapore's capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5  4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore, which leads to 1.8 (95% CI 0.5  3.4) undetected cases per detected case. The ability to detect imported cases among high surveillance countries is 40% (95% HPDI 22%  67%), among intermediate surveillance countries it is 37% (95% HPDI 18%  68%), and among low surveillance countries it is 11% (95% HPDI 0%  42%). : medRxiv preprint 7
In this paper, we have aimed to test two assumptions underlying the estimation of incidence at the epicentre of the SARS Cov2 outbreak. The first of these is that the capacity for detection of international imported cases is 100% sensitive and specific across locations. While we know of no reason to doubt specificity of detection, we tested the assumption of perfect sensitivity. Based on our previous estimates 5 we assumed Singapore has the highest capacity of surveillance with respect to COVID 19. We regressed the cumulative cases against Wuhan to location air travel volume considering Singapore to have the greatest detection capacity and estimating the relative underdetection compared to Singapore in the remaining 190 locations classified according to the GHS 2 index 9 . While it is unlikely that this index reflects the true ranking of countries for any specific epidemic, such as the current one of COVID 19, we assume that it captures different levels of surveillance capacity. We therefore grouped the remaining locations into three big classes high, medium, and low surveillance capacity instead of using exact ranking.
We estimated that detection of exported cases from Wuhan worldwide is 38% (95% HPDI 22% 64%) as sensitive as it has been in Singapore. Put another way, this implies that the true number of cases in travelers is at least 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5  4.4) times the number that has been detected.
Equivalently, for each detected case there are at least 1.8 (95% CI 0.5 3.4) undetected cases. If the model is correct, this is an upper bound on the detection frequency because (1) Singapore's detection is probably not 100% efficient. Singapore had as of 12 February 2020 eight"	0
3064	COVID 19 is an emerging respiratory infectious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS CoV 2. It was first reported on in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China and within three month spread as a pandemic around the whole globe. Here, we study macro epidemiological patterns along the time course of the pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID 19 cases and deaths for countries worldwide and for counties in the US, and provide prima facie evidence that both distributions follow a power law over five orders of magnitude. We are able to explain the origin of this scaling behavior as a dual scale process: the large scale spread of the virus between countries and the small scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power law is determined by the ratio of large scale to smallscale growth rates. We confirm this theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta population model, describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our theory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID 19 cases occurred within a few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the outbreak. Assessing how well a simple dual scale model predicts the early spread of epidemics, despite the huge contrasts between countries, could help identify critical temporal threats.	0
3065	In the current COVID 19 pandemic context, proposing and validating effective treatments represents a major challenge. However, the lack of biologically relevant pre clinical experimental models of SARS CoV 2 infection as a complement of classic cell lines represents a 35 major barrier for scientific and medical progress. Here, we advantageously used human reconstituted airway epithelial models of nasal or bronchial origin to characterize viral infection kinetics, tissue level remodeling of the cellular ultrastructure and transcriptional immune signatures induced by SARS CoV 2. Our results underline the relevance of this model for the preclinical evaluation of antiviral candidates. Foremost, we provide evidence on the antiviral 40 efficacy of remdesivir and the therapeutic potential of the remdesivir diltiazem combination as a rapidly available option to respond to the current unmet medical need imposed by COVID 19. : bioRxiv preprint 65 reported the advantage of using more 9) .

Psiquiat., vol. 40 / No. 4 / 2011 Estacionalidad de la esquizofrenia: hallazgos de un estudio descriptivo ejecutado en Santa Marta, Colombia
Introducción: A partir de múltiples estudios ejecutados alrededor del planeta, se ha concluido la existencia de un efecto estacional en los nacimientos de los pacientes que luego desarrollan esquizofrenia. Por ello se ha propuesto una relación entre la exposición a ciertos agentes infecciosos durante el periodo prenatal y posibles efectos directos sobre el cerebro en desarrollo que luego se expresarán con el cuadro clínico clásico. Objetivo: Analizar el comportamiento de los nacimientos de una muestra de individuos esquizofrénicos provenientes de Santa Marta, Colombia. Métodos: Estudio descriptivo basado en la revisión de historias clínicas de los pacientes atendidos en una institución psiquiátrica de la ciudad. Discusión: Se evidenció un mayor número de nacimientos durante los meses más lluviosos del año, lo que sugiere un probable efecto estacional; sin embargo, la ausencia de los datos de nacimientos de individuos en Santa Marta durante los años estudiados impidió comparar los resultados del estudio con las tasas de nacimiento de la población general. Aun así, estos hallazgos tienen implicaciones para las futuras investigaciones respecto a la estacionalidad de la esquizofrenia en Colombia. No reflejan algún riesgo individual para el desarrollo de la enfermedad, pero sí documentan las características del comportamiento temporal de los nacimientos de la muestra estudiada. Nuevos estudios que obvien las limitaciones del presente deben desarrollarse.

Materials and Methods: Study sample consisted of 80 patients diagnosed as COVID 19 from January to February 2020. The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed and the relationship between them was analyzed. Results: Totally 80 patients diagnosed with COVID 19 were included. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 58/80 (73%) of patients had cough, 61/80 (76%) of patients had high temperature levels. The most frequent CT abnormalities observed were ground glass opacity (GGO) (73/80 cases, 91%), consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%) and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%). Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12±6 lung segments involved. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%) and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%). The average pulmonary inflammation index (PII) value was (34%±20%) for all the patients. Correlation analysis showed that the PII value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, C reactive protein, procalcitonin, days from illness onset and body temperature (p<0.05). Conclusion: The common chest CT findings of COVID 19 are multiple GGO, consolidation and interlobular septal thickening in both lungs, which are mostly distributed under the pleura. There are significant correlations between the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the main clinical symptoms and laboratory results. CT plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of this emerging global health emergency.

COVID 19 alone has a great potential to overwhelm the health system. If it was accompanied by dengue fever, this burden would be even greater.
Brazil is making every effort to keep the number of COVID 19 cases from rising. However, a proportion of patients have been not diagnosed due to the insufficiency of specific tests. According to recent studies, many infected cases were not documented, thereby accelerating the spread of SARS CoV 2 [6].
Therefore, to contain the epidemic, large investments in research are required to gain an insight into the epidemiology, transmission, and incubation period of COVID 19, and develop tests, vaccines, and medicines. In response to COVID 19, the Brazilian Government has declared a state of emergency, allowing cities to take extraordinary measures. For example, based on the Annual Budget Law, more than R$ 5 billion will be dedicated to combating the outbreak of COVID 19. Intensified surveillance, resources, and viral identification assays should be urgently prioritized to detect COVID 19 cases and to limit transmission. A combination of these measures may help to increase reporting of these cases, thus slowing down the spread of the COVID 19 outbreak.

3070	Currently, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is a big threat to global health. Rapid spread of the virus has created pandemic, and countries all over the world are struggling with a surge in COVID 19 infected cases. Scientists are working on estimating or predicting infection trajectory for the COVID 19 confirmed cases, which will be useful for future planning and policymaking to effectively cope with the disease. There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or This motivates the use of data integration, combining data from diverse sources and eliciting useful information with a unified view of them. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that integrates global data to estimate COVID 19 infection trajectories. Due to information borrowing across multiple countries, the proposed growth curve models provide a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. They outperform the existing individual country based models. Additionally, we use countrywide covariates to adjust infection trajectories. A joint variable selection technique has been integrated into the proposed modeling scheme, which aimed to identify the possible countrylevel risk factors for severe disease due to COVID 19.	1
3071	"Recently, a wide array of epidemiological models have been developed to guide public health 23 actors in containing the rapid dissemination of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome 24 coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2), cause of COVID 19. Despite their usefulness, many 25 epidemiological models recently developed to understand the spread of SARS CoV 2 and 26 infection rates of COVID 19 fall short as they ignore human mobility, limiting our understanding 27 of the spread of the disease, together with the vulnerability of population centers in a broad scale. 28
We developed a new temporally explicit model and simulated several social distancing scenarios 29 to predict the vulnerability to COVID 19 of 50 Mexican cities that are interconnected by their air 30 transportation network. Additionally, we assessed the sufficiency of the public health 31 infrastructure in the focal cities to face the pandemic over time. Based on our model, we show 32 that the most important cities within the Mexican air transportation network are the most 33 vulnerable to COVID 19, with all assessed public health infrastructure being insufficient to face 34 the modeled scenario for the pandemic after 100 days. Despite these alarming findings, our 35 results show that social distancing could dramatically decrease the total number of infected 36 people (77% drop off for the 45% distancing scenario when contrasted with no distancing), 37 flattening the growth of infection rate. Thus, we consider that this study provides useful 38 information that may help decision makers to timely implement health policies to anticipate and 39 lessen the impact of the current pandemic in Mexico. 40 .

La diffusion, sur un mode quasi pandémique, du cannabis chez les adolescents et adultes jeunes, spécialement en France, justifie l'attention portée aux conséquences, non seulement aiguës, mais également différées de cette intoxication. Dans cette dernière éventualité interviennent des mécanismes épigénétiques. On rappellera d'abord différents types de modifications épigénétiques portant soit sur les histones de la chromatine, principalement des méthylations ou des acétylations ; soit sur l'ADN, par méthylation des cytosines. Des modifications de ce type suscitées par le tétrahydrocannabinol/THC du cannabis peuvent intervenir : soit au niveau des gamètes avant la procréation ; soit sur le foetus pendant la gestation ; soit à différents moments de la vie de l'individu. À certaine de ces modifications épigénétiques est associé un accroissement de la vulnérabilité aux toxicomanies, impliquant les récepteurs D2 de la dopamine dans le noyau accumbens ; une surexpression de la synthèse du précurseur des enképhalines ; des modifications : des récepteurs CB1 des endocannabinoïdes ; des récepteurs de l'acide glutamique ; du GABA ; de protéines impliquées dans la plasticité synaptique, etc. Des modifications épigénétiques peuvent aussi affecter : le système immunitaire ; les activités cognitives ; le développement d'affections psychiatriques en relation avec des perturbations de la maturation cérébrale. Les connaissances qui s'accumulent à cet égard vont à l'opposé de la banalisation ambiante du cannabis. Elles imposent d'alerter les pouvoirs publics et le public, spécialement les jeunes, sur les risques associées à la consommation de cette drogue.
The almost pandemic spread of cannabis among adolescents and young adults, especially in France, justifies the attention given to the consequences, not only acute but also delayed, of this intoxication.
Page 2 of 15 J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 2 In the latter case, epigenetic mechanisms occur. We will first recall various types of epigenetic modifications involving either chromatin histones, mainly methylations or acetylations; either DNA, by methylation of cytosines. Such modifications caused by the tetrahydrocannabinol/THC of cannabis can intervene: either at the level of gametes before procreation, or at different points of the life cycle.
These epigenetic modifications are associated with an increase in vulnerability to drug addiction, involving dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens, overexpression of enkephalin precursor synthesis, modifications of: CB1 receptors of endocannabinoids, glutamic acid receptors, GABA receptors, proteins involved in synaptic plasticity ... These changes can also affect: immune system, cognitive activities, development of psychiatric diseases, related to disturbances of brain maturation.
The knowledge that accumulates in this respect is the opposite of the ambient trivialization of this drug. They impose sending an alert to the public authorities and to the public, especially young people, warning on the risks associated with this drug use and abuse. Page 3 of 15 J o u r n a l P r e  p r o o f 3 Introduction.
En France, le cannabis / chanvre indien, dont l'usage est prohibé par une loi rigoureuse, mais qui n'est pas appliquée, a diffusé dans la population sur un mode d'allure pandémique. On dénombre ainsi 1 400 000 « usagers réguliers ». L'expression « usagers réguliers » correspond à des individus qui troubles, les données qui viennent d'être exposées doivent être communiquées et explicitées, en particulier aux décideurs, à celles et ceux ayant des projets parentaux, aux adolescents et aux éducateurs.

We described the viral detection profile and its association with clinical characteristics in children admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Method: Longitudinal observational retrospective study, with patients aged 0 18 years, admitted to 11 PICUs in Rio de Janeiro, with suspected H1N1 infection, from June to November, 2009. The results of respiratory samples which were sent to the Laboratory of Fiocruz/RJ and clinical data extracted from specific forms were analyzed. Results: Of 71 samples, 38% tested positive for H1N1 virus. Of the 63 samples tested for other viruses, 58 were positive: influenza H1N1 (43.1% of positive samples), rhinovirus/enterovirus (41.4%), respiratory syncytial vírus (12.1%), human metapneumovirus (12.1%), adenovirus

H1N1 positive patients were of a higher median age, had higher frequency of fever, cough and tachypnea, and decreased leukometry when compared to H1N1 negative patients. There was no difference in relation to severity outcomes (number of organic dysfunctions, use of mechanical ventilation or amines, hospital/PICU length of stay or death). Comparing the groups with mono detection and co dection of any virus, no difference was found regarding the association with any clinical variable.

3077	Before molecular and serological diagnostics became widely accessible, detection of pathogens primarily relied on conventional microbiological methods, e.g., cultures on growth media, in cells, and in laboratory animals with further microscopy, identification of antigenic and pathogenic characteristics and the metabolic profile. In summary, the most notable deterrents for clinical metagenomics are: (1) the complexity and high costs of sample preparation, (2) the requirement for special bioinformatic education and skills, (3) the need for a powerful data processing infrastructure and (4) the possible inconsistency between results owing to uneven pathogen distribution in a body and/or quality of sampling. Originally, barcoding—another type of target amplification mediated approach—was developed to assess bacterial associations (e.g., gut microbiota), based on reliable universal phylogenetic markers, such as 16S, where short taxon specific sequences consisting of a variable fragment flanked by conservative fragments are used for tagging organisms.	0

3079	In this paper, we collect and study Twitter communications to understand the socio economic impact of COVID 19 in the United States during the early days of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that COVID 19 gripped the nation during this time as is evidenced by the significant number of trending hashtags. With infections soaring rapidly, users took to Twitter asking people to self isolate and quarantine themselves. Users also demanded closure of schools, bars, and restaurants as well as lockdown of cities and states. The communications reveal the ensuing panic buying and the unavailability of some essential goods, in particular toilet paper. We also observe users express their frustration in their communications as the virus spread continued. We methodically collect a total of 530,206 tweets by identifying and tracking trending COVID related hashtags. We then group the hashtags into six main categories, namely 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying, 4) School Closures, 5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope, and study the temporal evolution of tweets in these hashtags. We conduct a linguistic analysis of words common to all the hashtag groups and specific to each hashtag group. Our preliminary study presents a succinct and aggregated picture of people's response to the pandemic analysis.	0

3081	"Background: COVID 19 threatens to quickly overwhelm our existing critical care infrastructure in the USA. Systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been previously demonstrated to improve PaO 2 /FiO 2 (mmHg) when given to critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is unclear to what extent tPA may impact population based survival during the current US COVID 19 pandemic. Methods: A decision analytic Markov state transition model was created to simulate the life critically ill COVID 19 patients as they transitioned to either recovery or death. Two patient groups were simulated (50,000 patients in each group); (1) Patients received tPA immediately upon diagnosis of ARDS and (2) patients received standard therapy for ARDS. Base case critically ill COVID 19 patients were defined as having a refractory PaO 2 /FiO 2 of < 60 mmHg (salvage use criteria). Transition from severe to moderate to mild ARDS, recovery, and death were estimated. Markov model parameters were extracted from existing ARDS/COVID 19 literature. Results: The use of tPA was associated with reduced mortality (47.6% [tTPA] vs. 71.0% [no tPA]) for base case patients. When extrapolated to the projected COVID 19 eligible for salvage use tPA in the USA, peak mortality (deaths/100,000 patients) was reduced for both optimal social distancing (70.5 [tPA] vs. 75.0 [no tPA]) and no social distancing (158.7 [tPA] vs. 168.8 [no tPA]) scenarios.
Conclusions: Salvage use of tPA may improve recovery of ARDS patients, thereby reducing COVID 19 related mortality and ensuring sufficient resources to manage this pandemic."	0

We quantify the causal impact of human mobility restrictions, particularly the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020, on the containment and delay of the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV). We employ a set of differencein differences (DID) estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect, virus effect, and the Spring Festival effect. We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within Wuhan movements by 54.15%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019 nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases. We find, using simulations with these estimates, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities. We find that the COVID 19 cases would be 64.81% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province, and 52.64% higher in the 16 non Wuhan cities inside Hubei, in the counterfactual world in which the city of Wuhan were not locked down from January 23, 2020. We also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019 nCoV outbreak in Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province, but over time, the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated ""actual"" cases narrows significantly. We also find evidence that enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei province are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019 nCoV virus in the destination cities elsewhere. 3 With a population of over 11 million, Wuhan is the largest city in Hubei, the most populous city in Central China, and the seventh most populous city in China. The city is also a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through and connecting to other major cities, and home to 82 colleges and more than 1 million college students."	0

3085	Understanding Covid 19 lethality and its variation from country to country is essential for supporting governments in the choice of appropriate strategies. Adopting correct indicators to monitor the lethality of the infection in the course of the outbreak is a crucial issue. This works highlights how far the case fatality ratio, as calculated day by day in the course of the outbreak, is a misleading indicator for estimating the fatality rate, even if our attention is only restricted to the subset of confirmed cases. We prove that the final case fatality ratio for several major European countries is bound to largely exceed 10%. The difference in the case fatality ratio values between Italy and other major European countries considered in this work (except for the case of Germany), often interpreted in terms of peculiarities of the Italian population or health system, is to be mostly attributed to the more advanced stage of the Italian epidemic.	0
3086	"Here we present an improved mathematical analysis of the time evolution of the Covid 19 pandemic in Italy and a statistical error analyses of its evolution, including Monte Carlo simulations with a very large number of runs to evaluate the uncertainties in its evolution. A previous analysis was based on the assumption that the number of nasopharyngeal swabs would be constant, however the number of daily swabs has been increasing with an average factor of about five with respect to our previous analysis, Therefore, here we consider the time evolution of the ratio of the diagnosed positive cases to number of swabs, which is more representative of the evolution of the pandemic when the number of swabs is increasing or changing in time. We consider a number of possible distributions representing the evolution of the pandemic in Italy and we test their prediction capability over a period up to four weeks. The results show that a distribution of the type of Planck's black body radiation law provides very good forecasting. The use of different distributions provides an independent estimate of the uncertainty. We then consider five possible cases for the number of daily swabs and we then estimate the potential dates of a substantial reduction in the number of diagnosed positive cases. We then perform Monte Carlo simulations with 25000 runs to evaluate the uncertainty in the prediction of the date of a substantial reduction in the number of diagnosed daily cases. Finally, we present an alternative method to evaluate the uncertainty in our mathematical predictions based on the study of each region of Italy and we present an application of the Central Limit Theorem with 100000 runs to display the uncertainty in our mathematical predictions based on the analysis of each region.

The current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious, and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug. In previous studies, it was found that the conformation change in CTD1 was the region where SARS CoV bound to human ACE2. Although there are mutations of the 2019 nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high. The surface glycoprotein of 2019 nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S protein by comparing the I TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019 nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes. Furthermore, site prediction on the surface glycoprotein of 2019 nCoV suggests some core amino acid area may be a novel drug target against 2019 nCoV.	0

3095	"The epicenter of the original outbreak in China has high male smoking rates of around 50%, and early reported death rates have an emphasis on older males, therefore the likelihood of smokers being overrepresented in fatalities is high. In Iran, China, Italy, and South Korea, female smoking rates are much lower than males. Fewer females have contracted the virus. If this analysis is correct, then Indonesia would be expected to begin experiencing high rates of Covid 19 because its male smoking rate is over 60% (Tobacco Atlas). Smokers are vulnerable to respiratory viruses.
Smoking can upregulate angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, the known receptor for both the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS CoV) and the human respiratory coronavirus NL638. This could also be true for new electronic smoking devices such as electronic cigarettes and ""heat not burn"" IQOS devices. ACE2 could be a novel adhesion molecule for SARS CoV 2 causing Covid 19 and a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of fatal microbial infections, and therefore it should be fast tracked and prioritized for research and investigation. Data on smoking status should be collected on all identified cases of Covid 19.
Little attention has been given to the role of smoking in either the transmission of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2, actual virus) or mortality rate of Covid 19 (name of the disease caused). Smokers contract more respiratory ailments, including colds (commonly rhinoviruses, but also coronaviruses) than non smokers. Smokers also show double the influenza rate and increased rates of bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The damage caused to the lungs by smoking makes patients more susceptible to pulmonary infections, both bacterial and viral [6] . Smokers are 34% more likely than non smokers to contract the flu [6] . Han and colleagues conclude that literature evidence showed that smoking was consistently associated with a higher risk of hospital admissions after influenza infection [7] . Smoking is the primary etiological factor behind chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the developed world, but environmental pollution and degrading air quality are also responsible in developing countries.

3103	Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors mediate the entry into the cell of three strains of coronavirus: SARS CoV, NL63 and SARS CoV 2. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain. ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form. An important salutary function of membrane bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1 7 . Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis. The increased generation of angiotensin 1 7 also triggers counter regulatory protective effects through binding to G protein coupled Mas receptors. Unfortunately, the entry of SARS CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane. Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis. Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS CoV 2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency. We suggest that ACE2 down regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions. The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the 'adverse' ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis and the 'protective' ACE2→Angiotensin 1 7 →Mas receptor axis. In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin 1 7 . In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin 1 7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS CoV 2 infection.	0

A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS CoV 2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed.
Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected.
The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was < 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15 to 39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID 19 patients (p < 0.001), even in early phase of 1 week since onset (p = 0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006).

The literature on the topic is still fragmented; the features of the emerging paradigm appear to be a contested territory among different academic disciplines. This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the experts' comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0. Managers and policymakers can leverage the scenarios in long term strategic planning.	0

We discuss the risk of COVID 19 for epilepsy patients, the effect of COVID 19 on epilepsy patients, and the importance of maintaining seizure control. We also consider suggestions for epilepsy monitoring units or surgery, what caregivers should know, and the importance of public awareness. The effect of COVID 19 on individuals with epilepsy remains unclear due to the lack of enough evidence. Clinicians and researchers need to share case information, families.	0

Patients were classified into four groups, mild, moderate, severe and critically ill. The mean age of our patients was 47 years of age (range 3 85) and there was a slight male predominance (58.7%). Thirty percent of our patients had severe or critically ill disease, but only 20% of severe and 33% of critically ill patients had been to Wuhan. Fever was the most common presentation (84.1%), but cough was present in only slightly over half of the patients. We found that lymphocyte and eosinophils count were significantly decreased in patients with severe disease (p=0.001 and p=0.000, respectively). Eosinopenia was a feature of higher levels of severity. Peripheral CD4 , CD8  T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes were significantly decreased in severe and critically ill patients, but there was only a nonstatistically significant downward trend in NK cell numbers with severity. Of note is that liver function test including AST, ALT, GGT and LDH were elevated, and albumin was decreased.

3119	The recent outbreak of SARS CoV 2 (2019 nCoV) virus has highlighted the need for fast and efficacious vaccine development. Stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to protection is highly dependent on presentation of epitopes to circulating T cells via the HLA complex. SARS CoV 2 is a large RNA virus and testing of all overlapping peptides in vitro to deconvolute an immune response is not feasible. Therefore HLA binding prediction tools are often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. We tested 19 epitope HLA binding prediction tools, and using an in vitro peptide MHC stability assay, we assessed 777 peptides that were predicted to be good binders across 11 MHC allotypes. In this investigation of potential SARS CoV 2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the MHC allotype in question. Designing a COVID 19 vaccine where only a few epitope targets are included is therefore a very challenging task. Here, we present 174 SARS CoV 2 epitopes with high prediction binding scores, validated to bind stably to 11 HLA allotypes. Our findings 19.	0

3124	From 29 to 31 January 2020, a total of 565 Japanese citizens were evacuated from Wuhan, China on three chartered flights. All passengers were screened upon arrival in Japan for symptoms consistent with novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) infection and tested for presence of the virus. Assuming that the mean detection window of the virus can be informed by the mean serial interval (estimated at 7.5 days), the ascertainment rate of infection was estimated at 9.2% (95% confidence interval: 5.0, 20.0). This indicates that the incidence of infection in Wuhan can be estimated at 20,767 infected individuals, including those with asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections. The infection fatality risk (IFR) the actual risk of death among all infected individuals is therefore 0.3% to 0.6%, which may be comparable to Asian influenza pandemic of 1957 1958. 	0
3125	"Background: Mounting evidence suggests that there is an undetected pool of COVID 19 asymptomatic but infectious cases. Estimating the number of asymptomatic infections has been crucial to understand the virus and contain its spread, which is, however, hard to be accurately counted.
Methods: We propose an approach of machine learning based fine grained simulator (ML Sim), which integrates multiple practical factors including disease progress in the incubation period, cross region population movement, undetected asymptomatic patients, and prevention and containment strength. The interactions among these factors are modeled by virtual transmission dynamics with several undetermined parameters, which are determined from epidemic data by machine learning techniques. When MLSim learns to match the real data closely, it also models the number of asymptomatic patients. MLSim is learned from the open Chinese global epidemic data.
Findings: MLSim showed better forecast accuracy than the SEIR and LSTM based prediction models. The MLSim learned from the data of China's mainland reveals that there could have been 150,408 (142,178 157,417) asymptomatic and had self healed patients, which is 65% (64%  65%) of the inferred total infections including undetected ones. The numbers of asymptomatic but infectious patients on April 15, 2020, were inferred as, 215  171,930). To control the virus transmission, the containment measures taken by the government were crucial. The learned MLSim also reveals that if the date of containment measures in China's mainland was postponed for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days later than Jan. 23, there would be 109,039 (129%), 183,930 (218%), 313,342 (371%), 537,555 (637%) confirmed cases on June 12.
Conclusions: Machine learning based fine grained simulators can better model the complex real world disease transmission process, and thus can help decision making of balanced containment measures. The simulator also revealed the potential great number of undetected asymptomatic infections, which poses a great risk to the virus containment. , is a coronavirus and belongs to the same family as the pathogen that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), or SARS [Li et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020] . It causes a respiratory dominated illness and can spread from person to person [Chan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b; Xu et al., 2020].
Asymptomatic cases refer to people who can be tested positive for the coronavirus but develop limited or no symptoms such as fever, cough, or sore throat, noting that they are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others. Mounting evidence suggests that there is an undetected pool of covert asymptomatic cases [Dong et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a]. A recent news [Qiu] published by Nature on March 20, 2020, manifests that there could be 30%  60% patients are asymptomatic or mildly ill cases. Estimating the number of undetected asymptomatic cases has been crucial to containing the spread of the coronavirus, which is, however, hard to be accurately counted. Meanwhile, if we can model how the virus transmits, it is fully possible to make inference on the unobserved number of asymptomatic patients from the observed epidemic data.
There are mainly two ways to model the virus transmission. One way is to employ transmission dynamics to describe how diseases spread. A classical transmission dynamics model is the Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model [Kermack and McKendrick, 1991] that consists of susceptibles, infectives, and recovered individuals, and differential equations about how individuals changes. Variants of SIR models have been studied, such as the SEIR model [Anderson et al., 1992; Lekone and Finkenstädt, 2006] considering the incubation period, which is also significant for COVID 19 infection, and other models considering temporary immunity [Wen and Yang, 2008], passive immunity [Bichara et al., 2014; Qureshi and Yusuf, 2019], etc. These models are grounded in human knowledge about virus infection and immunity, which are good in generalization to long period predictions. At the same time, these models commonly over simply the real world and are hard to fit well the epidemic data, which results in large prediction errors. Another way is to rely on machine learning models. For epidemic data, a type of model that are naturally suitable for the task is the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [Elman, 1990] , with long short term memory (LSTM) [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997] . These models are very flexible that can fit well the epidemic data, and thus can make accurate predictions for the very near future. However, due to the lack of domain knowledge, these models are hard to generalize to long term futures, hard to incorporate different decisions, and hard to be interpretable.
Noticed that combination of human knowledge and learning from data has recently shown powerful in solving sophisticated problems [Zhou, 2019]. To alleviate the above issues of the two types of methods, we propose an approach of machine learning based fine grained simulator (MLSim), which can not only predict the virus transmission more accurately, but also help to estimate the number of asymptomatic patients.
We propose a machine learning based transmission simulator (MLSim) to estimate COVID 19 asymptomatic infections.

To date, despite various strategies to identify CoV interventions, there are only limited therapeutic options available. To address these unmet medical needs, we used a South Korean MERS CoV clinical isolate and screened 5,406 compounds, including US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs and bioactive molecules, confirmed 221 hits by dose response curve analysis in the primary assay, and selected 54 hits with a therapeutic index (TI) greater than 6. Time ofaddition studies with 12 FDA approved drugs demonstrated that eight and four therapeutics act on the early and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Among the early acting drugs, three therapeutics with a TI greater than 100 were cardiotonic agents. Together, our results identify potential therapeutic options for treatment of MERS CoV infections and could provide a basis for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) outbreak.	1

It is a challenge to generate detailed high quality evidence from data while ensuring fast availability and evaluation of the results.
We reviewed all interventional COVID 19 trials on Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine registered in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and summarized the endpoints used to assess treatment effects. We propose a multistate model that harmonizes heterogeneous endpoints and differing lengths of follow up within and between trials.
There are currently, March 27, 2020, 23 registered interventional trials investigating the potential benefits of Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine. The endpoints are highly heterogeneous. Follow up for the primary endpoints ranges from four to 168 days.
A detailed precisely defined endpoint has been proposed by the global network REMAP CAP, which is specialized on community acquired pneumonia. Their seven category endpoint accounts for major clinical events informative for all decision makers. Moreover, the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative is currently working on a core outcome set. We propose a multistate model that accommodates analysis of these recommended endpoints. The model allows for a detailed investigation of treatment effects for various endpoints over the course of time thereby harmonizing differing endpoints and lengths of follow up.
Multistate model analysis is a powerful tool to study clinically heterogeneous endpoints (mortality, discharge) as well as endpoints influencing hospital capacities (duration of hospitalization and ventilation) simultaneously over time. Our proposed model extracts all information available in the data and is  by harmonizing endpoints within and between trials  a step towards faster decision making. All ongoing clinical trials, especially those with severe cases, should accommodate primary analysis with a stacked probability plot of the major events mechanical ventilation, discharge alive and death.

3130	"Background: High rates of concurrent gastrointestinal manifestations have been noted in patients with , however the association between these digestive manifestations and need for hospitalization has not been established.
Methods: Following expedited approval from our Institutional Review Board, we analyzed retrospectively collected data from consecutive patients with confirmed COVID 19 based on a positive polymerase chain reaction testing at our institution from March 03, 2020 to April 7, 2020. Baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory and patient reported symptom data were collected at presentation in the emergency room. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between hospitalization and presence of gastrointestinal symptoms.
Results: During this study period, we identified 207 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID 19.
34.5% noted concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms; of which 90% of gastrointestinal symptoms were mild. In a multivariate regression model controlled for demographics and disease severity, an increased risk for hospitalization was noted in patients with any gastrointestinal symptom (adjusted OR 4.84 95% CI: 1.68 13.94]. Diarrhea was associated with a seven fold higher likelihood for hospitalization (adjusted OR=7.58, 95% CI: 2.49 20.02, P <0.001) and nausea or vomiting had a four times higher odds. (adjusted OR 4.39, 95% CI: 1.61 11.4, P = 0.005).
Conclusion: We demonstrate that a significant portion of COVID19 patients have concurrent mild gastrointestinal symptoms and that the presence of these digestive symptoms is associated with a need for hospitalization. With the current focus on streamlining triaging efforts, first responders and frontline providers should consider assessing for digestive symptoms in their initial clinical evaluation and decision making."	0

At the same time, the publicity of all kinds of big data also provides the possibility to explore the impact of media information diffusion on disease transmission.

The SIR dynamics are expressed using Itô stochastic differential equations. We first derive the parameters of the model from the available daily data from European regions based on a 24 day history of infections, recoveries and deaths. The derived parameters have been aggregated to project future trends for the Indian subcontinent, which is currently at an early stage in the infection cycle. The projections are meant to serve as a guideline for strategizing the socio political counter measures to mitigate COVID 19.	0

3135	"The COVID 19 outbreak is triggering a global crisis that is challenging governments, health systems and the scientific community worldwide 1 . A central question in the COVID 19 pandemic is whether climatic factors modulate its progression. This information is key to epidemiologists and healthcare decision makers for improving their management plans 2 .
Previous attempts to assess the impact of climatic parameters have yielded ambiguous results, either because they were using geographically or temporally restricted data, or because they were comparing infection rates across countries, which were measured differently depending on local screening strategies. In March 2020, the spread of COVID 19 dramatically increased the number of countries recording deaths 3 , providing an opportunity to use mortality rate, which is measured more homogeneously across countries than infection rates, as a descriptor of the COVID 19 outbreak over a large latitudinal range. Here, using data recorded in 208 territories from 88 countries, we show that mortality rate is negatively influenced by warmer air temperature and positively affected by higher relative humidity. Each additional Celsius degree decreases mortality rate by ~4%, while a 1% increase in relative humidity raises .

We also show that other factors contribute to the dynamics of the COVID 19 outbreak, such as the proportion of vulnerable age classes in the population, access to a non overwhelmed health system, as well as governmental travel restrictions for controlling the spread of the disease. All of them are critical factors impacting the mortality rate of COVID 19. The influence of climatic factors is a warning to all southern hemisphere countries where winter is coming soon. Northern hemisphere countries should also be warned that climatic factors alone will likely not be sufficient to contain the disease."	0

Our result shows that the basic reproductive number of SARS CoV 2 in host growth is around 3.79. Using the same method we also estimate the basic reproductive number of MERS virus is 8.16 which is higher than SARS CoV 2.

To facilitate future research, we aimed to assess the set of key metrics currently used by researchers in these settings and to propose a set of standard metrics to facilitate future research. Methods: Systematic literature review of 43,109 published reports on general emergency care from 139 LMICs. Studies describing care for subsets of emergency conditions, subsets of populations, and data aggregated across multiple facilities were excluded. All facility and patient level statistics reported in these studies were recorded and the most commonly used metrics were identified. Results: We identified 195 studies on emergency care delivery in LMICs. There was little uniformity in either patient or facility level metrics reported. Patient demographics were inconsistently reported: only 33% noted average age and 63% the gender breakdown. The upper age boundary used for paediatric data varied widely, from 5 to 20 years of age. Emergency centre capacity was reported using a variety of metrics including annual patient volume (n = 175, 90%); bed count (n = 60, 31%), number of rooms (n = 48, 25%); frequently none of these metrics were reported (n = 16, 8%). Many characteristics essential to describe capabilities and performance of emergency care were not reported, including use and type of triage; level of provider training; admission rate; time to evaluation; and length of EC stay. Conclusion: We found considerable heterogeneity in reporting practices for studies of emergency care in LMICs. Standardised metrics could facilitate future analysis and interpretation of such studies, and expand the ability to generalise and compare findings across emergency care settings."	0
3142	"The current COVID 19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shortage of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) in hospitals around the globe [1] . One component of PPE that is in particular demand are disposable N95 face masks. To alleviate this, many methods of N95 mask sterilization have been studied and proposed with the hope of being able to safely reuse masks [2] . Two major considerations must be made when re sterilizing masks: (1) the sterilization method effectively kills pathogens, penetrating into the fibers of the mask, and (2) the method does not degrade the operational integrity of the N95 filters.
We studied Cobalt 60 ( 60 Co) gamma irradiation as a method of effective sterilization without inducing mask degradation. Significant literature exists supporting the use of gamma radiation as a sterilization method, with viral inactivation of SARS CoV reported at doses of at most 10 kGy [3] , with other studies supporting 5 kGy for many types of viruses [4] . However, concerns have been raised about the radiation damaging the fiber material within the mask, specifically by causing cross linking of polymers, leading to cracking and degradation during fitting and/or deployment [5, 6] .
A set of 3M 8210 and 9105 masks were irradiated using MIT's 60 Co irradiator. Three masks of each type received 0 kiloGray (kGy), 10 kGy and 50 kGy of approximately 1.3 MeV gamma radiation from the circular cobalt sources, at a dose rate of 2.2kGy per hour.
Following this sterilization procedure, the irradiated masks passed a OSHA Gerson Qualitative Fit Test QLFT 50 (saccharin apparatus) [7] when donned correctly, performed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, in a blinded study repeated in triplicate. However, the masks' filtration of 0.3 µm particles was significantly degraded, even at 10 kGy.
These results suggest against gamma, and possibly all ionizing radiation, as a method of disposable N95 sterilization. Even more importantly, they argue against using the qualitative fit test alone to assess mask integrity."	0

3145	"Since 2002, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS CoV in 2002, MERS CoV in 2012, and the recent outbreak of SARS CoV 2 late in 2019 (also named as COVID 19 or novel coronavirus 2019 or nCoV2019. Spike(S) protein, one of the structural proteins of this virus plays key role in receptor (ACE2) binding and thus virus entry. Thus, this protein has attracted scientists for detailed study and therapeutic targeting. As the 2019 novel coronavirus takes its course throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are been done and genome sequences getting deposited in various databases. From India two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome deposited in GenBank. We have performed sequence analyses of the spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of the two isolates one was found to harbour a mutation in its Receptor binding domain (RBD) at position 407. At this site arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was
replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C beta branched amino acid). This mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor ding of the virus. Although this finding needs further validation and more sequencing, the information might be useful in rational drug designing permission."	0

3153	The infectious diseases are spreading due to human interactions enabled by various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS CoV 2 causes an outbreak, the non pharmaceutical isolation policies (e.g., social distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. Since there exist several non pharmaceutical strategies to resort to, we need to assess their efficiency for thwarting the pandemic impact. To this end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized (C), decentralized (D), and combined (C D) social distancing strategies, and analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID 19 on heterogeneous complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized policy is insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with the centralized one. Indeed, the (C D) policy is the most efficient isolation at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that a moderate social distancing, e.g., cutting 50% of social ties, can reduce the outbreak impact by 47% for the C isolation, and by 31% for the D isolation. A stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for the (C D) isolation. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a region) can have dangerous effects. Thus, our study contributes to an understanding of the COVID 19 pandemic both in space (i.e., networkcentric analysis of isolation strategies), and time (i.e., delayed application of isolation strategies). We believe our investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID 19 pandemic easier to understand and control over an extended period.	0

3155	Many detection methods have been used or reported for the diagnosis and/or surveillance of SARS CoV 2. Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) is the most sensitive, claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47 59% of the positive cases were identified by RT PCR, probably due to loss or degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or even mutation of the virus genome. Therefore, developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodate various application settings, we developed a multiplex PCR based method comprised of 172 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrated its efficiency to detect SARS CoV 2 at low copy numbers. The assay produced clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allowed for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. In addition, optional sequencing can provide further confirmation as well as phylogenetic information of the identified virus(es) for specific strain discrimination, which will be of paramount importance for surveillance purposes that represent a global health imperative. Finally, we also developed in parallel a multiplex PCR based metagenomic method that is amenable to detect SARS CoV 2, with the additional benefit of its potential for uncovering mutational diversity and novel pathogens at low sequencing depth.	0

3163	Hundred viruses can be isolated in patients suffering from respiratory virus infections and hospitalised in intensive care unit (ICU): influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus… Nasal or tracheobronchial specimens, which contain many epithelial cells will be used to isolate these common viruses. In immunocompromised patients a bronchoalveolar lavage has to be added to these specimens in order to detect cytomegalovirus and some adenovirus. The immunofluorescence or immunoenzymatic assays, which detect viral antigens in the infected cells are the easiest and fastest diagnostic methods, theoretically. As with other techniques, specimen quality is a major determinant of their performance. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of the antigen detection assays is low in respiratory infections in adults. Then the virus recovery by cell culture, which is usually more sensitive than the antigen detection assays, can be helpful. Many studies have reported more respiratory virus detections using nucleic acid testing such as PCR. They detect viruses, which are missed by conventional methods and increase the detection of common respiratory virus. Multiplex PCR assays have been developed, and these can simultaneously detect several viruses directly in clinical specimens. Nucleic acid testing can subtype viruses using subtype specific primers, and analyse strain variation through genetic. It can be used also to quantify the viral load in clinical specimens. More recently real time RT PCR assays have been developed to get more rapidly the results of the nucleic acids assays. Specimen quality, timing and transportation conditions may be less critical for nucleic acid testing than for culture or antigen detection, as viable virus and intact infected cells need not to be preserved. Moreover, viral nucleic acids are detectable for several days longer into the clinical course than is cultivable virus, potentially allowing a diagnosis to be made in late presenting patients. However, in a clinical virology laboratory, where the speed, low cost, and high sensitivity of the methods are required, the sequential use of antigen detection tests and multiplex PCR could be the best choice, particularly in the clinical setting of respiratory virus infections in adults hospitalised in ICU. In the future, the development of real time multiplex PCR is likely to be top priority. © 2007 Société de réanimation de langue française. Publié par Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits réservés.	0

Industry 4.0 is known as the fourth industrial revolution, which has the potential to fulfil customised requirement during COVID 19 crisis. This revolution has started with the applications of advance manufacturing and digital information technologies. Methods: A detailed review of the literature is done on the technologies of Industry 4.0 and their applications in the COVID 19 pandemic, using appropriate search words on the databases of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate. Results: We found several useful technologies of Industry 4.0 which help for proper control and management of COVID 19 pandemic and these have been discussed in this paper. The available technologies of Industry 4.0 could also help the detection and diagnosis of COVID 19 and other related problems and symptoms. Conclusions: Industry 4.0 can fulfil the requirements of customised face masks, gloves, and collect information for healthcare systems for proper controlling and treating of COVID 19 patients. We have discussed ten major technologies of Industry 4.0 which help to solve the problems of this virus. It is useful to provide day to day update of an infected patient, area wise, age wise and state wise with proper surveillance systems. We also believe that the proper implementation of these technologies would help to enhance education and communication regarding public health. These Industry 4.0 technologies could provide a lot of innovative ideas and solution for fighting local and global medical emergencies.	0
3166	"As the pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) rages throughout the world, accurate modeling of the dynamics thereof is essential. However, since the availability and quality of data varies dramatically from region to region, accurate modeling directly from a global perspective is difficult, if not altogether impossible. Nevertheless, via local data collected by certain regions, it is possible to develop accurate local prediction tools, which may be coupled to develop global models.
In this study, we analyze the dynamics of local outbreaks of COVID 19 via a coupled system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Utilizing the large amount of data available from the ebbing outbreak in Hubei, China as a testbed, we estimate the basic reproductive number, R0 of COVID 19 and predict the total cases, total deaths, and other features of the Hubei outbreak with a high level of accuracy. Through numerical experiments, we observe the effects of quarantine, social distancing, and COVID 19 testing on the dynamics of the outbreak. Using knowledge gleaned from the Hubei outbreak, we apply our model to analyze the dynamics of outbreak in Turkey.

C X C motif chemokine 17 (CXCL 17) is a novel chemokine that plays a functional role maintaining homeostasis at distinct mucosal barriers, including regulation of myeloid cell recruitment, angiogenesis, and control of microorganisms. Particularly, CXCL17 is produced along the epithelium of the airways both at steady state and under inflammatory conditions. While increased CXCL17 expression is associated with disease progression in pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung/hepatic cancer, it is thought to play a protective role in pancreatic cancer, autoimmune encephalomyelitis and viral infections. Thus, there is emerging evidence pointing to both a harmful and protective role for CXCL17 in human health and disease, with therapeutic potential for translational applications. In this review, we provide an overview of the discovery, characteristics and functions of CXCL17 emphasizing its clinical potential in respiratory disorders.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for an ongoing human pandemic . There is a massive international effort underway to develop diagnostic reagents, vaccines and antiviral drugs in a bid to slow down the spread of the disease and save lives. One part of that international effort involves the research community working with plants, bringing researchers from all over the world together with commercial enterprises in order to achieve the rapid supply of protein antigens and antibodies for diagnostic kits, and scalable production systems for the emergency manufacturing of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Here we look at some of the ways in which plants can and are being used in the fight against COVID 19.
An outbreak of potentially lethal coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has created a pandemic (COVID 19) that provoked governments across the world to introduce emergency containment and control measures. The aim of these measures is to delay the spread of infection, thus reducing the acute pressure on hospital beds, frontline medical staff and resources. Slowing down the rate of infection and thereby reducing the total number of acute cases at any one time can help to prevent the collapse of national healthcare systems. These tactics also give researchers more time to develop effective testing assays to identify carriers, treatments that reduce the severity of symptoms and resolve infections more quickly, and vaccine candidates to protect the unexposed segment of the population. Researchers working on the applications of plants can play a key role during this critical time by using their knowledge and infrastructure as a means to develop and produce new diagnostics and therapeutics. Indeed, plants may offer the only platform that can be used to manufacture such reagents at scale in a timeframe of weeks, compared to months or even years for cell based systems. Here, we look at three areas where plants could make major contributions: diagnostic reagents to identify infected and recovered individuals, vaccines to prevent infection, and antivirals to treat symptoms."	0
3175	"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 continues to expand across the world.
Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID 19
In this observational study, data was collected from two open access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID 19 were defined as patients ≤19 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts.
Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms.
A total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5 15] years. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside China) (p=0.22). While the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in China rapidly decreased from the start point.

The data from this study supports the fact that the CFR of the COVID 19 pandemic seems to be less than Bird flu, Ebola, SARS, and MERS, but public health concerns remain due to its highly infectious nature, since a large proportion of cases are asymptomatic or mild, which promotes the spread of	1
3179	By April 2020, the first wave of COVID 19 outbreak has reached a plateau in some countries, while in other countries it is still increasing exponentially with varying doubling rates, forcing governments to continuously evaluate the situation and adapt the implemented control measures accordingly. Researchers have shown that even simple empirical models stemming from biological growth modeling have the potential to provide useful information on the development and severity of ongoing epidemics since they can be employed as tools for carrying out projections on the size of the affected population, timing of turning points, as well as best and worst case scenarios. Nevertheless, they commonly exhibit considerable sensitivity to some input parameters' variance which results in large fluctuations in the generated projections, thus rendering predictions difficult and even risky. In this work we examine a novel meta projections based approach which allows us to evaluate the model's current trends and assess whether generated projections are at a transient or stable state. Meta projections can be extracted from graphs of successive estimations of model's parameters and resulting projections, over a sequence of days being gradually added to the employed model. In other words, projections are carried out on truncated timeseries of cumulative numbers of confirmed cases with increased lengths at each successive evaluation. This allows us to trace the values of model parameters over a certain period of time and examine their trends which may converge to specific values for well described, settled growth cases or exhibit a changing or even an erratic behavior for cases that undergo epidemiological transitions and/or are inappropriately described by the current model instance(s). We have computed meta projections and compared our findings for countries at different stages of the epidemic with stable or unstable behaviors and increasing or decreasing numbers of confirmed cases. Our results indicate that meta projections can aid researchers in assessing the appropriateness of their relevant models and in effect decrease the uncertainty in their estimations of an epidemic's severity and development.	0

We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since the first importation, however 6 cases out of 10 were estimated to go undetected. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions.	1

Even though children have been reported to be less susceptible to COVID 19 infection (6), we have witnessed considerable psychological implications on them: the shutting down of schools and playgrounds, the restriction of outdoor activities alongside their parents' fears anxiety, such as panic attacks and psychosomatic symptoms.	1
3183	"Estimating the key epidemiological features of the novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) epidemic proves to be challenging, given incompleteness and delays in early data reporting, in particular, the severe under reporting bias in the epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As a result, the current literature reports widely varying estimates. We developed an alternative geostratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city's lockdown on January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications to prioritization of control and prevention efforts.

3184	2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV) is a virus identified as the cause of the outbreak of pneumonia first detected in Wuhan, China. Investigations on the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with this virus are ongoing. Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic antibody to prevent the infection, and more effective immune strategy against the pathogen. In contrast, specific inhibitors targeting the key protease involved in replication and proliferation of the virus are the most effective means to alleviate the epidemic. The main protease of SARS CoV is essential for the life cycle of the virus, which showed 96.1% of similarity with the main proteaseof 2019 nCoV, is considered to be an attractive target for drug development. In this study, we have identified 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with SARS CoV main protease by high throughput screening based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries, all these drugs have been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety, which may serve as promising candidates to treat the infection of 2019 nCoV.	1
3185	Previously, it was thought that coronaviruses only cause enzootic infections in a number of animals, including certain birds and mammals, but recent findings indicate that a variety of these viruses, including antigenic groups 1 (229E and NL63), antigenic groups 2 (OC43), and HKU1, can infect humans [5, 6]. Since there is still little information available regarding 2019 nCoV, relatively similar genetic features between 2019 nCoV and SARS CoV indicate that the novel coronavirus can be vulnerable to disinfectants such as for surfaces and 10,000 ppm or 1% for blood spills), 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, 62–71% ethanol, and phenolic and quaternary ammonium compounds if utilized in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.	1

The human conductive respiratory tract spans a long anatomical distance and represents an important barrier to constrain invading respiratory pathogens. The disparate ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract have been demonstrated to influence the replication kinetics of common cold viruses as well as the associated host responses. Here, we employed the human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) culture model to investigate the impact of ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract, 33°C and 37°C, respectively, on the viral replication kinetics and host innate immune response dynamics during SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV infections. Strikingly, SARS CoV 2, in contrast to SARS CoV, replicated more efficiently at temperatures encountered in the upper respiratory tract, and displayed higher sensitivity to type I and type III IFNs than SARS CoV. Timeresolved transcriptome analysis highlighted a temperature dependent induction of IFN mediated antiviral response, whose amplitude inversely correlated with the replication kinetic efficiencies of both SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV at temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Altogether, these data reflect clinical features of SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV and subsequently, their associated human to human transmission efficiencies. They provide crucial insights of the profound impact of ambient temperatures on viral replication and associated pivotal virus  host interaction dynamics. This knowledge can be 2."	0

The proportions of this epidemics is probably one of the largest challenges faced by our interconnected modern societies. According to the current epidemiological reports, the large basic reproduction number, R0 ∼ 2.3, number of secondary cases produced by an infected individual in a population of susceptible individuals, as well as an asymptomatic period (up to 14 days) in which infectious individuals are undetectable without further analysis, pave the way for a major crisis of the national health capacity systems. Recent scientific reports have pointed out that the detected cases of COVID19 at young ages is strikingly short and that lethality is concentrated at large ages. Here we adapt a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) metapopulation mobility model to capture the spread of COVID 19. We propose a model that stratifies the population by ages, and account for the different incidences of the disease at each strata. The model is used to predict the incidence of the epidemics in a spatial population through time, permitting investigation of control measures. The model is applied to the current epidemic in Spain, using the estimates of the epidemiological parameters and the mobility and demographic census data of the national institute of statistics (INE). The results indicate that the peak of incidence will happen in the first half of April 2020 in absence of mobility restrictions. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and can be adapted to precise mobility restrictions at the level of municipalities. The current estimates largely compromises the Spanish health capacity system, in particular that for intensive care units, from the end of March. However, the model allows for the scrutiny of containment measures that can be used for health authorities to forecast with accuracy their impact in prevalence of COVID 19. Here we show by testing different epidemic containment scenarios that we urge to enforce total lockdown to avoid a massive collapse of the Spanish national health system.	0
3194	"There is a worldwide shortage of reagents to perform detection of SARS CoV 2. Many clinical diagnostic laboratories rely on commercial platforms that provide integrated end to end solutions. While this provides established robust pipelines, there is a clear bottleneck in the supply of reagents given the current situation of extraordinary high demand. Some laboratories resort to implementing kit free handling procedures, but many other small laboratories will not have the capacity to develop those and/or will perform manual handling of their samples. In order to provide multiple workflows for SARS CoV 2 nucleic acid detection we compared several commercially available RNA extraction methods: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN), the recently developed RNAdvance Blood (Beckman) and Mag Bind Viral DNA/RNA 96 Kit (Omega Bio tek). We also compared different 1 step RT qPCR Master Mix brands: TaqMan™ Fast Virus 1 Step Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific), qPCRBIO Probe 1 Step Go Lo ROX (PCR Biosystems) and Luna® Universal Probe One Step RT qPCR Kit (NEB). We used the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) recommended primers that detect two regions of the viral N gene as well as those that detect the RdRP gene region as per Public Health England (PHE) guidelines (Charité/WHO/PHE). Our data show that the RNA extraction methods provide similar results. Amongst the qPCR reagents tested, TaqMan™ Fast Virus 1 Step Master Mix and Luna® Universal Probe One 
Step RT qPCR Kit proved most sensitive. The N1 and N2 primer probes provide a more reliable detection than the RdRP_SARSr primer probe set, particularly in samples with low viral titres. Importantly, we have implemented a protocol using heat inactivation and demonstrate that it has minimal impact on the sensitivity of the qPCR in clinical samples  potentially making SARS CoV 2 testing portable to settings that do not have CL 3 facilities. In summary, we provide several testing pipelines that can be easily implemented in other laboratories and have made all our protocols and SOPs freely available at https://osf.io/uebvj/."	0

3199	"The World Health Organization has recently declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID 27 19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2, as pandemic. There is 28 currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response elicited from SARS CoV 2 29 infection. One major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences 30 between SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV. We address this question by using plasma from 31 patients infected by SARS CoV 2 or SARS CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or 32 immunized mice. Our results show that while cross reactivity in antibody binding to the 33 spike protein is common, cross neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the 34 presence of non neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike.
Whether these non neutralizing antibody responses will lead to antibody dependent 36 disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future.

3200	The dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the cell surface glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate (HS) for the regulation of homeostasis is exploited by many microbial pathogens as a means of adherence and invasion. The closely related polysaccharide heparin, the widely used anticoagulant drug, which is structurally similar to HS and is a common experimental proxy, can be expected to mimic the properties of HS. Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses if added exogenously, including S associated coronavirus strain HSR1 and here, we show that the addition of heparin (100 μg.ml  1 ) to vero cells inhibits invasion by SARS CoV 2 by 70%. We also demonstrate that heparin binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain and induces a conformational change, illustrated by surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy studies. The structural features of heparin on which this interaction depends were investigated using a library of heparin derivatives and size defined fragments. Binding is more strongly dependent on the presence of 2 O or 6 O sulphation, and the consequent conformational consequences in the heparin structure, than on N sulphation. A hexasaccharide is required for conformational changes to be induced in the secondary structure that are comparable to those that arise from heparin binding. Enoxaparin, a low molecular weight clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces conformational change. These findings have implications for the rapid development of a first line therapeutic by repurposing heparin as well as for next generation, tailor made, GAG based antiviral agents against SARS CoV 2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.	0

Les critères usuels du diagnostic positif d'une pneumonie aiguë communautaire sont cliniques et radiologiques. La confirmation microbiologique de l'infection n'est donc pas nécessaire au diagnostic. Malgré la multiplicité des techniques microbiologiques actuellement disponibles, aucune n'a suffisamment de sensibilité et de spécificité pour influencer l'antibiothérapie initiale qui demeure donc le plus souvent probabiliste. En cas de documentation microbiologique positive, une adaptation secondaire du traitement peut toutefois être envisagée. Au cours des exacerbations aiguës des bronchopneumopathies chroniques obstructives, le seul examen utile est l'analyse cytobactériologique des sécrétions bronchiques qui sera réalisée dans certaines circonstances (antibiothérapie antérieure, hospitalisation, échec du traitement probabiliste). © 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia is usually based on clinical and radiological criteria. The identification of a causative organism is not required for the diagnosis. Although numerous microbiological techniques are available, their sensitivity and specificity are not high enough to guide first line antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, this treatment remains most often empiric. If the causative organism is identified, the antimicrobial treatment is adapted. Sputum analysis may be proposed as a diagnostic tool for patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in specific cases (prior antibiotherapy, hospitalization, failure of the empiric antimicrobial treatment)."	0
3202	"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has caused severe damage to the world. With the support of classic evolutionary theories and population genetics principles, many studies on the origin of SARS CoV 2 have revealed encouraging results but meanwhile some are still under debate. We are concerned with the validity of applying classic evolutionary theories and formula to the evolution of RNA viruses. We have raised several confounding factors like the RNA replication feature and the RNA modification systems of the hosts, which might jeopardize the validity of the application of classic methods to analyze the SARS CoV 2 data.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has caused severe damage to China, especially the Hubei province [1] [2] [3] . Recently, the cases in China are coming under control but the situation in some other countries has become exacerbated. It is urgent to find ways to control its transmission and cure the infected patients.
The emergence of papers on the evolution of SARS CoV 2 is as fast as the spread of the virus itself. Based on genome sequencing followed by sequence alignment and sequence similarity analysis, researchers have characterized the evolutionary patterns of SARS CoV 2 and postulated its origins. Theories of bat origin [4] [5] [6] and pangolin origin [7, 8] emerged and even the snake plays an intermediate role in the transmission of SARS CoV 2 [9] . Many other similar studies and results are not exhaustively listed here at all. In a word, it seems that the continuous change of theories on the evolution of SARS CoV 2 even exceeds the evolution rate of the virus itself. It seems that several results appear to be encouraging. For example, a recent paper by Tang et al. [10] has taken advantage of RNA seq data. By traditional mutation calling pipeline, the authors discovered two lineages (L and S) of SARS CoV 2, and claimed that the L type is more virulent than S type based on their frequency among the population. This might be a typical bioinformatic study that informs us of the scenario of SARS CoV 2 population and evolution. The 'snake' paper [9] also emphasized the important fact that viruses adapt to the host expression system, so that their codon content should adapt to the host environment. No matter whether the final conclusion is correct or not, the main contribution is that the associated terminologies like relative synonymous codon usage and codon adaptation index are nicely incorporated in the relevant studies, indicating a correlation between the codon content of host and parasite.
As far as we know, the classic theories and principles of evolutionary biology, especially population genetics, are based on the central dogma, where DNA should be first transcribed to RNA and then produce proteins, and meanwhile the DNA replicates itself under a certain error rate. The validity of many formula/software is also based on multiple hidden hypotheses such as random mating, bi allelic DNA, bi sexual gender and infinite population size.
However, SARS CoV 2 is a positive strand RNA virus. It reproduces its own RNA by RNA replication. We doubt the validity of applying classic evolutionary theories and formula to the evolution of RNA viruses. In this Future Virol. (Epub ahead of print)"	0
3203	From an economic perspective, China has emerged as one of the leading countries in the production of various commodities, especially in the past decade, and given the enormous volume of trade, tourism and military transactions with other countries, there was no doubt that the virus would spread to other parts of the world (4). According to WHO report, COVID 19 disease among children seems to be rare with mild symptoms, about 2.4% of total cases were reported in children and adolescents (aged under 19 years), while older cases aged over 60 years and those with a background of chronic diseases were at higher risk of developing severe disease and death (22). Although, it may be too soon to compare the effectiveness of surveillance systems for COVID 19 epidemic in different countries, it seems that the Chinese surveillance system is highly effective as it ensures timely detection, recording, tracking, updating and sharing information on media for an outbreak with unknown origin and high burden of cases (4).	0

Presence and absence of virus at Day6 post inclusion was considered the end point.
Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms.
Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6 post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.
Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load azithromycin."	0

3206	Autophagy is an important mechanism for tumor escape, allowing tumor cells to recover from the damage induced by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy and contributing to the development of resistance. The pharmacological inhibition of autophagy contributes to increase the efficacy of antineoplastic agents. Exposing tumor cells to low concentrations of select autophagy inducing antineoplastic agents increases their immunogenicity and enhances their ability to stimulate dendritic cell (DC) maturation. We tested whether the application of an autophagy inhibiting agent, chloroquine (CQ), in combination with low concentrations of 5 fluorouracil (5 FU) increases the ability of tumor cells to induce DC maturation. DCs sensitized with the lysate of HCT 116 cells previously exposed to such a combination enhanced the DC maturation/activation ability. These matured DCs also increased the allogeneic responsiveness of both CD4  and CD8  T cells, which showed a greater proliferative response than those from DCs sensitized with control lysates. The T cells expanded in such cocultures were CD69  and PD 1 and produced higher levels of IFN γ and lower levels of IL 10, consistent with the preferential activation of Th1 cells. Cocultures of autologous DCs and lymphocytes improved the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, as assessed by the expression of CD107a, perforin, and granzyme B. The drug combination increased the expression of genes related to the CEACAM family (BECN1, ATGs, MAPLC3B, ULK1, SQSTM1) and tumor suppressors (PCBP1). Furthermore, the decreased expression of genes related to metastasis and tumor progression (BNIP3, BNIP3L, FOSL2, HES1, LAMB3, LOXL2, NDRG1, P4HA1, PIK3R2) was noted. The combination of 5 FU and CQ increases the ability of tumor cells to drive DC maturation and enhances the ability of DCs to stimulate T cell responses.	0
3207	The rapid global spread of the novel, pathogenic, SARS CoV 2 causing the severe acute respiratory disease COVID 19, becomes a major health problem worldwide and pose the need for international predictive programs. Given the lack of both specific drugs and an efficient preventive might decrease in temperate regions during summer, dominated in the social scene. Here, we attempted a prediction of the worldwide spread of the infections based on climatic data, expressed by bioclimatic variables. The calculated probability maps shown that potential areas of infection follow a shift from the Tropical to Temperate and Mediterranean Bioclimatic regions. Maps show an increased probability of infections in Europe, followed by an expansion covering areas of the Middle East and Northern Africa, as well as Eastern coastal areas of North America, South Eastern coastal areas of Latin America and two areas of Southern Australia. Our approach may, therefore, be of value for the incorporation of climatic influences in the design and implementation of public health policies.

Asthma is an inflammatory disorder of the airways involving coordinate up regulation of T H 2 type cytokines encoded in a cluster on chromosome 5q 31 33 on T cells and inflammatory cells. There is also a requirement for local airway susceptibility factors that, together with T H 2 polarization, results in hyperresponsiveness, variable airflow obstruction, and, over time, remodeling of the airway wall. Asthma has strong genetic and environmental components that interact both in the induction and subsequent expression of the disease phenotypes. Multiple genes are involved and probably interact. Whole genome screens are beginning to identify gene rich regions of special relevance to asthma and atopy, although a novel disease related gene has yet to be discovered from these. By contrast, there are a plethora of candidate genes whose function in relation to disease pathophysiologic mechanisms and response to treatment are known. Two examples are polymorphisms involving IL 4 receptors and the enzymes controlling cysteinyl leukotriene production. Abnormal signaling between the epithelium, which is in contact with the environment, and the underlying (myo)fibroblasts and dendritic cells indicating reactivation of the epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit, which is involved in fetal lung development and branching, provide a basis for asthma that encapsulates both T H 46.)"	0

Few patients can compete with the chronically diarrheic cat in imparting such a sense of frustration in the clinician. When faced with such a cat, it often seems that logic and basic scientific principles go out the window and both the patient and client suffer because of the veterinarian's failure to properly investigate the pathophysiologic basis of the diarrhea.
In 1977, Gruffyd Jones and colleagues at the University of Bristol, England, described an apparently new syndrome of cats consisting of chronic diarrhea and protrusion of the nictitating membrane. 22 Soon afterward, numerous letters appeared in the correspondence columns relating the experience of practicing veterinarians with similar cats.

SARS CoV 2 has a robust person to person transmission rate and an asymptomatic period of two weeks or more, leading to widespread infection that has overwhelmed healthcare infrastructures around the globe. Effective public health measures require extensive, accurate, and rapid testing to determine infection rates. Here we describe the strategy we used to establish a CLIA licensed clinical laboratory to perform a validated Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) for SARS CoV 2 in Berkeley, California and the surrounding Bay Area community. Our procedures for implementing the technical, regulatory, and data management workstreams necessary for clinical sample processing provide a roadmap to aid others in setting up similar testing centers.

3215	The coronavirus disease (COVID 19) is highly pathogenic viral infection caused by SARS CoV 2. Currently, COVID 19 has caused global health concern. It is assumed that COVID 19 has zoonotic origin based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet market in Wuhan City, China. The phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS CoV 2 has significant sequence similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome like (SARS like) bat viruses, thus bats could be primary possible reservoir. The intermediate host and there subsequent transfer is not known yet, although human to human transfer is widely confirmed. The transmission of COVID 19 infection from one person to another resulted in the isolation of patients who were subsequently given a variety of treatments. To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID 19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc. No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID 19 is reported yet. However, in clinical trials, few broad spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID 19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery. In this article emergence and pathogenicity	1

3217	Background: In this systematic review and meta analysis, we aimed to explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and severe coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with COVID 19 pneumonia. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search from several databases. Definition of cardiac injury follows that of the included studies, which includes highly sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs cTnl) N99th percentile.The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were ARDS, the need for ICU care, and severe COVID 19. ARDS and severe COVID 19 were defined per the World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) of COVID 19. Results: There were a total of 2389 patients from 13 studies. This meta analysis showed that cardiac injury was associated with higher mortality (RR 7.95 [5.12, 12.34], p b 0.001; I 2 : 65%). Cardiac injury was associated with higher need for ICU care (RR 7.94 [1.51, 41.78], p = 0.01; I 2 : 79%), and severe COVID 19 (RR 13.81 [5.52, 34 .52], p b 0.001; I 2 : 0%). The cardiac injury was not significant for increased risk of ARDS (RR 2.57 [0.96, 6 .85], p = 0.06; I 2 : 84%). The level of hs cTnI was higher in patients with primary   secondary outcome (mean difference 10.38 pg/mL [4.44, 16.32], p = 0.002; I 2 : 0%). Conclusion: Cardiac injury is associated with mortality, need for ICU care, and severity of disease in patients with COVID 19.	0

The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID 19) caused by SARS CoV 2 infection is spreading globally and quickly, leading to emerging health issues. SARS CoV 2 enters into and infects host cells through its spike glycoprotein recognizing the cell receptor Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here, we noticed that ACE2 was further enhanced by SARS CoV 2 infection. Human germ cells and early embryos express high level of ACE2. Notably, RNA seq result showed that reduction of H3K27me3, but not H3K4/9/36me3, led to upregulation of Ace2 expression in mouse germ cell line GC 2. In agreement with this result, we found in human embryonic stem cells that ACE2 expression was significantly increased in absence of EZH2, the major enzyme catalyzing H3K27me3. ChIP seq analysis further confirmed decrease of H3K27me3 signal and increase of H3K27ac signal at ACE2 promoter upon EZH2 knockout. Therefore, we propose that EZH2 mediated H3K27me3 at ACE2 promoter region inhibits ACE2 expression in mammalian cells. This regulatory pattern may also exist in other human cells and tissues. Our discovery provides clues for pathogenesis and targeted drug therapy towards ACE2 expression for prevention and adjuvant therapy of COVID 19."	1

A SurveyMonkey® based electronic survey was conducted amongst members of the Indian Rheumatology Association to understand the need for changes in prevailing practices.
Of the 861 invitees, 221 responded. In the wake of the pandemic, 47.5% would reduce biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) while only 12.2% would reduce the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs. 64.2% were likely to defer change in IS, the reluctance being most with rituximab (58.3%) followed by cyclophosphamide (53.3%), anti tumor necrosis factor alpha agents (52.4%) and Janus kinase inhibitors (34.39%).
Hydroxychloroquine was the preferred choice (81.9%) for the treatment of COVID 19 followed by protease inhibitors (22.1%) and intravenous immunoglobulin (8.1%).
Chloroquine was less preferred (19%). More than two thirds (70.5%) believed that COVID 19 might trigger macrophage activation syndrome. Social distancing (98.1%) and hand hygiene (74.6%) were recommended by majority. 62.8% would avoid touch for clinical examination whenever feasible.

NBCZone: Universal three dimensional construction of eleven amino acids near the catalytic nucleophile and base in the superfamily of (chymo)trypsin like serine fold proteases (Chymo)trypsin like serine fold proteases belong to the serine/cysteine proteases found in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. Their catalytic activity is carried out using a triad of amino acids, a nucleophile, a base, and an acid. For this superfamily of proteases, we propose the existence of a universal 3D structure comprising 11 amino acids near the catalytic nucleophile and base  Nucleophile Base Catalytic Zone (NBCZone). The comparison of NBCZones among 169 eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and viral (chymo)trypsin like proteases suggested the existence of 15 distinct groups determined by the combination of amino acids located at two ""key"" structure functional positions 54 T and 55 T near the catalytic base His57 T . Most eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteases fell into two major groups, [ST]A and TN. Usually, proteases of [ST]A group contain a disulfide bond between cysteines Cys42 T and Cys58 T of the NBCZone. In contrast, viral proteases were distributed among seven groups, and lack this disulfide bond. Furthermore, only the [ST]A group of eukaryotic proteases contains glycine at position 43 T , which is instrumental for activation of these enzymes. In contrast, due to the side chains of residues at position 43 T prokaryotic and viral proteases do not have the ability to carry out the structural transition of the eukaryotic zymogen zyme type."	0

When compared with IHR (1969), the adoption of IHR (2005) represents a crucial expansion in the rules’ coverage from three predefined transmittable diseases to any event that could be considered a “public health emergency of international concern” – and, as a matter of principle, this includes any outbreak of a transmittable disease. Subsequent examinations of the handling of this epidemic are unanimously critical and go so far as to maintain that better preparedness and a faster, more coordinated response may have prevented most of the 11,000 deaths directly attributed to Ebola, as well as the broader economic, social and health crises that ensued from the epidemic."	0

The outcomes of NCP patients were phase summarized at our institution. Three kinds of responses to clinical treatment were defined and evaluated: 1) good, symptoms continually improved; 2) fair, symptoms not improved or relapsed; 3) poor, symptoms aggravated. The risk factors, including basal clinical characteristics, CT imaging features, and follow up CT changes (no change, progress, and improvement) related to poor/fair outcomes, were also investigated. Results: Six patients were improved to no emergency type, 2 remained the same, and 2 progressed to fatal type. Besides, 13 patients progressed from the common type group to the emergency group (3 in fatal type and 10 in severe type). Forty two (35.6%) patients were discharged with a median hospital stay of 9.5 days (range, 4.0 15.0 days). Thus, the numbers in different responses were, 73 patients in good response group (4 emergency cases, 69 no emergency cases), 28 in fair response group (3 emergency cases, 25 no emergency cases), and 17 in poor response group (3 emergency cases, 14 no emergency cases). No patient has died in our hospital to date. The median duration of progress observed from CT scans was 6 days (range, 2 14 days). The progression in abnormal imaging findings indicate a poor/fair response, whereas the alleviated symptoms seen from CT suggest a good response. Conclusion: Most cases are no emergency type and have a favorable response to clinical treatment. Follow up CT changes during the treatment can help evaluate the treatment response of patients with NCP.	0
3242	"IL 1β has emerged as a key mediator of the cytokine storm linked to high morbidity and mortality from COVID 19 and blockade of the IL 1 receptor (IL 1R) with Anakinra has entered clinical trials in subjects. Yet, knowledge of the specific immune cell subsets targeted by IL 1β and IL 1β induced signaling pathways in humans is limited. Utilizing mass cytometry (CyTOF) of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we identified effector memory CD4 T cells and CD4  CD8 low/ CD161   T cells as the circulating immune subtypes with the greatest expression of p NF κB in response to IL 1β stimulation.
Notably, CCR6 distinctly identified T cells most responsive to IL 1β. Other subsets including CD11c myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), classical monocytes (CM), two subsets of natural killer cells (CD16  CD56 bright CD161and CD16  CD56 dim CD161   ) and a population of lineage  (Lin ) cells expressing CD161 and CD25 also showed IL 1β induced expression of p NF kB. The IL 1R antagonist, Anakinra significantly inhibited IL 1β induced p NF kB in the CCR6   T cells and CD11c mDCs with a trending inhibition in CD14 monocytes and Lin  CD161   CD25   cells. IL 1β also induced a rapid but much less robust increase in p p38 expression as compared to p NF kB in the majority of these same immune cell subsets. Prolonged IL 1β stimulation greatly increased p STAT3 and to a much lesser extent p STAT1 and p STAT5 in T cell subsets, monocytes, DCs and the Lin  CD161   CD25   cells suggesting IL 1βinduced production of downstream STAT activating cytokines, consistent with its role in cytokine storm.
Interindividual heterogeneity and inhibition of this activation by Anakinra raises the intriguing possibility that assays to measure IL 1β induced p NF kB in CCR6   T cell subtypes could identify those at higher risk of cytokine storm and those most likely to benefit from Anakinra therapy. author/funder.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Peripheral blood from healthy volunteers was obtained after written informed consent under the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol   16017).
Blood from healthy donors was drawn into BD K2 EDTA vacutainer tubes and processed at room temperature (RT) within one hour of collection. Whole blood in vacutainers were centrifuged at 400 x g for 10 minutes at RT to remove platelet rich plasma. PBMCs were separated by Ficoll Paque densitygradient centrifugation (Ficoll Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare Biosciences AB) and SepMate 50 (Stemcell Technologies Inc) following the manufacturer's protocol. Trypan blue staining was performed to get live cell counts. PBMCs were cryopreserved in freezing solution (90% FBS/10% DMSO). PBMC vials were stored in Mr. Frosty (Thermo Fisher) for 48 hours at  80°C and were then stored in liquid nitrogen until used.
All metal conjugated antibodies were purchased from Fluidigm and purified unlabeled antibodies from the vendors as shown in Supplementary Table 1 . Unlabeled antibodies were conjugated in house using the MaxPAR antibody labeling kit (Fluidigm) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After determining the percent yield by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm, metal labeled antibodies were diluted in Candor PBS Antibody Stabilization solution (Candor Bioscience GmbH) for long term storage at 4°C.
Cryopreserved PBMCs were used for CyTOF panel optimization. Antibody titrations were perfomed to determine optimal antibody concentrations. For titration of phospho signaling antibodies, PBMCs were stimulated with PMA/Ionomycin (50 nM/1 µg/ml) for 15 minutes. To capture IL 1β induced transient signaling, PBMCs needed to be fixed immediately with paraformaldehyde (PFA, 1.6% final concentration) post stimulation. As such, impact of PFA on integrity of surface marker epitopes was evaluated. PFA fixation led to significant loss of CXCR4, CXCR5, CCR6, CCR7 and CD127 staining while increased non specific binding of CXCR3 (Supplementary Fig. 1) . As such, an alternative approach was utilized to label cells with these PFA labile antibodes. A small volume of a cocktail of author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. : bioRxiv preprint these PFA labile antibodies was added simultaneously during IL 1β stimulation of PBMCs prior to PFA fixation. Antibody addition during PBMC stimulation did not interfere with IL 1β mediated signaling ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , while allowed specific staining. Preliminary analysis did not show expression of p JNK and ribosomal protein p S6, an AKT effector upon IL 1β stimulation so these markers were excluded from the panel.
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and washed twice with warm complete media (RPMI supplemented with 5% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and Pen Strep). All PBMC samples had viability in the range of 85 98%. 1 2 x 10 6 cells per stimulation were used. Prior to IL 1β (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) stimulation, PBMCs were rested in 1.8 ml low retention eppendorf tubes (Fisherbrand) for 1 hour at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . At the end of the stimulation period, PFA (1.6% final concentration) methanol free, Ultra Pure EM grade, Polysciences, Inc) was immediately added to the PBMC suspension, mixed by vortexing, and cells were incubated at RT for 10 minutes. PFA was then diluted at least to 0.8% or lower with ice cold Maxpar Cell Staining Buffer (CSB) (Fluidigm), and fixed cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 minutes at RT. PBMC samples were barcoded using the palladium based 20 Plex Pd Barcoding Kit (Fluidigm) according to the manufacturer's protocol. As PBMCs were fixed with PFA, which is similar to the Maxpar Fix I Buffer, this step was excluded and cells were washed twice with 1 ml of 1x Maxpar Barcode Perm Buffer. Barcoded cells were then combined into a single tube prior to Fc receptor blocking (BD Biosciences) and staining with a cocktail of metal conjugated antibodies against cell surface markers for 30 minutes at RT with frequent gentle shaking. After washing once with the CSB, cells were resuspended in residual CSB and chilled on ice for 5 minutes. For cell permeabilization, 0.5 ml of 100% ice cold methanol was added to the cells, and samples were vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Eppendorf tubes were filled up with the CSB and samples were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 minutes at RT. An additional wash with the CSB was performed to remove residual methanol prior to staining with antibodies against intracellular phospho markers for 45 minutes at RT. After washing, cell were fixed with 2% PFA for 10 minutes at RT, washed again and cell pellet stored overnight at 4°C. Next day, stained cells were incubated with iridium DNA intercalator (Fluidigm) in Maxpar Fix and Perm Buffer (Fluidigm) for 20 minutes at RT. Prior to acquisition, cells were washed once with CSB followed by two washes with the Maxpar Cell Acquisition Solution (Fluidigm). Cells were filtered through a 40 μm membrane just before being acquired on a Helios mass cytometer (Fluidigm).
EQ Four Element Calibration Beads from Fluidigm were added as per the manufacturer's directions prior to running.

3243	s u m m a r y Results: Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2 7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12 20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8 11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P < 0.0 0 01). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10 12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU ( P < 0.0 0 01). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR = 0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission. Conclusions: The majority of COVID 19 cases are mild. The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID 19.	0
3244	"Background Elucidation of the chain of disease transmission and identification of the source of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) infections are crucial for effective disease containment. We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID 19.
In Singapore, active case finding and contact tracing were undertaken for all COVID 19 cases. Diagnosis for acute disease was confirmed with RT PCR testing. When epidemiological information suggested that people might have been nodes of disease transmission but had recovered from illness, SARS CoV 2 IgG serology testing was used to establish past infection.
RT PCR testing because they had active disease, except for A2, who at the time of testing had recovered from their illness and tested negative. This individual was eventually diagnosed with past infection by serological testing. ELISA assays showed an optical density of more than 1·4 for SARS CoV 2 nucleoprotein and receptor binding domain antigens in titres up to 1/400, and viral neutralisation was noted in titres up to 1/320.
Interpretation Development and application of a serological assay has helped to establish connections between COVID 19 clusters in Singapore. Serological testing can have a crucial role in identifying convalescent cases or people with milder disease who might have been missed by other surveillance methods."	0

3247	"Italy currently constitutes the epicenter of the novel coronavirus disease : medRxiv preprint sweeping through Lombardy, which remains in lockdown since the 8th of March.
As of the same day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy have been extended to the entire country. Here, we provide estimates for: (a) the DAY ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of exposed/infected cases in the total population; (c) the basic reproduction number (R 0 ); (d) the ""effective"" per day disease transmission; and, importantly, (e) a forecast for the fade out of the outbreak, on the basis of the COVID 19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29.
Methods. To deal with the uncertainty in the number of actual exposed/ infected cases in the total population, we address a compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the total cases in the population and another modelling the confirmed cases. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death, the case fatality ratio, and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID 19. For the estimation of the DAY ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the ""effective"" per day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the SEIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March, the lockdown day of Lombardy and of all Italy. This was accomplished by solving a mixed integer optimization problem with the aid of genetic algorithms. Based on the computed values, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number R 0 .

3248	"We model the extent to which age targeted quarantine can be used to reduce ICU admissions caused by novel coronavirus COVID 19. Using demographic data from New Zealand, we demonstrate that lowering the age threshold for quarantine to 50 years of age reduces ICU admissions drastically, and show that for sufficiently strict isolation protocols, isolating one third of the countries population for a total of 6 months is sufficient to avoid overwhelming ICU capacity throughout the entire course of the epidemic. Similar results are expected to hold for other countries, though some minor adaption will be required based on local age demographics and hospital facilities.

3249	We consider an epidemic process on adaptive activity driven temporal networks, with adaptive behaviour modelled as a change in activity and attractiveness due to infection. By using a meanfield approach, we derive an analytical estimate of the epidemic threshold for SIS and SIR epidemic models for a general adaptive strategy, which strongly depends on the correlations between activity and attractivenesses in the susceptible and infected states. We focus on a strong adaptive behaviour, implementing two types of quarantine inspired by recent real case studies: an active quarantine, in which the population compensates the loss of links rewiring the ineffective connections towards non quarantining nodes, and an inactive quarantine, in which the links with quarantined nodes are not rewired. Both strategies feature the same epidemic threshold but they strongly differ in the dynamics of active phase. We show that the active quarantine is extremely less effective in reducing the impact of the epidemic in the active phase compared to the inactive one, and that in SIR containment.	0
3250	Since December 2019, A novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) has been breaking out in China, which can cause respiratory diseases and severe pneumonia. Epidemic models relying on the incidence rate of new cases for forecasting epidemic outbreaks have received increasing attention. However, many prior works in this area mostly focus on the application of the traditional SIR model and disregard the transmission characteristics of 2019 nCoV, exceptionally the infectious of undiagnosed cases. Here, we propose a SUIR model based on the classical SIR model object to supervise the effective prediction, prevention, and control of infectious diseases. SUIR model adds a unique U (Undiagnosed) state of the epidemic and divides the population into four states: S (Susceptible), U (Undiagnosed), I (Infectious and Uninfectious), and R (Recovered). This approach enables us to predict the incidence of 2019 nCoV effectively and the clear advantage of the model accuracy more reliable than the traditional SIR model.	0

3257	Backgrounds: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID 19) pneumonia hit Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread to the rest of China and overseas. The emergence of this virus coincided with the Spring Festival Travel Rush in China. It is possible to estimate total number of cases of COVID 19 in Wuhan, by 23 January 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities. Methods: We built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from different sources between Wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation. Findings: From overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different source of data from Changjiang Daily newspaper, Tencent, and Baidu. From separate cities/regions data, we estimated 1059 (95% CI: 918, 1209), 5214 (95% CI: 4659, 5808) as total cases in Wuhan in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different sources of population flow data from Tencent and Baidu.

3258	We have applied a computational strategy, using a combination of virtual screening, docking and molecular dynamics techniques, aimed at identifying possible lead compounds for the non covalent inhibition of the main protease 3CL pro of the SARS CoV2 Coronavirus. Based on the X ray structure (PDB code: 6LU7), ligands were generated using a multimodal structure based design and then docked to the monomer in the active state. Docking calculations show that ligand binding is strikingly similar in SARS CoV and SARS CoV2 main proteases. The most potent docked ligands are found to share a common binding pattern with aromatic moieties connected by rotatable bonds in a pseudo linear arrangement.	0

Establishing a system for logistical planning, and accurate information sharing is strongly recommended. Infection control remains the ultimate goal. As such, healthcare workers should be educated on universal and isolation precautions, and the appropriate use of personal protective equipment. Social distancing should be encouraged to prevent the spread of infection, and creative and innovative ways to reduce contact may need to be considered.

Coronaviruses infect a wide range of animals and cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases of varying severity [1]. They cause severe diseases in livestock animals and thereby lead to high economic losses [2] . Based on genotypic and serological character ization, coronaviruses are divided into 4 distinct groups. Their tendency for recombination and high mutation rates may allow their adaptation to new hosts and ecological niches [3] [4] [5] [6] .

SUMMARY
Tunisia since 2000, protection of chicks, especially broiler flocks, with Mass H120 vaccine often fails. Therefore, association of CR88 (793B type) with H120 vaccines was used for better response. Challenge experiments were then conducted to evaluate tracheal and renal crossprotection in chickens immunized via nasal and eye drops. Conferred protection was measured by clinical signs and macroscopic lesions observed, based on scores attributed according to their severities. The results showed a low protection conferred by H120 alone, as vaccination did not reduce tracheal and kidney lesions (70% scored as 3) after TN20/00 virus challenge, which also led to 10% mortality. Conversely, the challenge results indicated that the combination of the 2 strains (H120/CR88) allow high protection. Based on the results of the challenge experiments, a vaccination protocol coupling CR88 to H120 was applied for industrial broiler flocks. Clinical observations and serological results confirmed that association of heterologous serotypes (H120 and CR88 vaccines) increased the levels of protection against infectious bronchitis viruses compared with the H120 vaccine given alone."	0
3262	The objective of this article is to explore the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) interventions and its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for the containment of the pandemic spread of novel Coronavirus. The research adopted a qualitative research approach, while the study data were collected through online content review and Focus Group Discussion (FGD). Starting with a preliminary set of about 1200 electronic resources or contents, 56 were selected for review study, applying an inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review study revealed ICT interventions that include websites and dashboards, mobile applications, robotics and drones, artificial intelligence (AI), data analytic, wearable and sensor technology, social media and learning tools, and interactive voice response (IVR) as well as explored their respective usages to combat the pandemic spread of COVID 19. Later, the FGD was replicated with 22 participants and explored the possible strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of deploying such technologies to fight against the COVID 19 pandemic. This research not only explores the exiting status of ICT interventions to fight with the COVID 19 pandemic but also provides a number of implications for the government, practitioners, doctors, policymakers and researchers for the effective utilization of the existing ICT interventions and for the future potential research and technological development to the containment of the pandemic spread of COVID 19 and future pandemics.	0
3263	Public health preparedness for coronavirus disease 2019 is challenging in the absence of setting specific epidemiological data. Here we describe the epidemiology of seasonal human coronaviruses (sCoVs) and other cocirculating viruses in the West of Scotland, UK. We analyzed routine diagnostic data for >70,000 episodes of respiratory illness tested molecularly for multiple respiratory viruses between 2005 and 2017. Statistical associations with patient age and sex differed between CoV 229E, CoV OC43 and CoV NL63. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of sCoV outbreaks did not occur concurrently and coinfections were not reported. With respect to other cocirculating respiratory viruses, we found evidence of positive, rather than negative, interactions with sCoVs. These findings highlight the importance of considering cocirculating viruses in the differential diagnosis of COVID 19. Further work is needed to establish the occurrence/degree of cross protective immunity conferred across sCoVs and with COVID 19, as severity.	0

3267	"There is a rich history of models for the interaction of a biological contagion like influenza with the spread of related information such as an influenza vaccination campaign. Recent work on the spread of interacting contagions on networks has highlighted that these interacting contagions can have counter intuitive interplay with network structure. Here we generalize one of these frameworks to tackle three important features of the spread of awareness and disease: one, we model the dynamics on highly clustered, cliquish, networks to mimic the role of workplaces and households; two, the awareness contagion affects the spread of the biological contagion by reducing its transmission rate where an aware or vaccinated individual is less likely to be infected; and three, the biological contagion also affects the spread of the awareness contagion but by increasing its transmission rate where an infected individual is more receptive and more likely to share information related to the disease. Under these conditions, we find that increasing network clustering, which is known to hinder disease spread, can actually allow them to sustain larger epidemics of the disease in models with awareness. This counter intuitive result goes against the conventional wisdom suggesting that random networks are justifiable as they provide worst case scenario forecasts. To further investigate this result, we provide a closed form criterion based on a two step branching process (i.e., the numbers of expected tertiary infections) to identify different regions in parameter space where the net effect of clustering and co infection varies. Altogether, our results highlight once again the need to go beyond random networks in disease modeling and illustrate the type of analysis that is possible even in complex models of interacting contagions.
Epidemics of infectious diseases obviously interact with human behaviour, and mathematical models provide a principled way of studying these interactions. Unfortunately, the same scenario becomes less tractable when behaviour is affected by a social contagion, such as the  FlattenTheCurve message currently spreading on social media in the hope of slowing the spread of COVID 19. Interactions across contagions are multi dimensional: The messaging raises awareness and slows the spread of the disease around aware individuals by promoting hand washing and social distancing, and individuals who are experiencing the illness are also more likely to spread preventive messages. We model these interactions as a system of parasitic contagions where the awareness both benefit from and hinders the spread of the disease. We Models of contagion are used to study the transmission dynamics of a pathogen or information being transmitted through a structured population. Most of these are defined as compartmental models [1], which mathematically distinguishes individuals based on their state; i.e., whether they are susceptible to a contagion or infectious with that contagion. Using this approach, coupling different contagions to model their interactions is straightforward as we can then simply distinguish individuals based on all possible combinations of states for the different contagions. Of particular interest is the coupling of an infectious disease with the spread of preventative information related to the disease [2]. We typically expect this ""disease awareness"" to at least hinder, if not completely stop, the spread of the pathogen. Since both the pathogen and the information spread through standard contagion mechanisms, their coupled dynamics is often referred to as either antagonistic or dueling contagions. Here, we assume that the coupling between awareness and disease is twofold: Awareness reduces the transmission rate of a disease, but sees its own transmission rate increased by the presence of the disease. Studies in health psychology suggest that individuals are more likely to adopt preventative behaviors related to a disease  hand wawashing, self isolation, vaccination, treatment seeking  if people around them adopt that behavior and/or if they perceive themselves to be at high risk of infection [3, 4] . Indeed, data collected during and after the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak and the 2009 A (H1N1) influenza pandemic indicate the adoption of preventative behaviors such as increased hand washing, the use of face masks, and avoiding crowded public spaces in response to these outbreaks and the increased perception of infection risk [5] [6] [7] . We therefore refer to this coupled awareness disease system as one of parasitic contagions, since one contagion (awareness) both hurts and benefits from the other (the disease).
Research on dueling or parasitic contagions tend to assume well mixed populations [2, 8] , in line with classic epidemic models. However, there are a number of generalized frameworks that account for the fact that information and disease both spread over a network structure [9] [10] [11] , and these frameworks have become more common in recent years with the rise in popularity of multiplex or multilayer network models [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . In the current work, we relax the well mixed assumption to consider the community structure of most networks where connections are often grouped in dense environments such as households and workplaces. To do so, we rely on two recent mathematical approaches: (i) a compartmental model coupled to a clique based master equation formalism [17, 18] that explicitly tracks the state of different groups; and (ii) a more straightforward two step branching process analysis [18] that approximates network clustering.
In Section 2 we present our general model of interacting contagion and provide the mean field formalism to follow its evolution. We find that the impact of network clustering on the interaction of disease and awareness can be non trivial to predict, and can even accelerate the spread of the disease. In Section 2.5, we then develop a purely analytical tool based on a two step branching process to better inform us of the net effect of clustering on the dynamics. The two approaches are leveraged together in a case study presented in Section 3 where we show that there can be finite regions in parameter space where the disease can actually benefit from network clustering. Section 4 provides conclusions and outlines potential areas of future work. Altogether, our results raise potential questions about optimal coupling between the epidemiological parameters of a disease, the behavioral parameters of awareness, and the network structure of the population."	0
3268	In this paper, a generalized fractional order SEIR model is proposed, denoted by SEIQRP model, which has a basic guiding significance for the prediction of the possible outbreak of infectious diseases like COVID 19 and other insect diseases in the future. Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number R 0 is derived. When R 0 < 1, the disease free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When R 0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID 19 spread in the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID 19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.	0

Objectives were to determine effects of lactation and pregnancy on endometrial gene expression on d 17 of the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Heifers (n = 33) were assigned randomly after parturition to lactating (L, n = 17) or nonlactating (NL, n = 16) groups. Cows were subjected to an ovulation synchronization program for a timed artificial insemination (TAI); 10 cows in L and 12 in NL were inseminated. Slaughter occurred 17 d after the day equivalent to TAI, and intercaruncular endometrial tissues were collected. Gene expression was determined by DNA microarray analysis for pregnant (L, n = 8; NL, n = 6) and noninseminated cyclic (L, n = 7; NL, n = 4) cows. Differentially expressed genes were selected with a P value <0.01 and absolute expression >40. In addition, a fold effect >1.5 was used as a criterion for genes affected by pregnancy. In total, 210 genes were differentially regulated by lactation (136 downregulated and 74 upregulated), and 702 genes were differentially regulated by pregnancy (407 downregulated and 295 upregulated). The interaction effect of pregnancy and lactation affected 61 genes. Genes up and downregulated in pregnant cows were associated with several gene ontology terms, such as defense response and interferon regulatory factor, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix. The gene ontology analyses of up and downregulated genes of lactating cows revealed terms related to immunoglobulin like fold, immune response, COMM domain, and non membrane bounded organelle. Several genes upregulated by lactation, such as IGHG1, IGLL1, IGK, and TRD, were related to immune function, particularly for B cells and γδ T cells. Developmental genes related to limb and neural development and glucose homeostasis (e.g., DKK1, RELN, PDK4) were downregulated by lactation, whereas an interaction was also detected for RELN. The stated genes associated with immune function and developmental genes expressed in the endometrium affected by lactational state are possible candidate genes for interventions to improve fertility of lactating dairy cows."	0
3275	Compared with other mammals, bats harbor more zoonotic viruses per species and do not demonstrate signs of disease on infection with these viruses. To counteract infections with viruses, bats have evolved enhanced mechanisms to limit virus replication and immunopathology. However, molecular and cellular drivers of antiviral responses in bats largely remain an enigma. In this study, we demonstrate that a serine residue in IRF3 is positively selected for in multiple bat species. IRF3 is a central regulator of innate antiviral responses in mammals. Replacing the serine residue in bat IRF3 with the human leucine residue decreased antiviral protection in bat cells, whereas the addition of this serine residue in human IRF3 significantly enhanced antiviral protection in human cells. Our study provides genetic and functional evidence for enhanced IRF3 mediated antiviral responses in bats and adds support to speculations that bats have positively selected for multiple adaptations in their antiviral immune responses.	1

 Second, the virus possesses both an extremely efficient human transmission capacity and a long asymptomatic incubation period (1–14 days, compared to 2–7 days of SARS), two factors that, combined, make it difficult to detect and quickly circumscribe the infected population within a limited geographical range. 15


If all of these requirements are fulfilled and if the party affected by the impediment invokes force majeure in compliance with other contractual requirements (form, time limit), then the clause provides for a remedial scheme, which in most cases is based on the interplay of suspension of performance, exemption from liability for non performance and termination of contract. In a smaller number of cases, the contractual remedial scheme may contain alternative solutions – more commonly to be found in hardship clauses – aimed at preserving the contract, namely a duty to renegotiate the terms of the transaction (which in itself does not imply a duty to reach agreement on new terms) or the endowment of a third party or a court circumstances."	0
3277	Italy is currently experiencing the largest COVID 19 outbreak in Europe so far, with more than 100,000 confirmed cases. Following the identification of the first infections, on February 21, 2020, national authorities have put in place an increasing number of restrictions aimed at containing the outbreak and delaying the epidemic peak. Since March 12, the whole country is under lockdown. Here we provide the first quantitative assessment of the impact of such measures on the mobility and between Italian provinces, following the lockdown. In the same week, the average users' radius of gyration has declined by about 50% and the average degree of the users' proximity network has dropped by 47% at national level.	1
3278	The 2019 novel coronavirus disease has now swept through the continents and poses a global threat to public health. Several investigations have been conducted to identify whether COVID 19 can be transmitted through the ocular route, and the conclusion is that it is a potential route but remains uncertain. Due to the faceto face communication with patients, frequent exposure to tears and ocular discharge, and the unavoidable use of equipment which requires close proximity, ophthalmologists carry a high risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). Based on 33 articles published by Chinese scholars, guidelines and clinical practice experience in domestic hospitals, we have summarized the Chinese experience through the	1

The aim of this work is to describe the 2017 2018 influenza season and how it affected elderly population in Catalonia despite moderate vaccine coverage among this age group. Methods: Influenza surveillance based on a primary care sentinel surveillance, virological indicators systematic sampling of ILI attended and severe influenza confirmed cases (SHLCI) admitted to hospital. Analysis of data by Chi squared, ANOVA, multiple regression and negative control test or case to case for vaccine effectiveness assessment in primary care and SHLCI respectively. Results: Moderate high intensity and early onset season with predominance of influenza B virus (IVB) (63%) followed by an increase of circulation of influenza A virus (IVA). A total of 419 IV from primary care samples. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) in primary care setting was 14% (95%CI: 0 47%). 1306 severe cases (adjusted cumulative incidence 18.54/100,000 inhabitants (95%CI: 17.54 19.55)). The highest proportion of severe cases were in the >64 (65.1%) (aOR 15.70; 95%CI: 12.06 20.46; p < 0.001) followed by 45 64 yo (25.4%) (aOR 6.03; 95%CI: 4.57 7.97).
VE in preventing intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 35% (95%CI: 10 54%). Final outcome death while hospitalized occurred in 175 SHLCI cases with a case fatality rate of 13.4%.
Conclusions: 2017 2018 influenza season was an unusual epidemic season with an early onset, great predominance of influenza B (Yamagata strain) virus with a high hospitalization rate of severe cases among elderly stressing the need to upgrade vaccine uptake in this age group.
Conclusiones: La temporada de gripe 2017 2018 fue una temporada epidémica inusual con un inicio temprano, gran predominio del VGB (cepa Yamagata) con una elevada tasa de hospitalización de casos graves en ancianos, lo que subraya la necesidad de mejorar la aceptación de la vacuna en este grupo de edad."	0
3280	The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease has spread globally and poses a threat to public health in more than 200 countries. Reliable laboratory diagnosis of the disease has been one of the foremost priorities for promoting public health interventions. The routinely used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) is currently the reference method for COVID 19 diagnosis. However, it also reported a number of false positive or  negative cases, especially in the early stages of the novel virus outbreak. In this work, a dual functional plasmonic biosensor combining the plasmonic photothermal (PPT) effect and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensing transduction provides an alternative and promising solution for the clinical COVID 19 diagnosis. The two dimensional gold nanoislands (AuNIs) functionalized with complementary DNA receptors can perform a sensitive detection of the selected sequences from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) through nucleic acid hybridization. For better sensing performance, the thermoplasmonic heat is generated on the same AuNIs chip when illuminated at their plasmonic resonance frequency. The localized PPT heat is capable to elevate the in situ hybridization temperature and facilitate the accurate discrimination of two similar gene sequences. Our dual functional LSPR biosensor exhibits a high sensitivity toward the selected SARS CoV 2 sequences with a lower detection limit down to the concentration of 0.22 pM and allows precise detection of the specific target in a multigene mixture. This study gains insight into the thermoplasmonic enhancement diagnosis.	0
3281	Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS CoV 2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human to human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2 10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62e71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05e0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no specific therapies are available for SARS CoV 2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.	1
3282	"The SARS CoV 2 (COVID 19) pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to our society. It has compelled clinicians to re examine our roles as physicians, educators, family members and citizens.
Consultation liaison (C L) psychiatrists stand at the convergence of psychiatry and the rest of medicine. Like most medical specialties, C L psychiatry is forced to adapt during the pandemic, possibly bringing permanent changes to our profession.
Due to an almost universal lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) in the health care facilities of this country, as well as inadequate testing for COVID 19, many C L psychiatry services have implemented telepsychiatry options, usually reserved for under resourced areas. Although the goldstandard of consultation involves in person evaluation of the patient, it is clear that this crisis calls for the use of technology to decrease viral transmission. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of telemedicine when possible, limits on the number of staff providing care to COVID 19  patients, and use of dedicated healthcare providers who care only for COVID  patients during a shift. 1 It would be simple to reflexively respond to this challenge by insisting that our service, in its fully staffed form, is an indispensable entity in the hospital. After all, we care for extraordinarily sick patients, we rely on physical exam findings including a thorough neurological exam, and we manage conditions, such as hyperactive delirium, catatonia and severe alcohol withdrawal, which require frequent visual assessments.
As of 4/9/20, over 9000 healthcare workers in the US have been confirmed to have COVID 19, with at least 27 confirmed deaths. 2 Due to lack of testing or inadequate reporting, these numbers are likely much higher.
As staff are increasingly lost to illness or quarantine, it becomes apparent that for the sake of personnel safety, we must adjust how we work. Ideally, we shift to a hybrid model, working remotely when possible, reserving face to face contact for circumstances where virtual care might pose more risk than benefit. ""Seeing"" a consult patient remotely is not shirking of the Hippocratic oath, rather a wise adaptation in the face of a dangerous pathogen. Workforce preservation becomes essential to not only maintain a healthy number of clinicians, but to ensure psychological health. We must protect our greatest resource, each other.
Besides the obvious practical advantages of conserving PPE, minimizing infection risk for providers and patients, and maximizing workforce, transitioning to a hybrid model, where a proportion of consults are performed virtually, may have training advantages. One of the most challenging skills for trainees to master is determining the extent of involvement required for a specific consult. Trainees must learn to be thorough, avoid premature closure, and resist tunnel vision focused on the specific consult question. They must recognize that not every consultation requires a soup to nuts evaluation, understanding the value in a brief, focused assessment. A hybrid approach to patient care on the C L service, with some evaluations completed by chart review, telephone encounter or video, creates an opportunity for trainees to learn valuable lessons about triage.
C L psychiatry is often the most visible provider of psychiatric care within the hospital. As such, medical center leadership will look to us as experts in mental healthcare delivery systems. Most of the care that we provide as psychiatrists, across all settings, remains poorly understood by hospital"	0
